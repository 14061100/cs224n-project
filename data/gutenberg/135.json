{"summary": "\n\nThe story begins in 1815 in Digne, as the peasant Jean Valjean, just released from 19 years' imprisonment in the galleys—five for stealing bread for his starving sister and her family and fourteen more for numerous escape attempts—is turned away by innkeepers because his yellow passport marks him as a former convict. He sleeps on the street, angry and bitter.\nDigne's benevolent Bishop Myriel gives him shelter. At night, Valjean runs off with Myriel's silverware. When the police capture Valjean, Myriel pretends that he has given the silverware to Valjean and presses him to take two silver candlesticks as well, as if he had forgotten to take them. The police accept his explanation and leave. Myriel tells Valjean that his life has been spared for God, and that he should use money from the silver candlesticks to make an honest man of himself.\nValjean broods over Myriel's words. When opportunity presents itself, purely out of habit, he steals a 40-sous coin from 12-year-old Petit Gervais and chases the boy away. He quickly repents and searches the city in panic for Gervais. At the same time, his theft is reported to the authorities. Valjean hides as they search for him, because if apprehended he will be returned to the galleys for life as a repeat offender.\nSix years pass and Valjean, using the alias Monsieur Madeleine, has become a wealthy factory owner and is appointed mayor of a town identified only as M____-sur-M__ (i.e., Montreuil-sur-Mer). Walking down the street, he sees a man named Fauchelevent pinned under the wheels of a cart. When no one volunteers to lift the cart, even for pay, he decides to rescue Fauchelevent himself. He crawls underneath the cart, manages to lift it, and frees him. The town's police inspector, Inspector Javert, who was an adjutant guard at the Bagne of Toulon during Valjean's incarceration, becomes suspicious of the mayor after witnessing this remarkable feat of strength. He has known only one other man, a convict named Jean Valjean, who could accomplish it.\nYears earlier in Paris, a grisette named Fantine was very much in love with Félix Tholomyès. His friends, Listolier, Fameuil, and Blachevelle were also paired with Fantine's friends Dahlia, Zéphine, and Favourite. The men abandon the women, treating their relationships as youthful amusements. Fantine must draw on her own resources to care for her and Tholomyès' daughter, Cosette. When Fantine arrives at Montfermeil, she leaves Cosette in the care of the Thénardiers, a corrupt innkeeper and his selfish, cruel wife.\nFantine is unaware that they are abusing her daughter and using her as forced labor for their inn, and continues to try to meet their growing, extortionate and fictitious demands. She is later fired from her job at Jean Valjean's factory, because of the discovery of her daughter, who was born out of wedlock. Meanwhile, the Thénardiers' monetary demands continue to grow. In desperation, Fantine sells her hair and two front teeth, and she resorts to prostitution to pay the Thénardiers. Fantine is slowly dying from an unspecified disease.\nA dandy named Bamatabois harasses Fantine in the street, and she reacts by striking him. Javert arrests Fantine. She begs to be released so that she can provide for her daughter, but Javert sentences her to six months in prison. Valjean (Mayor Madeleine) intervenes and orders Javert to release her. Javert resists but Valjean prevails. Valjean, feeling responsible because his factory turned her away, promises Fantine that he will bring Cosette to her. He takes her to a hospital.\nJavert comes to see Valjean again. Javert admits that after being forced to free Fantine, he reported him as Valjean to the French authorities. He tells Valjean he realizes he was wrong, because the authorities have identified someone else as the real Jean Valjean, have him in custody, and plan to try him the next day. Valjean is torn, but decides to reveal himself to save the innocent man, whose real name is Champmathieu. He travels to attend the trial and there reveals his true identity. Valjean returns to M____-sur-M__ to see Fantine, followed by Javert, who confronts him in her hospital room.\nAfter Javert grabs Valjean, Valjean asks for three days to bring Cosette to Fantine, but Javert refuses. Fantine discovers that Cosette is not at the hospital and fretfully asks where she is. Javert orders her to be quiet, and then reveals to her Valjean's real identity. Weakened by the severity of her illness, she falls back in shock and dies. Valjean goes to Fantine, speaks to her in an inaudible whisper, kisses her hand, and then leaves with Javert. Later, Fantine's body is unceremoniously thrown into a public grave.\n\n\nValjean escapes, is recaptured, and is sentenced to death. The king commutes his sentence to penal servitude for life. While imprisoned at the military port of Toulon, Valjean, at great personal risk, rescues a sailor caught in the ship's rigging. Spectators call for his release. Valjean fakes his own death by allowing himself to fall into the ocean. Authorities report him dead and his body lost.\nValjean arrives at Montfermeil on Christmas Eve. He finds Cosette fetching water in the woods alone and walks with her to the inn. He orders a meal and observes how the Thénardiers abuse her, while pampering their own daughters Éponine and Azelma, who mistreat Cosette for playing with their doll. Valjean leaves and returns to make Cosette a present of an expensive new doll which, after some hesitation, she happily accepts. Éponine and Azelma are envious. Madame Thénardier is furious with Valjean, while her husband makes light of Valjean's behaviour, caring only that he pay for his food and lodging.\nThe next morning, Valjean informs the Thénardiers that he wants to take Cosette with him. Madame Thénardier immediately accepts, while Thénardier pretends to love Cosette and be concerned for her welfare, reluctant to give her up. Valjean pays the Thénardiers 1,500 francs, and he and Cosette leave the inn. Thénardier, hoping to swindle more out of Valjean, runs after them, holding the 1,500 francs, and tells Valjean he wants Cosette back. He informs Valjean that he cannot release Cosette without a note from the child's mother. Valjean hands Thénardier Fantine's letter authorizing the bearer to take Cosette. Thénardier then demands that Valjean pay a thousand crowns, but Valjean and Cosette leave. Thénardier regrets that he did not bring his gun and turns back toward home.\nValjean and Cosette flee to Paris. Valjean rents new lodgings at Gorbeau House, where he and Cosette live happily. However, Javert discovers Valjean's lodgings there a few months later. Valjean takes Cosette and they try to escape from Javert. They soon find shelter in the Petit-Picpus convent with the help of Fauchelevent, the man whom Valjean once rescued from being crushed under a cart and who has become the convent's gardener. Valjean also becomes a gardener and Cosette becomes a student at the convent school.\n\nEight years later, the Friends of the ABC, led by Enjolras, are preparing an act of anti-Orléanist civil unrest on the eve of the Paris uprising on 5–6 June 1832, following the death of General Lamarque, the only French leader who had sympathy towards the working class. Lamarque was a victim of a major cholera epidemic that had ravaged the city, particularly its poor neighborhoods, arousing suspicion that the government had been poisoning wells. The Friends of the ABC are joined by the poor of the Cour des miracles, including the Thénardiers' eldest son Gavroche, who is a street urchin.\nOne of the students, Marius Pontmercy, has become alienated from his family (especially his grandfather M. Gillenormand) because of his liberal views. After the death of his father Colonel Georges Pontmercy, Marius discovers a note from him instructing his son to provide help to a sergeant named Thénardier who saved Pontmercy's life at Waterloo – in reality Thénardier was looting corpses and only saved Pontmercy's life by accident; he had called himself a sergeant under Napoleon to avoid exposing himself as a robber.\nAt the Luxembourg Garden, Marius falls in love with the now grown and beautiful Cosette. The Thénardiers have also moved to Paris and now live in poverty after losing their inn. They live under the surname \"Jondrette\" at Gorbeau House (coincidentally, the same building Valjean and Cosette briefly lived in after leaving the Thénardiers' inn). Marius lives there as well, next door to the Thénardiers.\nÉponine, now ragged and emaciated, visits Marius at his apartment to beg for money. To impress him, she tries to prove her literacy by reading aloud from a book and by writing \"The Cops Are Here\" on a sheet of paper. Marius pities her and gives her some money. After Éponine leaves, Marius observes the \"Jondrettes\" in their apartment through a crack in the wall. Éponine comes in and announces that a philanthropist and his daughter are arriving to visit them. In order to look poorer, Thénardier puts out the fire and breaks a chair. He also orders Azelma to punch out a window pane, which she does, resulting in cutting her hand (as Thénardier had hoped).\nThe philanthropist and his daughter enter—actually Valjean and Cosette. Marius immediately recognizes Cosette. After seeing them, Valjean promises them he will return with rent money for them. After he and Cosette leave, Marius asks Éponine to retrieve her address for him. Éponine, who is in love with Marius herself, reluctantly agrees to do so. The Thénardiers have also recognized Valjean and Cosette, and vow their revenge. Thénardier enlists the aid of the Patron-Minette, a well-known and feared gang of murderers and robbers.\nMarius overhears Thénardier's plan and goes to Javert to report the crime. Javert gives Marius two pistols and instructs him to fire one into the air if things get dangerous. Marius returns home and waits for Javert and the police to arrive. Thénardier sends Éponine and Azelma outside to look out for the police. When Valjean returns with rent money, Thénardier, with Patron-Minette, ambushes him and he reveals his real identity to Valjean. Marius recognizes Thénardier as the man who \"saved\" his father's life at Waterloo and is caught in a dilemma.\nHe tries to find a way to save Valjean while not betraying Thénardier. Valjean denies knowing Thénardier and tells him that they have never met. Valjean tries to escape through a window but is subdued and tied up. Thénardier orders Valjean to pay him 200,000 francs. He also orders Valjean to write a letter to Cosette to return to the apartment, and they would keep her with them until he delivers the money. After Valjean writes the letter and informs Thénardier of his address, Thénardier sends out Mme. Thénardier to get Cosette. Mme. Thénardier comes back alone, and announces the address is a fake.\nIt is during this time that Valjean manages to free himself. Thénardier decides to kill Valjean. While he and Patron-Minette are about to do so, Marius remembers the scrap of paper that Éponine wrote on earlier. He throws it into the Thénardiers' apartment through the wall crack. Thénardier reads it and thinks Éponine threw it inside. He, Mme. Thénardier and Patron-Minette try to escape, only to be stopped by Javert.\nHe arrests all the Thénardiers and Patron-Minette (except Claquesous, who escapes during his transportation to prison; Montparnasse, who stops to run off with Éponine instead of joining in on the robbery; and Gavroche, who was not present and rarely participates in his family's crimes, a notable exception being his part in breaking his father out of prison). Valjean manages to escape the scene before Javert sees him.\n\n\nAfter Éponine's release from prison, she finds Marius at \"The Field of the Lark\" and sadly tells him that she found Cosette's address. She leads him to Valjean's and Cosette's house on Rue Plumet, and Marius watches the house for a few days. He and Cosette then finally meet and declare their love for one another. Thénardier, Patron-Minette and Brujon manage to escape from prison with the aid of Gavroche. One night, during one of Marius's visits with Cosette, the six men attempt to raid Valjean's and Cosette's house. However, Éponine, who has been sitting by the gates of the house, threatens to scream and awaken the whole neighbourhood if the thieves do not leave. Hearing this, they reluctantly retire. Meanwhile, Cosette informs Marius that she and Valjean will be leaving for England in a week's time, which greatly troubles the pair.\nThe next day, Valjean is sitting in the Champ de Mars. He is feeling troubled about seeing Thénardier in the neighbourhood several times. Unexpectedly, a note lands in his lap, which says \"Move Out.\" He sees a figure running away in the dim light. He goes back to his house, tells Cosette they will be staying at their other house on Rue de l'Homme Arme, and reconfirms to her that they will be moving to England. Marius tries to get permission from M. Gillenormand to marry Cosette. His grandfather seems stern and angry, but has been longing for Marius's return. When tempers flare, he refuses his assent to the marriage, telling Marius to make Cosette his mistress instead. Insulted, Marius leaves.\nThe following day, the students revolt and erect barricades in the narrow streets of Paris. Gavroche spots Javert and informs Enjolras that Javert is a spy. When Enjolras confronts him about this, he admits his identity and his orders to spy on the students. Enjolras and the other students tie him up to a pole in the Corinth restaurant. Later that evening, Marius goes back to Valjean's and Cosette's house on Rue Plumet, but finds the house no longer occupied. He then hears a voice telling him that his friends are waiting for him at the barricade. Distraught to find Cosette gone, he heeds the voice and goes.\nWhen Marius arrives at the barricade, the \"revolution\" has already started. When he stoops down to pick up a powder keg, a soldier comes up to shoot Marius. However, a man covers the muzzle of the soldier's gun with his hand. The soldier fires, fatally shooting the man, while missing Marius. Meanwhile, the soldiers are closing in. Marius climbs to the top of the barricade, holding a torch in one hand, a powder keg in the other, and threatens to the soldiers that he will blow up the barricade. After confirming this, the soldiers retreat from the barricade.\nMarius decides to go to the smaller barricade, which he finds empty. As he turns back, the man who took the fatal shot for Marius earlier calls Marius by his name. Marius discovers this man is Éponine, dressed in men's clothes. As she lies dying on his knees, she confesses that she was the one who told him to go to the barricade, hoping they would die together. She also confesses to saving his life because she wanted to die before he did.\nThe author also states to the reader that Éponine anonymously threw the note to Valjean. Éponine then tells Marius that she has a letter for him. She also confesses to have obtained the letter the day before, originally not planning to give it to him, but decides to do so in fear he would be angry at her about it in the afterlife. After Marius takes the letter, Éponine then asks him to kiss her on the forehead when she is dead, which he promises to do. With her last breath, she confesses that she was \"a little bit in love\" with him, and dies.\nMarius fulfills her request and goes into a tavern to read the letter. It is written by Cosette. He learns Cosette's whereabouts and he writes a farewell letter to her. He sends Gavroche to deliver it to her, but Gavroche leaves it with Valjean. Valjean, learning that Cosette's lover is fighting, is at first relieved, but an hour later, he puts on a National Guard uniform, arms himself with a gun and ammunition, and leaves his home.\n\nValjean arrives at the barricade and immediately saves a man's life. He is still not certain if he wants to protect Marius or kill him. Marius recognizes Valjean at first sight. Enjolras announces that they are almost out of cartridges. When Gavroche goes outside the barricade to collect more ammunition from the dead National Guardsmen, he is shot by the troops.\n\nValjean volunteers to execute Javert himself, and Enjolras grants permission. Valjean takes Javert out of sight, and then shoots into the air while letting him go. Marius mistakenly believes that Valjean has killed Javert. As the barricade falls, Valjean carries off the injured and unconscious Marius. All the other students are killed. Valjean escapes through the sewers, carrying Marius's body. He evades a police patrol, and reaches an exit gate but finds it locked. Thénardier emerges from the darkness. Valjean recognizes him, but his filthy appearance prevents Thénardier from recognizing him. Thinking Valjean a murderer lugging his victim's corpse, Thénardier offers to open the gate for money. As he searches Valjean and Marius's pockets, he surreptitiously tears off a piece of Marius's coat so he can later find out his identity. Thénardier takes the thirty francs he finds, opens the gate, and allows Valjean to leave, expecting Valjean's emergence from the sewer will distract the police who have been pursuing him.\nUpon exiting, Valjean encounters Javert and requests time to return Marius to his family before surrendering to him. Javert agrees, assuming that Marius will be dead within minutes. After leaving Marius at his grandfather's house, Valjean asks to be allowed a brief visit to his own home, and Javert agrees. There, Javert tells Valjean he will wait for him in the street, but when Valjean scans the street from the landing window he finds Javert has gone. Javert walks down the street, realizing that he is caught between his strict belief in the law and the mercy Valjean has shown him. He feels he can no longer give Valjean up to the authorities but also cannot ignore his duty to the law. Unable to cope with this dilemma, Javert commits suicide by throwing himself into the Seine.\nMarius slowly recovers from his injuries. As he and Cosette make wedding preparations, Valjean endows them with a fortune of nearly 600,000 francs. As their wedding party winds through Paris during Mardi Gras festivities, Valjean is spotted by Thénardier, who then orders Azelma to follow him. After the wedding, Valjean confesses to Marius that he is an ex-convict. Marius is horrified, assumes the worst about Valjean's moral character, and contrives to limit Valjean's time with Cosette. Valjean accedes to Marius' judgment and his separation from Cosette. Valjean loses the will to live and retires to his bed.\nThénardier approaches Marius in disguise, but Marius recognizes him. Thénardier attempts to blackmail Marius with what he knows of Valjean, but in doing so, he inadvertently corrects Marius's misconceptions about Valjean and reveals all of the good he has done. He tries to convince Marius that Valjean is actually a murderer, and presents the piece of coat he tore off as evidence. Stunned, Marius recognizes the fabric as part of his own coat and realizes that it was Valjean who rescued him from the barricade. Marius pulls out a fistful of notes and flings it at Thénardier's face. He then confronts Thénardier with his crimes and offers him an immense sum to depart and never return. Thénardier accepts the offer, and he and Azelma travel to America where he becomes a slave trader.\nAs they rush to Valjean's house, Marius tells Cosette that Valjean saved his life at the barricade. They arrive to find Valjean near death and are reconciled with him. Valjean tells Cosette her mother's story and name. He dies content and is buried beneath a blank slab in Père Lachaise Cemetery.\n\n", "full_text": "LES MISERABLES\n\nBy Victor Hugo\n\n\nTranslated by Isabel F. Hapgood\n\nThomas Y.

MYRIEL\n\nIn 1815, M. Charles-Francois-Bienvenu Myriel was Bishop of D---- He was\nan old man of about seventy-five years of age; he had occupied the see\nof D---- since 1806.\n\nAlthough this detail has no connection whatever with the real substance\nof what we are about to relate, it will not be superfluous, if merely\nfor the sake of exactness in all points, to mention here the various\nrumors and remarks which had been in circulation about him from the very\nmoment when he arrived in the diocese. True or false, that which is said\nof men often occupies as important a place in their lives, and above all\nin their destinies, as that which they do. M. Myriel was the son of a\ncouncillor of the Parliament of Aix; hence he belonged to the nobility\nof the bar. It was said that his father, destining him to be the heir of\nhis own post, had married him at a very early age, eighteen or twenty,\nin accordance with a custom which is rather widely prevalent in\nparliamentary families. In spite of this marriage, however, it was said\nthat Charles Myriel created a great deal of talk. He was well formed,\nthough rather short in stature, elegant, graceful, intelligent; the\nwhole of the first portion of his life had been devoted to the world and\nto gallantry.\n\nThe Revolution came; events succeeded each other with precipitation; the\nparliamentary families, decimated, pursued, hunted down, were dispersed.\nM. Charles Myriel emigrated to Italy at the very beginning of the\nRevolution. There his wife died of a malady of the chest, from which she\nhad long suffered. He had no children. What took place next in the fate\nof M. Myriel? The ruin of the French society of the olden days, the fall\nof his own family, the tragic spectacles of '93, which were, perhaps,\neven more alarming to the emigrants who viewed them from a distance,\nwith the magnifying powers of terror,--did these cause the ideas of\nrenunciation and solitude to germinate in him? Was he, in the midst of\nthese distractions, these affections which absorbed his life, suddenly\nsmitten with one of those mysterious and terrible blows which sometimes\noverwhelm, by striking to his heart, a man whom public catastrophes\nwould not shake, by striking at his existence and his fortune? No one\ncould have told: all that was known was, that when he returned from\nItaly he was a priest.\n\nIn 1804, M. Myriel was the Cure of B---- [Brignolles]. He was already\nadvanced in years, and lived in a very retired manner.\n\nAbout the epoch of the coronation, some petty affair connected with\nhis curacy--just what, is not precisely known--took him to Paris.\nAmong other powerful persons to whom he went to solicit aid for his\nparishioners was M. le Cardinal Fesch. One day, when the Emperor\nhad come to visit his uncle, the worthy Cure, who was waiting in the\nanteroom, found himself present when His Majesty passed. Napoleon,\non finding himself observed with a certain curiosity by this old man,\nturned round and said abruptly:--\n\n\"Who is this good man who is staring at me?\"\n\n\"Sire,\" said M. Myriel, \"you are looking at a good man, and I at a great\nman. Each of us can profit by it.\"\n\nThat very evening, the Emperor asked the Cardinal the name of the Cure,\nand some time afterwards M. Myriel was utterly astonished to learn that\nhe had been appointed Bishop of D----\n\nWhat truth was there, after all, in the stories which were invented as\nto the early portion of M. Myriel's life? No one knew. Very few families\nhad been acquainted with the Myriel family before the Revolution.\n\nM. Myriel had to undergo the fate of every newcomer in a little town,\nwhere there are many mouths which talk, and very few heads which think.\nHe was obliged to undergo it although he was a bishop, and because\nhe was a bishop. But after all, the rumors with which his name\nwas connected were rumors only,--noise, sayings, words; less than\nwords--palabres, as the energetic language of the South expresses it.\n\nHowever that may be, after nine years of episcopal power and of\nresidence in D----, all the stories and subjects of conversation which\nengross petty towns and petty people at the outset had fallen into\nprofound oblivion. No one would have dared to mention them; no one would\nhave dared to recall them.\n\nM. Myriel had arrived at D---- accompanied by an elderly spinster,\nMademoiselle Baptistine, who was his sister, and ten years his junior.\n\nTheir only domestic was a female servant of the same age as Mademoiselle\nBaptistine, and named Madame Magloire, who, after having been the\nservant of M. le Cure, now assumed the double title of maid to\nMademoiselle and housekeeper to Monseigneur.\n\nMademoiselle Baptistine was a long, pale, thin, gentle creature; she\nrealized the ideal expressed by the word \"respectable\"; for it seems\nthat a woman must needs be a mother in order to be venerable. She\nhad never been pretty; her whole life, which had been nothing but a\nsuccession of holy deeds, had finally conferred upon her a sort of\npallor and transparency; and as she advanced in years she had acquired\nwhat may be called the beauty of goodness. What had been leanness in\nher youth had become transparency in her maturity; and this diaphaneity\nallowed the angel to be seen. She was a soul rather than a virgin. Her\nperson seemed made of a shadow; there was hardly sufficient body to\nprovide for sex; a little matter enclosing a light; large eyes forever\ndrooping;--a mere pretext for a soul's remaining on the earth.\n\nMadame Magloire was a little, fat, white old woman, corpulent and\nbustling; always out of breath,--in the first place, because of her\nactivity, and in the next, because of her asthma.\n\nOn his arrival, M. Myriel was installed in the episcopal palace with\nthe honors required by the Imperial decrees, which class a bishop\nimmediately after a major-general. The mayor and the president paid the\nfirst call on him, and he, in turn, paid the first call on the general\nand the prefect.\n\nThe installation over, the town waited to see its bishop at work.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II--M. MYRIEL BECOMES M. WELCOME\n\n\nThe episcopal palace of D---- adjoins the hospital.\n\nThe episcopal palace was a huge and beautiful house, built of stone at\nthe beginning of the last century by M. Henri Puget, Doctor of Theology\nof the Faculty of Paris, Abbe of Simore, who had been Bishop of D---- in\n1712. This palace was a genuine seignorial residence. Everything about\nit had a grand air,--the apartments of the Bishop, the drawing-rooms,\nthe chambers, the principal courtyard, which was very large, with walks\nencircling it under arcades in the old Florentine fashion, and gardens\nplanted with magnificent trees. In the dining-room, a long and superb\ngallery which was situated on the ground-floor and opened on the\ngardens, M. Henri Puget had entertained in state, on July 29, 1714, My\nLords Charles Brulart de Genlis, archbishop; Prince d'Embrun; Antoine\nde Mesgrigny, the capuchin, Bishop of Grasse; Philippe de Vendome, Grand\nPrior of France, Abbe of Saint Honore de Lerins; Francois de Berton de\nCrillon, bishop, Baron de Vence; Cesar de Sabran de Forcalquier, bishop,\nSeignor of Glandeve; and Jean Soanen, Priest of the Oratory, preacher in\nordinary to the king, bishop, Seignor of Senez. The portraits of these\nseven reverend personages decorated this apartment; and this memorable\ndate, the 29th of July, 1714, was there engraved in letters of gold on a\ntable of white marble.\n\nThe hospital was a low and narrow building of a single story, with a\nsmall garden.\n\nThree days after his arrival, the Bishop visited the hospital. The visit\nended, he had the director requested to be so good as to come to his\nhouse.\n\n\"Monsieur the director of the hospital,\" said he to him, \"how many sick\npeople have you at the present moment?\"\n\n\"Twenty-six, Monseigneur.\"\n\n\"That was the number which I counted,\" said the Bishop.\n\n\"The beds,\" pursued the director, \"are very much crowded against each\nother.\"\n\n\"That is what I observed.\"\n\n\"The halls are nothing but rooms, and it is with difficulty that the air\ncan be changed in them.\"\n\n\"So it seems to me.\"\n\n\"And then, when there is a ray of sun, the garden is very small for the\nconvalescents.\"\n\n\"That was what I said to myself.\"\n\n\"In case of epidemics,--we have had the typhus fever this year; we\nhad the sweating sickness two years ago, and a hundred patients at\ntimes,--we know not what to do.\"\n\n\"That is the thought which occurred to me.\"\n\n\"What would you have, Monseigneur?\" said the director. \"One must resign\none's self.\"\n\nThis conversation took place in the gallery dining-room on the\nground-floor.\n\nThe Bishop remained silent for a moment; then he turned abruptly to the\ndirector of the hospital.\n\n\"Monsieur,\" said he, \"how many beds do you think this hall alone would\nhold?\"\n\n\"Monseigneur's dining-room?\" exclaimed the stupefied director.\n\nThe Bishop cast a glance round the apartment, and seemed to be taking\nmeasures and calculations with his eyes.\n\n\"It would hold full twenty beds,\" said he, as though speaking to\nhimself. Then, raising his voice:--\n\n\"Hold, Monsieur the director of the hospital, I will tell you something.\nThere is evidently a mistake here. There are thirty-six of you, in five\nor six small rooms. There are three of us here, and we have room for\nsixty. There is some mistake, I tell you; you have my house, and I have\nyours. Give me back my house; you are at home here.\"\n\nOn the following day the thirty-six patients were installed in the\nBishop's palace, and the Bishop was settled in the hospital.\n\nM. Myriel had no property, his family having been ruined by the\nRevolution. His sister was in receipt of a yearly income of five hundred\nfrancs, which sufficed for her personal wants at the vicarage. M. Myriel\nreceived from the State, in his quality of bishop, a salary of fifteen\nthousand francs. On the very day when he took up his abode in the\nhospital, M. Myriel settled on the disposition of this sum once for\nall, in the following manner. We transcribe here a note made by his own\nhand:--\n\n\nNOTE ON THE REGULATION OF MY HOUSEHOLD EXPENSES.\n\n  For the little seminary . . . . . . . . . . . . . .    1,500 livres\n  Society of the  mission . . . . . . . . . . . . . .      100   \"\n  For the Lazarists of Montdidier . . . . . . . . . .      100   \"\n  Seminary for foreign missions in Paris  . . . . . .      200   \"\n  Congregation of the Holy Spirit . . . . . . . . . .      150   \"\n  Religious establishments of the Holy Land . . . . .      100   \"\n  Charitable maternity societies  . . . . . . . . . .      300   \"\n  Extra, for that of Arles  . . . . . . . . . . . . .       50   \"\n  Work for the amelioration of prisons  . . . . . . .      400   \"\n  Work for the relief and delivery of prisoners . . .      500   \"\n  To liberate fathers of families incarcerated for debt  1,000   \"\n  Addition to the salary of the poor teachers of the\n       diocese  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .    2,000   \"\n  Public granary of the Hautes-Alpes  . . . . . . . .      100   \"\n  Congregation of the ladies of D----, of Manosque, and of\n       Sisteron, for the gratuitous instruction of poor\n       girls  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .    1,500   \"\n  For the poor  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .    6,000   \"\n  My personal expenses  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .    1,000   \"\n                                                        ------\n       Total  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .   15,000   \"\n\n\nM. Myriel made no change in this arrangement during the entire period\nthat he occupied the see of D---- As has been seen, he called it\nregulating his household expenses.\n\nThis arrangement was accepted with absolute submission by Mademoiselle\nBaptistine. This holy woman regarded Monseigneur of D---- as at one and\nthe same time her brother and her bishop, her friend according to the\nflesh and her superior according to the Church. She simply loved and\nvenerated him. When he spoke, she bowed; when he acted, she yielded her\nadherence. Their only servant, Madame Magloire, grumbled a little. It\nwill be observed that Monsieur the Bishop had reserved for himself\nonly one thousand livres, which, added to the pension of Mademoiselle\nBaptistine, made fifteen hundred francs a year. On these fifteen hundred\nfrancs these two old women and the old man subsisted.\n\nAnd when a village curate came to D----, the Bishop still found means to\nentertain him, thanks to the severe economy of Madame Magloire, and to\nthe intelligent administration of Mademoiselle Baptistine.\n\nOne day, after he had been in D---- about three months, the Bishop\nsaid:--\n\n\"And still I am quite cramped with it all!\"\n\n\"I should think so!\" exclaimed Madame Magloire. \"Monseigneur has not\neven claimed the allowance which the department owes him for the expense\nof his carriage in town, and for his journeys about the diocese. It was\ncustomary for bishops in former days.\"\n\n\"Hold!\" cried the Bishop, \"you are quite right, Madame Magloire.\"\n\nAnd he made his demand.\n\nSome time afterwards the General Council took this demand under\nconsideration, and voted him an annual sum of three thousand francs,\nunder this heading: Allowance to M. the Bishop for expenses of carriage,\nexpenses of posting, and expenses of pastoral visits.\n\nThis provoked a great outcry among the local burgesses; and a senator\nof the Empire, a former member of the Council of the Five Hundred\nwhich favored the 18 Brumaire, and who was provided with a magnificent\nsenatorial office in the vicinity of the town of D----, wrote to M.\nBigot de Preameneu, the minister of public worship, a very angry and\nconfidential note on the subject, from which we extract these authentic\nlines:--\n\n\"Expenses of carriage? What can be done with it in a town of less than\nfour thousand inhabitants? Expenses of journeys? What is the use\nof these trips, in the first place? Next, how can the posting be\naccomplished in these mountainous parts? There are no roads. No one\ntravels otherwise than on horseback. Even the bridge between Durance and\nChateau-Arnoux can barely support ox-teams. These priests are all thus,\ngreedy and avaricious. This man played the good priest when he\nfirst came. Now he does like the rest; he must have a carriage and a\nposting-chaise, he must have luxuries, like the bishops of the olden\ndays. Oh, all this priesthood! Things will not go well, M. le Comte,\nuntil the Emperor has freed us from these black-capped rascals. Down\nwith the Pope! [Matters were getting embroiled with Rome.] For my part,\nI am for Caesar alone.\" Etc., etc.\n\nOn the other hand, this affair afforded great delight to Madame\nMagloire. \"Good,\" said she to Mademoiselle Baptistine; \"Monseigneur\nbegan with other people, but he has had to wind up with himself, after\nall. He has regulated all his charities. Now here are three thousand\nfrancs for us! At last!\"\n\nThat same evening the Bishop wrote out and handed to his sister a\nmemorandum conceived in the following terms:--\n\nEXPENSES OF CARRIAGE AND CIRCUIT.\n\n  For furnishing meat soup to the patients in the hospital. 1,500 livres\n  For the maternity charitable society of Aix . . . . . . .   250   \"\n  For the maternity charitable society of Draguignan  . . .   250   \"\n  For foundlings  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .   500   \"\n  For orphans   . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .   500   \"\n                                                            -----\n       Total  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 3,000   \"\n\nSuch was M. Myriel's budget.\n\nAs for the chance episcopal perquisites, the fees for marriage bans,\ndispensations, private baptisms, sermons, benedictions, of churches or\nchapels, marriages, etc., the Bishop levied them on the wealthy with all\nthe more asperity, since he bestowed them on the needy.\n\nAfter a time, offerings of money flowed in. Those who had and those who\nlacked knocked at M. Myriel's door,--the latter in search of the alms\nwhich the former came to deposit. In less than a year the Bishop had\nbecome the treasurer of all benevolence and the cashier of all those\nin distress. Considerable sums of money passed through his hands, but\nnothing could induce him to make any change whatever in his mode of\nlife, or add anything superfluous to his bare necessities.\n\nFar from it. As there is always more wretchedness below than there\nis brotherhood above, all was given away, so to speak, before it was\nreceived. It was like water on dry soil; no matter how much money he\nreceived, he never had any. Then he stripped himself.\n\nThe usage being that bishops shall announce their baptismal names at the\nhead of their charges and their pastoral letters, the poor people of the\ncountry-side had selected, with a sort of affectionate instinct, among\nthe names and prenomens of their bishop, that which had a meaning for\nthem; and they never called him anything except Monseigneur Bienvenu\n[Welcome]. We will follow their example, and will also call him thus\nwhen we have occasion to name him. Moreover, this appellation pleased\nhim.\n\n\"I like that name,\" said he. \"Bienvenu makes up for the Monseigneur.\"\n\nWe do not claim that the portrait herewith presented is probable; we\nconfine ourselves to stating that it resembles the original.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III--A HARD BISHOPRIC FOR A GOOD BISHOP\n\n\nThe Bishop did not omit his pastoral visits because he had converted his\ncarriage into alms. The diocese of D---- is a fatiguing one. There are\nvery few plains and a great many mountains; hardly any roads, as we have\njust seen; thirty-two curacies, forty-one vicarships, and two hundred\nand eighty-five auxiliary chapels. To visit all these is quite a task.\n\nThe Bishop managed to do it. He went on foot when it was in the\nneighborhood, in a tilted spring-cart when it was on the plain, and on\na donkey in the mountains. The two old women accompanied him. When the\ntrip was too hard for them, he went alone.\n\nOne day he arrived at Senez, which is an ancient episcopal city. He was\nmounted on an ass. His purse, which was very dry at that moment, did not\npermit him any other equipage. The mayor of the town came to receive\nhim at the gate of the town, and watched him dismount from his ass,\nwith scandalized eyes. Some of the citizens were laughing around him.\n\"Monsieur the Mayor,\" said the Bishop, \"and Messieurs Citizens, I\nperceive that I shock you. You think it very arrogant in a poor priest\nto ride an animal which was used by Jesus Christ. I have done so from\nnecessity, I assure you, and not from vanity.\"\n\nIn the course of these trips he was kind and indulgent, and talked\nrather than preached. He never went far in search of his arguments and\nhis examples. He quoted to the inhabitants of one district the example\nof a neighboring district. In the cantons where they were harsh to the\npoor, he said: \"Look at the people of Briancon! They have conferred on\nthe poor, on widows and orphans, the right to have their meadows mown\nthree days in advance of every one else. They rebuild their houses for\nthem gratuitously when they are ruined. Therefore it is a country which\nis blessed by God. For a whole century, there has not been a single\nmurderer among them.\"\n\nIn villages which were greedy for profit and harvest, he said: \"Look at\nthe people of Embrun! If, at the harvest season, the father of a family\nhas his son away on service in the army, and his daughters at service in\nthe town, and if he is ill and incapacitated, the cure recommends him to\nthe prayers of the congregation; and on Sunday, after the mass, all the\ninhabitants of the village--men, women, and children--go to the poor\nman's field and do his harvesting for him, and carry his straw and his\ngrain to his granary.\" To families divided by questions of money and\ninheritance he said: \"Look at the mountaineers of Devolny, a country so\nwild that the nightingale is not heard there once in fifty years.\nWell, when the father of a family dies, the boys go off to seek their\nfortunes, leaving the property to the girls, so that they may find\nhusbands.\" To the cantons which had a taste for lawsuits, and where the\nfarmers ruined themselves in stamped paper, he said: \"Look at those good\npeasants in the valley of Queyras! There are three thousand souls of\nthem. Mon Dieu! it is like a little republic. Neither judge nor bailiff\nis known there. The mayor does everything. He allots the imposts,\ntaxes each person conscientiously, judges quarrels for nothing, divides\ninheritances without charge, pronounces sentences gratuitously; and he\nis obeyed, because he is a just man among simple men.\" To villages where\nhe found no schoolmaster, he quoted once more the people of Queyras: \"Do\nyou know how they manage?\" he said. \"Since a little country of a\ndozen or fifteen hearths cannot always support a teacher, they have\nschool-masters who are paid by the whole valley, who make the round\nof the villages, spending a week in this one, ten days in that, and\ninstruct them. These teachers go to the fairs. I have seen them there.\nThey are to be recognized by the quill pens which they wear in the cord\nof their hat. Those who teach reading only have one pen; those who teach\nreading and reckoning have two pens; those who teach reading, reckoning,\nand Latin have three pens. But what a disgrace to be ignorant! Do like\nthe people of Queyras!\"\n\nThus he discoursed gravely and paternally; in default of examples, he\ninvented parables, going directly to the point, with few phrases and\nmany images, which characteristic formed the real eloquence of Jesus\nChrist. And being convinced himself, he was persuasive.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV--WORKS CORRESPONDING TO WORDS\n\nHis conversation was gay and affable. He put himself on a level with the\ntwo old women who had passed their lives beside him. When he laughed,\nit was the laugh of a schoolboy. Madame Magloire liked to call him Your\nGrace [Votre Grandeur]. One day he rose from his arm-chair, and went\nto his library in search of a book. This book was on one of the upper\nshelves. As the bishop was rather short of stature, he could not\nreach it. \"Madame Magloire,\" said he, \"fetch me a chair. My greatness\n[grandeur] does not reach as far as that shelf.\"\n\nOne of his distant relatives, Madame la Comtesse de Lo, rarely allowed\nan opportunity to escape of enumerating, in his presence, what she\ndesignated as \"the expectations\" of her three sons. She had numerous\nrelatives, who were very old and near to death, and of whom her sons\nwere the natural heirs. The youngest of the three was to receive from a\ngrand-aunt a good hundred thousand livres of income; the second was the\nheir by entail to the title of the Duke, his uncle; the eldest was to\nsucceed to the peerage of his grandfather. The Bishop was accustomed to\nlisten in silence to these innocent and pardonable maternal boasts. On\none occasion, however, he appeared to be more thoughtful than usual,\nwhile Madame de Lo was relating once again the details of all these\ninheritances and all these \"expectations.\" She interrupted herself\nimpatiently: \"Mon Dieu, cousin! What are you thinking about?\" \"I am\nthinking,\" replied the Bishop, \"of a singular remark, which is to be\nfound, I believe, in St. Augustine,--'Place your hopes in the man from\nwhom you do not inherit.'\"\n\nAt another time, on receiving a notification of the decease of a\ngentleman of the country-side, wherein not only the dignities of the\ndead man, but also the feudal and noble qualifications of all his\nrelatives, spread over an entire page: \"What a stout back Death has!\"\nhe exclaimed. \"What a strange burden of titles is cheerfully imposed\non him, and how much wit must men have, in order thus to press the tomb\ninto the service of vanity!\"\n\nHe was gifted, on occasion, with a gentle raillery, which almost always\nconcealed a serious meaning. In the course of one Lent, a youthful vicar\ncame to D----, and preached in the cathedral. He was tolerably eloquent.\nThe subject of his sermon was charity. He urged the rich to give to the\npoor, in order to avoid hell, which he depicted in the most frightful\nmanner of which he was capable, and to win paradise, which he\nrepresented as charming and desirable. Among the audience there was\na wealthy retired merchant, who was somewhat of a usurer, named M.\nGeborand, who had amassed two millions in the manufacture of coarse\ncloth, serges, and woollen galloons. Never in his whole life had M.\nGeborand bestowed alms on any poor wretch. After the delivery of that\nsermon, it was observed that he gave a sou every Sunday to the poor old\nbeggar-women at the door of the cathedral. There were six of them to\nshare it. One day the Bishop caught sight of him in the act of bestowing\nthis charity, and said to his sister, with a smile, \"There is M.\nGeborand purchasing paradise for a sou.\"\n\nWhen it was a question of charity, he was not to be rebuffed even by\na refusal, and on such occasions he gave utterance to remarks which\ninduced reflection. Once he was begging for the poor in a drawing-room\nof the town; there was present the Marquis de Champtercier, a wealthy\nand avaricious old man, who contrived to be, at one and the same time,\nan ultra-royalist and an ultra-Voltairian. This variety of man has\nactually existed. When the Bishop came to him, he touched his arm, \"You\nmust give me something, M. le Marquis.\" The Marquis turned round and\nanswered dryly, \"I have poor people of my own, Monseigneur.\" \"Give them\nto me,\" replied the Bishop.\n\nOne day he preached the following sermon in the cathedral:--\n\n\n\"My very dear brethren, my good friends, there are thirteen hundred\nand twenty thousand peasants' dwellings in France which have but three\nopenings; eighteen hundred and seventeen thousand hovels which have but\ntwo openings, the door and one window; and three hundred and forty-six\nthousand cabins besides which have but one opening, the door. And this\narises from a thing which is called the tax on doors and windows. Just\nput poor families, old women and little children, in those buildings,\nand behold the fevers and maladies which result! Alas! God gives air to\nmen; the law sells it to them. I do not blame the law, but I bless God.\nIn the department of the Isere, in the Var, in the two departments\nof the Alpes, the Hautes, and the Basses, the peasants have not even\nwheelbarrows; they transport their manure on the backs of men; they have\nno candles, and they burn resinous sticks, and bits of rope dipped in\npitch. That is the state of affairs throughout the whole of the hilly\ncountry of Dauphine. They make bread for six months at one time; they\nbake it with dried cow-dung. In the winter they break this bread up with\nan axe, and they soak it for twenty-four hours, in order to render it\neatable. My brethren, have pity! behold the suffering on all sides of\nyou!\"\n\nBorn a Provencal, he easily familiarized himself with the dialect of the\nsouth. He said, \"En be! moussu, ses sage?\" as in lower Languedoc; \"Onte\nanaras passa?\" as in the Basses-Alpes; \"Puerte un bouen moutu embe un\nbouen fromage grase,\" as in upper Dauphine. This pleased the people\nextremely, and contributed not a little to win him access to all\nspirits. He was perfectly at home in the thatched cottage and in the\nmountains. He understood how to say the grandest things in the most\nvulgar of idioms. As he spoke all tongues, he entered into all hearts.\n\nMoreover, he was the same towards people of the world and towards\nthe lower classes. He condemned nothing in haste and without taking\ncircumstances into account. He said, \"Examine the road over which the\nfault has passed.\"\n\nBeing, as he described himself with a smile, an ex-sinner, he had none\nof the asperities of austerity, and he professed, with a good deal\nof distinctness, and without the frown of the ferociously virtuous, a\ndoctrine which may be summed up as follows:--\n\n\"Man has upon him his flesh, which is at once his burden and his\ntemptation. He drags it with him and yields to it. He must watch it,\ncheck it, repress it, and obey it only at the last extremity. There may\nbe some fault even in this obedience; but the fault thus committed is\nvenial; it is a fall, but a fall on the knees which may terminate in\nprayer.\n\n\"To be a saint is the exception; to be an upright man is the rule. Err,\nfall, sin if you will, but be upright.\n\n\"The least possible sin is the law of man. No sin at all is the dream\nof the angel. All which is terrestrial is subject to sin. Sin is a\ngravitation.\"\n\nWhen he saw everyone exclaiming very loudly, and growing angry very\nquickly, \"Oh! oh!\" he said, with a smile; \"to all appearance, this is\na great crime which all the world commits. These are hypocrisies\nwhich have taken fright, and are in haste to make protest and to put\nthemselves under shelter.\"\n\nHe was indulgent towards women and poor people, on whom the burden of\nhuman society rest. He said, \"The faults of women, of children, of the\nfeeble, the indigent, and the ignorant, are the fault of the husbands,\nthe fathers, the masters, the strong, the rich, and the wise.\"\n\nHe said, moreover, \"Teach those who are ignorant as many things as\npossible; society is culpable, in that it does not afford instruction\ngratis; it is responsible for the night which it produces. This soul\nis full of shadow; sin is therein committed. The guilty one is not the\nperson who has committed the sin, but the person who has created the\nshadow.\"\n\nIt will be perceived that he had a peculiar manner of his own of judging\nthings: I suspect that he obtained it from the Gospel.\n\nOne day he heard a criminal case, which was in preparation and on the\npoint of trial, discussed in a drawing-room. A wretched man, being at\nthe end of his resources, had coined counterfeit money, out of love for\na woman, and for the child which he had had by her. Counterfeiting was\nstill punishable with death at that epoch. The woman had been arrested\nin the act of passing the first false piece made by the man. She was\nheld, but there were no proofs except against her. She alone could\naccuse her lover, and destroy him by her confession. She denied; they\ninsisted. She persisted in her denial. Thereupon an idea occurred to\nthe attorney for the crown. He invented an infidelity on the part of\nthe lover, and succeeded, by means of fragments of letters cunningly\npresented, in persuading the unfortunate woman that she had a rival, and\nthat the man was deceiving her. Thereupon, exasperated by jealousy, she\ndenounced her lover, confessed all, proved all.\n\nThe man was ruined. He was shortly to be tried at Aix with his\naccomplice. They were relating the matter, and each one was expressing\nenthusiasm over the cleverness of the magistrate. By bringing jealousy\ninto play, he had caused the truth to burst forth in wrath, he had\neduced the justice of revenge. The Bishop listened to all this in\nsilence. When they had finished, he inquired,--\n\n\"Where are this man and woman to be tried?\"\n\n\"At the Court of Assizes.\"\n\nHe went on, \"And where will the advocate of the crown be tried?\"\n\nA tragic event occurred at D---- A man was condemned to death for\nmurder. He was a wretched fellow, not exactly educated, not exactly\nignorant, who had been a mountebank at fairs, and a writer for the\npublic. The town took a great interest in the trial. On the eve of the\nday fixed for the execution of the condemned man, the chaplain of the\nprison fell ill. A priest was needed to attend the criminal in his\nlast moments. They sent for the cure. It seems that he refused to come,\nsaying, \"That is no affair of mine. I have nothing to do with that\nunpleasant task, and with that mountebank: I, too, am ill; and besides,\nit is not my place.\" This reply was reported to the Bishop, who said,\n\"Monsieur le Cure is right: it is not his place; it is mine.\"\n\nHe went instantly to the prison, descended to the cell of the\n\"mountebank,\" called him by name, took him by the hand, and spoke to\nhim. He passed the entire day with him, forgetful of food and sleep,\npraying to God for the soul of the condemned man, and praying the\ncondemned man for his own. He told him the best truths, which are also\nthe most simple. He was father, brother, friend; he was bishop only to\nbless. He taught him everything, encouraged and consoled him. The man\nwas on the point of dying in despair. Death was an abyss to him. As he\nstood trembling on its mournful brink, he recoiled with horror. He\nwas not sufficiently ignorant to be absolutely indifferent. His\ncondemnation, which had been a profound shock, had, in a manner, broken\nthrough, here and there, that wall which separates us from the mystery\nof things, and which we call life. He gazed incessantly beyond this\nworld through these fatal breaches, and beheld only darkness. The Bishop\nmade him see light.\n\nOn the following day, when they came to fetch the unhappy wretch, the\nBishop was still there. He followed him, and exhibited himself to the\neyes of the crowd in his purple camail and with his episcopal cross upon\nhis neck, side by side with the criminal bound with cords.\n\nHe mounted the tumbril with him, he mounted the scaffold with him. The\nsufferer, who had been so gloomy and cast down on the preceding day, was\nradiant. He felt that his soul was reconciled, and he hoped in God. The\nBishop embraced him, and at the moment when the knife was about to fall,\nhe said to him: \"God raises from the dead him whom man slays; he whom\nhis brothers have rejected finds his Father once more. Pray, believe,\nenter into life: the Father is there.\" When he descended from the\nscaffold, there was something in his look which made the people draw\naside to let him pass. They did not know which was most worthy of\nadmiration, his pallor or his serenity. On his return to the humble\ndwelling, which he designated, with a smile, as his palace, he said to\nhis sister, \"I have just officiated pontifically.\"\n\nSince the most sublime things are often those which are the least\nunderstood, there were people in the town who said, when commenting on\nthis conduct of the Bishop, \"It is affectation.\"\n\nThis, however, was a remark which was confined to the drawing-rooms.\nThe populace, which perceives no jest in holy deeds, was touched, and\nadmired him.\n\nAs for the Bishop, it was a shock to him to have beheld the guillotine,\nand it was a long time before he recovered from it.\n\nIn fact, when the scaffold is there, all erected and prepared, it has\nsomething about it which produces hallucination. One may feel a certain\nindifference to the death penalty, one may refrain from pronouncing upon\nit, from saying yes or no, so long as one has not seen a guillotine with\none's own eyes: but if one encounters one of them, the shock is violent;\none is forced to decide, and to take part for or against. Some admire\nit, like de Maistre; others execrate it, like Beccaria. The guillotine\nis the concretion of the law; it is called vindicte; it is not neutral,\nand it does not permit you to remain neutral. He who sees it shivers\nwith the most mysterious of shivers. All social problems erect their\ninterrogation point around this chopping-knife. The scaffold is a\nvision. The scaffold is not a piece of carpentry; the scaffold is not\na machine; the scaffold is not an inert bit of mechanism constructed of\nwood, iron and cords.\n\nIt seems as though it were a being, possessed of I know not what sombre\ninitiative; one would say that this piece of carpenter's work saw, that\nthis machine heard, that this mechanism understood, that this wood,\nthis iron, and these cords were possessed of will. In the frightful\nmeditation into which its presence casts the soul the scaffold appears\nin terrible guise, and as though taking part in what is going on. The\nscaffold is the accomplice of the executioner; it devours, it eats\nflesh, it drinks blood; the scaffold is a sort of monster fabricated\nby the judge and the carpenter, a spectre which seems to live with a\nhorrible vitality composed of all the death which it has inflicted.\n\nTherefore, the impression was terrible and profound; on the day\nfollowing the execution, and on many succeeding days, the Bishop\nappeared to be crushed. The almost violent serenity of the funereal\nmoment had disappeared; the phantom of social justice tormented him. He,\nwho generally returned from all his deeds with a radiant satisfaction,\nseemed to be reproaching himself. At times he talked to himself, and\nstammered lugubrious monologues in a low voice. This is one which his\nsister overheard one evening and preserved: \"I did not think that it was\nso monstrous. It is wrong to become absorbed in the divine law to such a\ndegree as not to perceive human law. Death belongs to God alone. By what\nright do men touch that unknown thing?\"\n\nIn course of time these impressions weakened and probably vanished.\nNevertheless, it was observed that the Bishop thenceforth avoided\npassing the place of execution.\n\nM. Myriel could be summoned at any hour to the bedside of the sick and\ndying. He did not ignore the fact that therein lay his greatest duty and\nhis greatest labor. Widowed and orphaned families had no need to summon\nhim; he came of his own accord. He understood how to sit down and hold\nhis peace for long hours beside the man who had lost the wife of his\nlove, of the mother who had lost her child. As he knew the moment for\nsilence he knew also the moment for speech. Oh, admirable consoler! He\nsought not to efface sorrow by forgetfulness, but to magnify and dignify\nit by hope. He said:--\n\n\"Have a care of the manner in which you turn towards the dead. Think\nnot of that which perishes. Gaze steadily. You will perceive the living\nlight of your well-beloved dead in the depths of heaven.\" He knew that\nfaith is wholesome. He sought to counsel and calm the despairing man, by\npointing out to him the resigned man, and to transform the grief which\ngazes upon a grave by showing him the grief which fixes its gaze upon a\nstar.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V--MONSEIGNEUR BIENVENU MADE HIS CASSOCKS LAST TOO LONG\n\n\nThe private life of M. Myriel was filled with the same thoughts as his\npublic life. The voluntary poverty in which the Bishop of D---- lived,\nwould have been a solemn and charming sight for any one who could have\nviewed it close at hand.\n\nLike all old men, and like the majority of thinkers, he slept little.\nThis brief slumber was profound. In the morning he meditated for an\nhour, then he said his mass, either at the cathedral or in his own\nhouse. His mass said, he broke his fast on rye bread dipped in the milk\nof his own cows. Then he set to work.\n\nA Bishop is a very busy man: he must every day receive the secretary\nof the bishopric, who is generally a canon, and nearly every day his\nvicars-general. He has congregations to reprove, privileges to grant,\na whole ecclesiastical library to examine,--prayer-books, diocesan\ncatechisms, books of hours, etc.,--charges to write, sermons to\nauthorize, cures and mayors to reconcile, a clerical correspondence, an\nadministrative correspondence; on one side the State, on the other the\nHoly See; and a thousand matters of business.\n\nWhat time was left to him, after these thousand details of business, and\nhis offices and his breviary, he bestowed first on the necessitous,\nthe sick, and the afflicted; the time which was left to him from the\nafflicted, the sick, and the necessitous, he devoted to work. Sometimes\nhe dug in his garden; again, he read or wrote. He had but one word\nfor both these kinds of toil; he called them gardening. \"The mind is a\ngarden,\" said he.\n\nTowards mid-day, when the weather was fine, he went forth and took a\nstroll in the country or in town, often entering lowly dwellings. He\nwas seen walking alone, buried in his own thoughts, his eyes cast down,\nsupporting himself on his long cane, clad in his wadded purple garment\nof silk, which was very warm, wearing purple stockings inside his coarse\nshoes, and surmounted by a flat hat which allowed three golden tassels\nof large bullion to droop from its three points.\n\nIt was a perfect festival wherever he appeared. One would have said that\nhis presence had something warming and luminous about it. The children\nand the old people came out to the doorsteps for the Bishop as for the\nsun. He bestowed his blessing, and they blessed him. They pointed out\nhis house to any one who was in need of anything.\n\n[Illustration: The Comfortor  1b1-5-comfortor]\n\nHere and there he halted, accosted the little boys and girls, and smiled\nupon the mothers. He visited the poor so long as he had any money; when\nhe no longer had any, he visited the rich.\n\nAs he made his cassocks last a long while, and did not wish to have it\nnoticed, he never went out in the town without his wadded purple cloak.\nThis inconvenienced him somewhat in summer.\n\nOn his return, he dined. The dinner resembled his breakfast.\n\nAt half-past eight in the evening he supped with his sister, Madame\nMagloire standing behind them and serving them at table. Nothing could\nbe more frugal than this repast. If, however, the Bishop had one of his\ncures to supper, Madame Magloire took advantage of the opportunity to\nserve Monseigneur with some excellent fish from the lake, or with some\nfine game from the mountains. Every cure furnished the pretext for\na good meal: the Bishop did not interfere. With that exception, his\nordinary diet consisted only of vegetables boiled in water, and oil\nsoup. Thus it was said in the town, when the Bishop does not indulge in\nthe cheer of a cure, he indulges in the cheer of a trappist.\n\nAfter supper he conversed for half an hour with Mademoiselle Baptistine\nand Madame Magloire; then he retired to his own room and set to writing,\nsometimes on loose sheets, and again on the margin of some folio. He was\na man of letters and rather learned. He left behind him five or six\nvery curious manuscripts; among others, a dissertation on this verse in\nGenesis, In the beginning, the spirit of God floated upon the waters.\nWith this verse he compares three texts: the Arabic verse which says,\nThe winds of God blew; Flavius Josephus who says, A wind from above was\nprecipitated upon the earth; and finally, the Chaldaic paraphrase of\nOnkelos, which renders it, A wind coming from God blew upon the face of\nthe waters. In another dissertation, he examines the theological works\nof Hugo, Bishop of Ptolemais, great-grand-uncle to the writer of this\nbook, and establishes the fact, that to this bishop must be attributed\nthe divers little works published during the last century, under the\npseudonym of Barleycourt.\n\nSometimes, in the midst of his reading, no matter what the book might\nbe which he had in his hand, he would suddenly fall into a profound\nmeditation, whence he only emerged to write a few lines on the pages of\nthe volume itself. These lines have often no connection whatever with\nthe book which contains them. We now have under our eyes a note written\nby him on the margin of a quarto entitled Correspondence of Lord Germain\nwith Generals Clinton, Cornwallis, and the Admirals on the American\nstation. Versailles, Poincot, book-seller; and Paris, Pissot,\nbookseller, Quai des Augustins.\n\nHere is the note:--\n\n\"Oh, you who are!\n\n\"Ecclesiastes calls you the All-powerful; the Maccabees call you the\nCreator; the Epistle to the Ephesians calls you liberty; Baruch calls\nyou Immensity; the Psalms call you Wisdom and Truth; John calls you\nLight; the Books of Kings call you Lord; Exodus calls you Providence;\nLeviticus, Sanctity; Esdras, Justice; the creation calls you God; man\ncalls you Father; but Solomon calls you Compassion, and that is the most\nbeautiful of all your names.\"\n\nToward nine o'clock in the evening the two women retired and betook\nthemselves to their chambers on the first floor, leaving him alone until\nmorning on the ground floor.\n\nIt is necessary that we should, in this place, give an exact idea of the\ndwelling of the Bishop of D----\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI--WHO GUARDED HIS HOUSE FOR HIM\n\nThe house in which he lived consisted, as we have said, of a ground\nfloor, and one story above; three rooms on the ground floor, three\nchambers on the first, and an attic above. Behind the house was a\ngarden, a quarter of an acre in extent. The two women occupied the\nfirst floor; the Bishop was lodged below. The first room, opening on the\nstreet, served him as dining-room, the second was his bedroom, and the\nthird his oratory. There was no exit possible from this oratory, except\nby passing through the bedroom, nor from the bedroom, without passing\nthrough the dining-room. At the end of the suite, in the oratory, there\nwas a detached alcove with a bed, for use in cases of hospitality.\nThe Bishop offered this bed to country curates whom business or the\nrequirements of their parishes brought to D----\n\nThe pharmacy of the hospital, a small building which had been added\nto the house, and abutted on the garden, had been transformed into\na kitchen and cellar. In addition to this, there was in the garden a\nstable, which had formerly been the kitchen of the hospital, and in\nwhich the Bishop kept two cows. No matter what the quantity of milk they\ngave, he invariably sent half of it every morning to the sick people in\nthe hospital. \"I am paying my tithes,\" he said.\n\nHis bedroom was tolerably large, and rather difficult to warm in bad\nweather. As wood is extremely dear at D----, he hit upon the idea of\nhaving a compartment of boards constructed in the cow-shed. Here he\npassed his evenings during seasons of severe cold: he called it his\nwinter salon.\n\nIn this winter salon, as in the dining-room, there was no other\nfurniture than a square table in white wood, and four straw-seated\nchairs. In addition to this the dining-room was ornamented with an\nantique sideboard, painted pink, in water colors. Out of a similar\nsideboard, properly draped with white napery and imitation lace, the\nBishop had constructed the altar which decorated his oratory.\n\nHis wealthy penitents and the sainted women of D---- had more than once\nassessed themselves to raise the money for a new altar for Monseigneur's\noratory; on each occasion he had taken the money and had given it to\nthe poor. \"The most beautiful of altars,\" he said, \"is the soul of an\nunhappy creature consoled and thanking God.\"\n\nIn his oratory there were two straw prie-Dieu, and there was an\narm-chair, also in straw, in his bedroom. When, by chance, he received\nseven or eight persons at one time, the prefect, or the general, or the\nstaff of the regiment in garrison, or several pupils from the little\nseminary, the chairs had to be fetched from the winter salon in the\nstable, the prie-Dieu from the oratory, and the arm-chair from the\nbedroom: in this way as many as eleven chairs could be collected for the\nvisitors. A room was dismantled for each new guest.\n\nIt sometimes happened that there were twelve in the party; the Bishop\nthen relieved the embarrassment of the situation by standing in front\nof the chimney if it was winter, or by strolling in the garden if it was\nsummer.\n\nThere was still another chair in the detached alcove, but the straw was\nhalf gone from it, and it had but three legs, so that it was of service\nonly when propped against the wall. Mademoiselle Baptistine had also in\nher own room a very large easy-chair of wood, which had formerly been\ngilded, and which was covered with flowered pekin; but they had been\nobliged to hoist this bergere up to the first story through the window,\nas the staircase was too narrow; it could not, therefore, be reckoned\namong the possibilities in the way of furniture.\n\nMademoiselle Baptistine's ambition had been to be able to purchase a set\nof drawing-room furniture in yellow Utrecht velvet, stamped with a rose\npattern, and with mahogany in swan's neck style, with a sofa. But this\nwould have cost five hundred francs at least, and in view of the fact\nthat she had only been able to lay by forty-two francs and ten sous for\nthis purpose in the course of five years, she had ended by renouncing\nthe idea. However, who is there who has attained his ideal?\n\nNothing is more easy to present to the imagination than the Bishop's\nbedchamber. A glazed door opened on the garden; opposite this was the\nbed,--a hospital bed of iron, with a canopy of green serge; in the\nshadow of the bed, behind a curtain, were the utensils of the toilet,\nwhich still betrayed the elegant habits of the man of the world: there\nwere two doors, one near the chimney, opening into the oratory; the\nother near the bookcase, opening into the dining-room. The bookcase was\na large cupboard with glass doors filled with books; the chimney was of\nwood painted to represent marble, and habitually without fire. In the\nchimney stood a pair of firedogs of iron, ornamented above with two\ngarlanded vases, and flutings which had formerly been silvered\nwith silver leaf, which was a sort of episcopal luxury; above the\nchimney-piece hung a crucifix of copper, with the silver worn off, fixed\non a background of threadbare velvet in a wooden frame from which the\ngilding had fallen; near the glass door a large table with an inkstand,\nloaded with a confusion of papers and with huge volumes; before the\ntable an arm-chair of straw; in front of the bed a prie-Dieu, borrowed\nfrom the oratory.\n\nTwo portraits in oval frames were fastened to the wall on each side of\nthe bed. Small gilt inscriptions on the plain surface of the cloth at\nthe side of these figures indicated that the portraits represented,\none the Abbe of Chaliot, bishop of Saint Claude; the other, the Abbe\nTourteau, vicar-general of Agde, abbe of Grand-Champ, order of Citeaux,\ndiocese of Chartres. When the Bishop succeeded to this apartment, after\nthe hospital patients, he had found these portraits there, and had left\nthem. They were priests, and probably donors--two reasons for respecting\nthem. All that he knew about these two persons was, that they had\nbeen appointed by the king, the one to his bishopric, the other to his\nbenefice, on the same day, the 27th of April, 1785. Madame Magloire\nhaving taken the pictures down to dust, the Bishop had discovered these\nparticulars written in whitish ink on a little square of paper, yellowed\nby time, and attached to the back of the portrait of the Abbe of\nGrand-Champ with four wafers.\n\nAt his window he had an antique curtain of a coarse woollen stuff, which\nfinally became so old, that, in order to avoid the expense of a new one,\nMadame Magloire was forced to take a large seam in the very middle\nof it. This seam took the form of a cross. The Bishop often called\nattention to it: \"How delightful that is!\" he said.\n\nAll the rooms in the house, without exception, those on the ground\nfloor as well as those on the first floor, were white-washed, which is a\nfashion in barracks and hospitals.\n\nHowever, in their latter years, Madame Magloire discovered beneath the\npaper which had been washed over, paintings, ornamenting the apartment\nof Mademoiselle Baptistine, as we shall see further on. Before becoming\na hospital, this house had been the ancient parliament house of the\nBourgeois. Hence this decoration. The chambers were paved in red bricks,\nwhich were washed every week, with straw mats in front of all the beds.\nAltogether, this dwelling, which was attended to by the two women, was\nexquisitely clean from top to bottom. This was the sole luxury which the\nBishop permitted. He said, \"That takes nothing from the poor.\"\n\nIt must be confessed, however, that he still retained from his former\npossessions six silver knives and forks and a soup-ladle, which\nMadame Magloire contemplated every day with delight, as they glistened\nsplendidly upon the coarse linen cloth. And since we are now painting\nthe Bishop of D---- as he was in reality, we must add that he had said\nmore than once, \"I find it difficult to renounce eating from silver\ndishes.\"\n\nTo this silverware must be added two large candlesticks of massive\nsilver, which he had inherited from a great-aunt. These candlesticks\nheld two wax candles, and usually figured on the Bishop's chimney-piece.\nWhen he had any one to dinner, Madame Magloire lighted the two candles\nand set the candlesticks on the table.\n\nIn the Bishop's own chamber, at the head of his bed, there was a small\ncupboard, in which Madame Magloire locked up the six silver knives and\nforks and the big spoon every night. But it is necessary to add, that\nthe key was never removed.\n\nThe garden, which had been rather spoiled by the ugly buildings which\nwe have mentioned, was composed of four alleys in cross-form, radiating\nfrom a tank. Another walk made the circuit of the garden, and skirted\nthe white wall which enclosed it. These alleys left behind them four\nsquare plots rimmed with box. In three of these, Madame Magloire\ncultivated vegetables; in the fourth, the Bishop had planted some\nflowers; here and there stood a few fruit-trees. Madame Magloire had\nonce remarked, with a sort of gentle malice: \"Monseigneur, you who turn\neverything to account, have, nevertheless, one useless plot. It would be\nbetter to grow salads there than bouquets.\" \"Madame Magloire,\" retorted\nthe Bishop, \"you are mistaken. The beautiful is as useful as the\nuseful.\" He added after a pause, \"More so, perhaps.\"\n\nThis plot, consisting of three or four beds, occupied the Bishop\nalmost as much as did his books. He liked to pass an hour or two there,\ntrimming, hoeing, and making holes here and there in the earth, into\nwhich he dropped seeds. He was not as hostile to insects as a gardener\ncould have wished to see him. Moreover, he made no pretensions to\nbotany; he ignored groups and consistency; he made not the slightest\neffort to decide between Tournefort and the natural method; he took part\nneither with the buds against the cotyledons, nor with Jussieu against\nLinnaeus. He did not study plants; he loved flowers. He respected\nlearned men greatly; he respected the ignorant still more; and, without\never failing in these two respects, he watered his flower-beds every\nsummer evening with a tin watering-pot painted green.\n\nThe house had not a single door which could be locked. The door of the\ndining-room, which, as we have said, opened directly on the cathedral\nsquare, had formerly been ornamented with locks and bolts like the door\nof a prison. The Bishop had had all this ironwork removed, and this door\nwas never fastened, either by night or by day, with anything except the\nlatch. All that the first passerby had to do at any hour, was to give it\na push. At first, the two women had been very much tried by this door,\nwhich was never fastened, but Monsieur de D---- had said to them, \"Have\nbolts put on your rooms, if that will please you.\" They had ended by\nsharing his confidence, or by at least acting as though they shared it.\nMadame Magloire alone had frights from time to time. As for the Bishop,\nhis thought can be found explained, or at least indicated, in the three\nlines which he wrote on the margin of a Bible, \"This is the shade of\ndifference: the door of the physician should never be shut, the door of\nthe priest should always be open.\"\n\nOn another book, entitled Philosophy of the Medical Science, he had\nwritten this other note: \"Am not I a physician like them? I also have my\npatients, and then, too, I have some whom I call my unfortunates.\"\n\nAgain he wrote: \"Do not inquire the name of him who asks a shelter of\nyou. The very man who is embarrassed by his name is the one who needs\nshelter.\"\n\nIt chanced that a worthy cure, I know not whether it was the cure of\nCouloubroux or the cure of Pompierry, took it into his head to ask\nhim one day, probably at the instigation of Madame Magloire, whether\nMonsieur was sure that he was not committing an indiscretion, to a\ncertain extent, in leaving his door unfastened day and night, at the\nmercy of any one who should choose to enter, and whether, in short,\nhe did not fear lest some misfortune might occur in a house so little\nguarded. The Bishop touched his shoulder, with gentle gravity, and\nsaid to him, \"Nisi Dominus custodierit domum, in vanum vigilant qui\ncustodiunt eam,\" Unless the Lord guard the house, in vain do they watch\nwho guard it.\n\nThen he spoke of something else.\n\nHe was fond of saying, \"There is a bravery of the priest as well as\nthe bravery of a colonel of dragoons,--only,\" he added, \"ours must be\ntranquil.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII--CRAVATTE\n\nIt is here that a fact falls naturally into place, which we must not\nomit, because it is one of the sort which show us best what sort of a\nman the Bishop of D---- was.\n\nAfter the destruction of the band of Gaspard Bes, who had infested the\ngorges of Ollioules, one of his lieutenants, Cravatte, took refuge in\nthe mountains. He concealed himself for some time with his bandits, the\nremnant of Gaspard Bes's troop, in the county of Nice; then he made his\nway to Piedmont, and suddenly reappeared in France, in the vicinity\nof Barcelonette. He was first seen at Jauziers, then at Tuiles. He hid\nhimself in the caverns of the Joug-de-l'Aigle, and thence he descended\ntowards the hamlets and villages through the ravines of Ubaye and\nUbayette.\n\nHe even pushed as far as Embrun, entered the cathedral one night,\nand despoiled the sacristy. His highway robberies laid waste the\ncountry-side. The gendarmes were set on his track, but in vain. He\nalways escaped; sometimes he resisted by main force. He was a bold\nwretch. In the midst of all this terror the Bishop arrived. He was\nmaking his circuit to Chastelar. The mayor came to meet him, and urged\nhim to retrace his steps. Cravatte was in possession of the mountains\nas far as Arche, and beyond; there was danger even with an escort; it\nmerely exposed three or four unfortunate gendarmes to no purpose.\n\n\"Therefore,\" said the Bishop, \"I intend to go without escort.\"\n\n\"You do not really mean that, Monseigneur!\" exclaimed the mayor.\n\n\"I do mean it so thoroughly that I absolutely refuse any gendarmes, and\nshall set out in an hour.\"\n\n\"Set out?\"\n\n\"Set out.\"\n\n\"Alone?\"\n\n\"Alone.\"\n\n\"Monseigneur, you will not do that!\"\n\n\"There exists yonder in the mountains,\" said the Bishop, \"a tiny\ncommunity no bigger than that, which I have not seen for three years.\nThey are my good friends, those gentle and honest shepherds. They own\none goat out of every thirty that they tend. They make very pretty\nwoollen cords of various colors, and they play the mountain airs on\nlittle flutes with six holes. They need to be told of the good God now\nand then. What would they say to a bishop who was afraid? What would\nthey say if I did not go?\"\n\n\"But the brigands, Monseigneur?\"\n\n\"Hold,\" said the Bishop, \"I must think of that. You are right. I may\nmeet them. They, too, need to be told of the good God.\"\n\n\"But, Monseigneur, there is a band of them! A flock of wolves!\"\n\n\"Monsieur le maire, it may be that it is of this very flock of wolves\nthat Jesus has constituted me the shepherd. Who knows the ways of\nProvidence?\"\n\n\"They will rob you, Monseigneur.\"\n\n\"I have nothing.\"\n\n\"They will kill you.\"\n\n\"An old goodman of a priest, who passes along mumbling his prayers? Bah!\nTo what purpose?\"\n\n\"Oh, mon Dieu! what if you should meet them!\"\n\n\"I should beg alms of them for my poor.\"\n\n\"Do not go, Monseigneur. In the name of Heaven! You are risking your\nlife!\"\n\n\"Monsieur le maire,\" said the Bishop, \"is that really all? I am not in\nthe world to guard my own life, but to guard souls.\"\n\nThey had to allow him to do as he pleased. He set out, accompanied only\nby a child who offered to serve as a guide. His obstinacy was bruited\nabout the country-side, and caused great consternation.\n\nHe would take neither his sister nor Madame Magloire. He traversed the\nmountain on mule-back, encountered no one, and arrived safe and sound\nat the residence of his \"good friends,\" the shepherds. He remained\nthere for a fortnight, preaching, administering the sacrament, teaching,\nexhorting. When the time of his departure approached, he resolved to\nchant a Te Deum pontifically. He mentioned it to the cure. But what was\nto be done? There were no episcopal ornaments. They could only place at\nhis disposal a wretched village sacristy, with a few ancient chasubles\nof threadbare damask adorned with imitation lace.\n\n\"Bah!\" said the Bishop. \"Let us announce our Te Deum from the pulpit,\nnevertheless, Monsieur le Cure. Things will arrange themselves.\"\n\nThey instituted a search in the churches of the neighborhood. All the\nmagnificence of these humble parishes combined would not have sufficed\nto clothe the chorister of a cathedral properly.\n\nWhile they were thus embarrassed, a large chest was brought and\ndeposited in the presbytery for the Bishop, by two unknown horsemen, who\ndeparted on the instant. The chest was opened; it contained a cope of\ncloth of gold, a mitre ornamented with diamonds, an archbishop's cross,\na magnificent crosier,--all the pontifical vestments which had been\nstolen a month previously from the treasury of Notre Dame d'Embrun. In\nthe chest was a paper, on which these words were written, \"From Cravatte\nto Monseigneur Bienvenu.\"\n\n\"Did not I say that things would come right of themselves?\" said the\nBishop. Then he added, with a smile, \"To him who contents himself with\nthe surplice of a curate, God sends the cope of an archbishop.\"\n\n\"Monseigneur,\" murmured the cure, throwing back his head with a smile.\n\"God--or the Devil.\"\n\nThe Bishop looked steadily at the cure, and repeated with authority,\n\"God!\"\n\nWhen he returned to Chastelar, the people came out to stare at him as at\na curiosity, all along the road. At the priest's house in Chastelar he\nrejoined Mademoiselle Baptistine and Madame Magloire, who were waiting\nfor him, and he said to his sister: \"Well! was I in the right? The poor\npriest went to his poor mountaineers with empty hands, and he returns\nfrom them with his hands full. I set out bearing only my faith in God; I\nhave brought back the treasure of a cathedral.\"\n\nThat evening, before he went to bed, he said again: \"Let us never fear\nrobbers nor murderers. Those are dangers from without, petty dangers.\nLet us fear ourselves. Prejudices are the real robbers; vices are the\nreal murderers. The great dangers lie within ourselves. What matters it\nwhat threatens our head or our purse! Let us think only of that which\nthreatens our soul.\"\n\nThen, turning to his sister: \"Sister, never a precaution on the part\nof the priest, against his fellow-man. That which his fellow does, God\npermits. Let us confine ourselves to prayer, when we think that a danger\nis approaching us. Let us pray, not for ourselves, but that our brother\nmay not fall into sin on our account.\"\n\nHowever, such incidents were rare in his life. We relate those of which\nwe know; but generally he passed his life in doing the same things at\nthe same moment. One month of his year resembled one hour of his day.\n\nAs to what became of \"the treasure\" of the cathedral of Embrun, we\nshould be embarrassed by any inquiry in that direction. It consisted of\nvery handsome things, very tempting things, and things which were very\nwell adapted to be stolen for the benefit of the unfortunate. Stolen\nthey had already been elsewhere. Half of the adventure was completed; it\nonly remained to impart a new direction to the theft, and to cause it\nto take a short trip in the direction of the poor. However, we make no\nassertions on this point. Only, a rather obscure note was found among\nthe Bishop's papers, which may bear some relation to this matter, and\nwhich is couched in these terms, \"The question is, to decide whether\nthis should be turned over to the cathedral or to the hospital.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII--PHILOSOPHY AFTER DRINKING\n\nThe senator above mentioned was a clever man, who had made his own way,\nheedless of those things which present obstacles, and which are called\nconscience, sworn faith, justice, duty: he had marched straight to his\ngoal, without once flinching in the line of his advancement and his\ninterest. He was an old attorney, softened by success; not a bad man by\nany means, who rendered all the small services in his power to his sons,\nhis sons-in-law, his relations, and even to his friends, having wisely\nseized upon, in life, good sides, good opportunities, good windfalls.\nEverything else seemed to him very stupid. He was intelligent, and just\nsufficiently educated to think himself a disciple of Epicurus; while he\nwas, in reality, only a product of Pigault-Lebrun. He laughed willingly\nand pleasantly over infinite and eternal things, and at the \"Crotchets\nof that good old fellow the Bishop.\" He even sometimes laughed at him\nwith an amiable authority in the presence of M. Myriel himself, who\nlistened to him.\n\nOn some semi-official occasion or other, I do not recollect what,\nCount*** [this senator] and M. Myriel were to dine with the prefect.\nAt dessert, the senator, who was slightly exhilarated, though still\nperfectly dignified, exclaimed:--\n\n\"Egad, Bishop, let's have a discussion. It is hard for a senator and a\nbishop to look at each other without winking. We are two augurs. I am\ngoing to make a confession to you. I have a philosophy of my own.\"\n\n\"And you are right,\" replied the Bishop. \"As one makes one's philosophy,\nso one lies on it. You are on the bed of purple, senator.\"\n\nThe senator was encouraged, and went on:--\n\n\"Let us be good fellows.\"\n\n\"Good devils even,\" said the Bishop.\n\n\"I declare to you,\" continued the senator, \"that the Marquis d'Argens,\nPyrrhon, Hobbes, and M. Naigeon are no rascals. I have all the\nphilosophers in my library gilded on the edges.\"\n\n\"Like yourself, Count,\" interposed the Bishop.\n\nThe senator resumed:--\n\n\"I hate Diderot; he is an ideologist, a declaimer, and a revolutionist,\na believer in God at bottom, and more bigoted than Voltaire. Voltaire\nmade sport of Needham, and he was wrong, for Needham's eels prove that\nGod is useless. A drop of vinegar in a spoonful of flour paste supplies\nthe fiat lux. Suppose the drop to be larger and the spoonful bigger;\nyou have the world. Man is the eel. Then what is the good of the Eternal\nFather? The Jehovah hypothesis tires me, Bishop. It is good for nothing\nbut to produce shallow people, whose reasoning is hollow. Down with that\ngreat All, which torments me! Hurrah for Zero which leaves me in peace!\nBetween you and me, and in order to empty my sack, and make confession\nto my pastor, as it behooves me to do, I will admit to you that I\nhave good sense. I am not enthusiastic over your Jesus, who preaches\nrenunciation and sacrifice to the last extremity. 'Tis the counsel of an\navaricious man to beggars. Renunciation; why? Sacrifice; to what end?\nI do not see one wolf immolating himself for the happiness of another\nwolf. Let us stick to nature, then. We are at the top; let us have a\nsuperior philosophy. What is the advantage of being at the top, if\none sees no further than the end of other people's noses? Let us live\nmerrily. Life is all. That man has another future elsewhere, on high,\nbelow, anywhere, I don't believe; not one single word of it. Ah!\nsacrifice and renunciation are recommended to me; I must take heed to\neverything I do; I must cudgel my brains over good and evil, over the\njust and the unjust, over the fas and the nefas. Why? Because I shall\nhave to render an account of my actions. When? After death. What a fine\ndream! After my death it will be a very clever person who can catch me.\nHave a handful of dust seized by a shadow-hand, if you can. Let us tell\nthe truth, we who are initiated, and who have raised the veil of Isis:\nthere is no such thing as either good or evil; there is vegetation.\nLet us seek the real. Let us get to the bottom of it. Let us go into it\nthoroughly. What the deuce! let us go to the bottom of it! We must scent\nout the truth; dig in the earth for it, and seize it. Then it gives you\nexquisite joys. Then you grow strong, and you laugh. I am square on the\nbottom, I am. Immortality, Bishop, is a chance, a waiting for dead men's\nshoes. Ah! what a charming promise! trust to it, if you like! What a\nfine lot Adam has! We are souls, and we shall be angels, with blue wings\non our shoulder-blades. Do come to my assistance: is it not Tertullian\nwho says that the blessed shall travel from star to star? Very well. We\nshall be the grasshoppers of the stars. And then, besides, we shall\nsee God. Ta, ta, ta! What twaddle all these paradises are! God is a\nnonsensical monster. I would not say that in the Moniteur, egad! but I\nmay whisper it among friends. Inter pocula. To sacrifice the world to\nparadise is to let slip the prey for the shadow. Be the dupe of the\ninfinite! I'm not such a fool. I am a nought. I call myself Monsieur le\nComte Nought, senator. Did I exist before my birth? No. Shall I exist\nafter death? No. What am I? A little dust collected in an organism. What\nam I to do on this earth? The choice rests with me: suffer or enjoy.\nWhither will suffering lead me? To nothingness; but I shall have\nsuffered. Whither will enjoyment lead me? To nothingness; but I shall\nhave enjoyed myself. My choice is made. One must eat or be eaten. I\nshall eat. It is better to be the tooth than the grass. Such is my\nwisdom. After which, go whither I push thee, the grave-digger is there;\nthe Pantheon for some of us: all falls into the great hole. End. Finis.\nTotal liquidation. This is the vanishing-point. Death is death, believe\nme. I laugh at the idea of there being any one who has anything to tell\nme on that subject. Fables of nurses; bugaboo for children; Jehovah for\nmen. No; our to-morrow is the night. Beyond the tomb there is nothing\nbut equal nothingness. You have been Sardanapalus, you have been Vincent\nde Paul--it makes no difference. That is the truth. Then live your life,\nabove all things. Make use of your _I_ while you have it. In truth,\nBishop, I tell you that I have a philosophy of my own, and I have my\nphilosophers. I don't let myself be taken in with that nonsense.\nOf course, there must be something for those who are down,--for the\nbarefooted beggars, knife-grinders, and miserable wretches. Legends,\nchimeras, the soul, immortality, paradise, the stars, are provided for\nthem to swallow. They gobble it down. They spread it on their dry bread.\nHe who has nothing else has the good. God. That is the least he can\nhave. I oppose no objection to that; but I reserve Monsieur Naigeon for\nmyself. The good God is good for the populace.\"\n\nThe Bishop clapped his hands.\n\n\"That's talking!\" he exclaimed. \"What an excellent and really marvellous\nthing is this materialism! Not every one who wants it can have it. Ah!\nwhen one does have it, one is no longer a dupe, one does not stupidly\nallow one's self to be exiled like Cato, nor stoned like Stephen, nor\nburned alive like Jeanne d'Arc. Those who have succeeded in procuring\nthis admirable materialism have the joy of feeling themselves\nirresponsible, and of thinking that they can devour everything without\nuneasiness,--places, sinecures, dignities, power, whether well or\nill acquired, lucrative recantations, useful treacheries, savory\ncapitulations of conscience,--and that they shall enter the tomb with\ntheir digestion accomplished. How agreeable that is! I do not say that\nwith reference to you, senator. Nevertheless, it is impossible for me\nto refrain from congratulating you. You great lords have, so you say, a\nphilosophy of your own, and for yourselves, which is exquisite, refined,\naccessible to the rich alone, good for all sauces, and which seasons\nthe voluptuousness of life admirably. This philosophy has been\nextracted from the depths, and unearthed by special seekers. But you are\ngood-natured princes, and you do not think it a bad thing that belief in\nthe good God should constitute the philosophy of the people, very much\nas the goose stuffed with chestnuts is the truffled turkey of the poor.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX--THE BROTHER AS DEPICTED BY THE SISTER\n\nIn order to furnish an idea of the private establishment of the\nBishop of D----, and of the manner in which those two sainted women\nsubordinated their actions, their thoughts, their feminine instincts\neven, which are easily alarmed, to the habits and purposes of the\nBishop, without his even taking the trouble of speaking in order to\nexplain them, we cannot do better than transcribe in this place a letter\nfrom Mademoiselle Baptistine to Madame the Vicomtess de Boischevron, the\nfriend of her childhood. This letter is in our possession.\n\n\n                                        D----, Dec. 16, 18--.\nMY GOOD MADAM: Not a day passes without our speaking of you. It is our\nestablished custom; but there is another reason besides. Just imagine,\nwhile washing and dusting the ceilings and walls, Madam Magloire has\nmade some discoveries; now our two chambers hung with antique paper\nwhitewashed over, would not discredit a chateau in the style of yours.\nMadam Magloire has pulled off all the paper. There were things beneath.\nMy drawing-room, which contains no furniture, and which we use for\nspreading out the linen after washing, is fifteen feet in height,\neighteen square, with a ceiling which was formerly painted and gilded,\nand with beams, as in yours. This was covered with a cloth while this\nwas the hospital. And the woodwork was of the era of our grandmothers.\nBut my room is the one you ought to see. Madam Magloire has discovered,\nunder at least ten thicknesses of paper pasted on top, some paintings,\nwhich without being good are very tolerable. The subject is Telemachus\nbeing knighted by Minerva in some gardens, the name of which escapes\nme. In short, where the Roman ladies repaired on one single night. What\nshall I say to you? I have Romans, and Roman ladies [here occurs an\nillegible word], and the whole train. Madam Magloire has cleaned it all\noff; this summer she is going to have some small injuries repaired, and\nthe whole revarnished, and my chamber will be a regular museum. She has\nalso found in a corner of the attic two wooden pier-tables of ancient\nfashion. They asked us two crowns of six francs each to regild them, but\nit is much better to give the money to the poor; and they are very ugly\nbesides, and I should much prefer a round table of mahogany.\n\nI am always very happy. My brother is so good. He gives all he has to\nthe poor and sick. We are very much cramped. The country is trying in\nthe winter, and we really must do something for those who are in need.\nWe are almost comfortably lighted and warmed. You see that these are\ngreat treats.\n\nMy brother has ways of his own. When he talks, he says that a bishop\nought to be so. Just imagine! the door of our house is never fastened.\nWhoever chooses to enter finds himself at once in my brother's room. He\nfears nothing, even at night. That is his sort of bravery, he says.\n\nHe does not wish me or Madame Magloire feel any fear for him. He exposes\nhimself to all sorts of dangers, and he does not like to have us even\nseem to notice it. One must know how to understand him.\n\nHe goes out in the rain, he walks in the water, he travels in winter. He\nfears neither suspicious roads nor dangerous encounters, nor night.\n\nLast year he went quite alone into a country of robbers. He would\nnot take us. He was absent for a fortnight. On his return nothing had\nhappened to him; he was thought to be dead, but was perfectly well, and\nsaid, \"This is the way I have been robbed!\" And then he opened a trunk\nfull of jewels, all the jewels of the cathedral of Embrun, which the\nthieves had given him.\n\nWhen he returned on that occasion, I could not refrain from scolding him\na little, taking care, however, not to speak except when the carriage\nwas making a noise, so that no one might hear me.\n\nAt first I used to say to myself, \"There are no dangers which will stop\nhim; he is terrible.\" Now I have ended by getting used to it. I make a\nsign to Madam Magloire that she is not to oppose him. He risks himself\nas he sees fit. I carry off Madam Magloire, I enter my chamber, I pray\nfor him and fall asleep. I am at ease, because I know that if anything\nwere to happen to him, it would be the end of me. I should go to the\ngood God with my brother and my bishop. It has cost Madam Magloire\nmore trouble than it did me to accustom herself to what she terms his\nimprudences. But now the habit has been acquired. We pray together, we\ntremble together, and we fall asleep. If the devil were to enter this\nhouse, he would be allowed to do so. After all, what is there for us\nto fear in this house? There is always some one with us who is stronger\nthan we. The devil may pass through it, but the good God dwells here.\n\nThis suffices me. My brother has no longer any need of saying a word to\nme. I understand him without his speaking, and we abandon ourselves to\nthe care of Providence. That is the way one has to do with a man who\npossesses grandeur of soul.\n\nI have interrogated my brother with regard to the information which you\ndesire on the subject of the Faux family. You are aware that he knows\neverything, and that he has memories, because he is still a very\ngood royalist. They really are a very ancient Norman family of the\ngeneralship of Caen. Five hundred years ago there was a Raoul de Faux, a\nJean de Faux, and a Thomas de Faux, who were gentlemen, and one of whom\nwas a seigneur de Rochefort. The last was Guy-Etienne-Alexandre, and was\ncommander of a regiment, and something in the light horse of Bretagne.\nHis daughter, Marie-Louise, married Adrien-Charles de Gramont, son of\nthe Duke Louis de Gramont, peer of France, colonel of the French guards,\nand lieutenant-general of the army. It is written Faux, Fauq, and\nFaoucq.\n\nGood Madame, recommend us to the prayers of your sainted relative,\nMonsieur the Cardinal. As for your dear Sylvanie, she has done well in\nnot wasting the few moments which she passes with you in writing to me.\nShe is well, works as you would wish, and loves me.\n\nThat is all that I desire. The souvenir which she sent through you\nreached me safely, and it makes me very happy. My health is not so very\nbad, and yet I grow thinner every day. Farewell; my paper is at an end,\nand this forces me to leave you. A thousand good wishes.\n\nBAPTISTINE.\n\nP.S. Your grand nephew is charming. Do you know that he will soon be\nfive years old? Yesterday he saw some one riding by on horseback who\nhad on knee-caps, and he said, \"What has he got on his knees?\" He is a\ncharming child! His little brother is dragging an old broom about the\nroom, like a carriage, and saying, \"Hu!\"\n\n\nAs will be perceived from this letter, these two women understood how to\nmould themselves to the Bishop's ways with that special feminine genius\nwhich comprehends the man better than he comprehends himself. The Bishop\nof D----, in spite of the gentle and candid air which never deserted\nhim, sometimes did things that were grand, bold, and magnificent,\nwithout seeming to have even a suspicion of the fact. They trembled, but\nthey let him alone. Sometimes Madame Magloire essayed a remonstrance in\nadvance, but never at the time, nor afterwards. They never interfered\nwith him by so much as a word or sign, in any action once entered upon.\nAt certain moments, without his having occasion to mention it, when he\nwas not even conscious of it himself in all probability, so perfect was\nhis simplicity, they vaguely felt that he was acting as a bishop; then\nthey were nothing more than two shadows in the house. They served him\npassively; and if obedience consisted in disappearing, they disappeared.\nThey understood, with an admirable delicacy of instinct, that certain\ncares may be put under constraint. Thus, even when believing him to be\nin peril, they understood, I will not say his thought, but his nature,\nto such a degree that they no longer watched over him. They confided him\nto God.\n\nMoreover, Baptistine said, as we have just read, that her brother's end\nwould prove her own. Madame Magloire did not say this, but she knew it.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X--THE BISHOP IN THE PRESENCE OF AN UNKNOWN LIGHT\n\nAt an epoch a little later than the date of the letter cited in the\npreceding pages, he did a thing which, if the whole town was to be\nbelieved, was even more hazardous than his trip across the mountains\ninfested with bandits.\n\nIn the country near D---- a man lived quite alone. This man, we will\nstate at once, was a former member of the Convention. His name was G----\n\nMember of the Convention, G---- was mentioned with a sort of horror in\nthe little world of D---- A member of the Convention--can you imagine\nsuch a thing? That existed from the time when people called each other\nthou, and when they said \"citizen.\" This man was almost a monster.\nHe had not voted for the death of the king, but almost. He was a\nquasi-regicide. He had been a terrible man. How did it happen that such\na man had not been brought before a provost's court, on the return of\nthe legitimate princes? They need not have cut off his head, if you\nplease; clemency must be exercised, agreed; but a good banishment for\nlife. An example, in short, etc. Besides, he was an atheist, like all\nthe rest of those people. Gossip of the geese about the vulture.\n\nWas G---- a vulture after all? Yes; if he were to be judged by the\nelement of ferocity in this solitude of his. As he had not voted for the\ndeath of the king, he had not been included in the decrees of exile, and\nhad been able to remain in France.\n\nHe dwelt at a distance of three-quarters of an hour from the city, far\nfrom any hamlet, far from any road, in some hidden turn of a very wild\nvalley, no one knew exactly where. He had there, it was said, a sort\nof field, a hole, a lair. There were no neighbors, not even passers-by.\nSince he had dwelt in that valley, the path which led thither had\ndisappeared under a growth of grass. The locality was spoken of as\nthough it had been the dwelling of a hangman.\n\nNevertheless, the Bishop meditated on the subject, and from time to time\nhe gazed at the horizon at a point where a clump of trees marked the\nvalley of the former member of the Convention, and he said, \"There is a\nsoul yonder which is lonely.\"\n\nAnd he added, deep in his own mind, \"I owe him a visit.\"\n\nBut, let us avow it, this idea, which seemed natural at the first blush,\nappeared to him after a moment's reflection, as strange, impossible, and\nalmost repulsive. For, at bottom, he shared the general impression, and\nthe old member of the Convention inspired him, without his being clearly\nconscious of the fact himself, with that sentiment which borders on\nhate, and which is so well expressed by the word estrangement.\n\nStill, should the scab of the sheep cause the shepherd to recoil? No.\nBut what a sheep!\n\nThe good Bishop was perplexed. Sometimes he set out in that direction;\nthen he returned.\n\nFinally, the rumor one day spread through the town that a sort of young\nshepherd, who served the member of the Convention in his hovel, had come\nin quest of a doctor; that the old wretch was dying, that paralysis was\ngaining on him, and that he would not live over night.--\"Thank God!\"\nsome added.\n\nThe Bishop took his staff, put on his cloak, on account of his too\nthreadbare cassock, as we have mentioned, and because of the evening\nbreeze which was sure to rise soon, and set out.\n\nThe sun was setting, and had almost touched the horizon when the Bishop\narrived at the excommunicated spot. With a certain beating of the heart,\nhe recognized the fact that he was near the lair. He strode over a\nditch, leaped a hedge, made his way through a fence of dead boughs,\nentered a neglected paddock, took a few steps with a good deal of\nboldness, and suddenly, at the extremity of the waste land, and behind\nlofty brambles, he caught sight of the cavern.\n\nIt was a very low hut, poor, small, and clean, with a vine nailed\nagainst the outside.\n\nNear the door, in an old wheel-chair, the arm-chair of the peasants,\nthere was a white-haired man, smiling at the sun.\n\nNear the seated man stood a young boy, the shepherd lad. He was offering\nthe old man a jar of milk.\n\nWhile the Bishop was watching him, the old man spoke: \"Thank you,\" he\nsaid, \"I need nothing.\" And his smile quitted the sun to rest upon the\nchild.\n\nThe Bishop stepped forward. At the sound which he made in walking, the\nold man turned his head, and his face expressed the sum total of the\nsurprise which a man can still feel after a long life.\n\n\"This is the first time since I have been here,\" said he, \"that any one\nhas entered here. Who are you, sir?\"\n\nThe Bishop answered:--\n\n\"My name is Bienvenu Myriel.\"\n\n\"Bienvenu Myriel? I have heard that name. Are you the man whom the\npeople call Monseigneur Welcome?\"\n\n\"I am.\"\n\nThe old man resumed with a half-smile\n\n\"In that case, you are my bishop?\"\n\n\"Something of that sort.\"\n\n\"Enter, sir.\"\n\nThe member of the Convention extended his hand to the Bishop, but the\nBishop did not take it. The Bishop confined himself to the remark:--\n\n\"I am pleased to see that I have been misinformed. You certainly do not\nseem to me to be ill.\"\n\n\"Monsieur,\" replied the old man, \"I am going to recover.\"\n\nHe paused, and then said:--\n\n\"I shall die three hours hence.\"\n\nThen he continued:--\n\n\"I am something of a doctor; I know in what fashion the last hour draws\non. Yesterday, only my feet were cold; to-day, the chill has ascended to\nmy knees; now I feel it mounting to my waist; when it reaches the heart,\nI shall stop. The sun is beautiful, is it not? I had myself wheeled\nout here to take a last look at things. You can talk to me; it does not\nfatigue me. You have done well to come and look at a man who is on\nthe point of death. It is well that there should be witnesses at that\nmoment. One has one's caprices; I should have liked to last until the\ndawn, but I know that I shall hardly live three hours. It will be night\nthen. What does it matter, after all? Dying is a simple affair. One has\nno need of the light for that. So be it. I shall die by starlight.\"\n\nThe old man turned to the shepherd lad:--\n\n\"Go to thy bed; thou wert awake all last night; thou art tired.\"\n\nThe child entered the hut.\n\nThe old man followed him with his eyes, and added, as though speaking to\nhimself:--\n\n\"I shall die while he sleeps. The two slumbers may be good neighbors.\"\n\nThe Bishop was not touched as it seems that he should have been. He\ndid not think he discerned God in this manner of dying; let us say the\nwhole, for these petty contradictions of great hearts must be indicated\nlike the rest: he, who on occasion, was so fond of laughing at \"His\nGrace,\" was rather shocked at not being addressed as Monseigneur, and he\nwas almost tempted to retort \"citizen.\" He was assailed by a fancy for\npeevish familiarity, common enough to doctors and priests, but which\nwas not habitual with him. This man, after all, this member of the\nConvention, this representative of the people, had been one of the\npowerful ones of the earth; for the first time in his life, probably,\nthe Bishop felt in a mood to be severe.\n\nMeanwhile, the member of the Convention had been surveying him with a\nmodest cordiality, in which one could have distinguished, possibly, that\nhumility which is so fitting when one is on the verge of returning to\ndust.\n\nThe Bishop, on his side, although he generally restrained his curiosity,\nwhich, in his opinion, bordered on a fault, could not refrain from\nexamining the member of the Convention with an attention which, as it\ndid not have its course in sympathy, would have served his conscience as\na matter of reproach, in connection with any other man. A member of the\nConvention produced on him somewhat the effect of being outside the pale\nof the law, even of the law of charity. G----, calm, his body almost\nupright, his voice vibrating, was one of those octogenarians who form\nthe subject of astonishment to the physiologist. The Revolution had\nmany of these men, proportioned to the epoch. In this old man one was\nconscious of a man put to the proof. Though so near to his end, he\npreserved all the gestures of health. In his clear glance, in his firm\ntone, in the robust movement of his shoulders, there was something\ncalculated to disconcert death. Azrael, the Mohammedan angel of the\nsepulchre, would have turned back, and thought that he had mistaken\nthe door. G---- seemed to be dying because he willed it so. There was\nfreedom in his agony. His legs alone were motionless. It was there that\nthe shadows held him fast. His feet were cold and dead, but his head\nsurvived with all the power of life, and seemed full of light. G----,\nat this solemn moment, resembled the king in that tale of the Orient who\nwas flesh above and marble below.\n\nThere was a stone there. The Bishop sat down. The exordium was abrupt.\n\n\"I congratulate you,\" said he, in the tone which one uses for a\nreprimand. \"You did not vote for the death of the king, after all.\"\n\nThe old member of the Convention did not appear to notice the bitter\nmeaning underlying the words \"after all.\" He replied. The smile had\nquite disappeared from his face.\n\n\"Do not congratulate me too much, sir. I did vote for the death of the\ntyrant.\"\n\nIt was the tone of austerity answering the tone of severity.\n\n\"What do you mean to say?\" resumed the Bishop.\n\n\"I mean to say that man has a tyrant,--ignorance. I voted for the death\nof that tyrant. That tyrant engendered royalty, which is authority\nfalsely understood, while science is authority rightly understood. Man\nshould be governed only by science.\"\n\n\"And conscience,\" added the Bishop.\n\n\"It is the same thing. Conscience is the quantity of innate science\nwhich we have within us.\"\n\nMonseigneur Bienvenu listened in some astonishment to this language,\nwhich was very new to him.\n\nThe member of the Convention resumed:--\n\n\"So far as Louis XVI. was concerned, I said 'no.' I did not think that I\nhad the right to kill a man; but I felt it my duty to exterminate evil.\nI voted the end of the tyrant, that is to say, the end of prostitution\nfor woman, the end of slavery for man, the end of night for the child.\nIn voting for the Republic, I voted for that. I voted for fraternity,\nconcord, the dawn. I have aided in the overthrow of prejudices and\nerrors. The crumbling away of prejudices and errors causes light. We\nhave caused the fall of the old world, and the old world, that vase of\nmiseries, has become, through its upsetting upon the human race, an urn\nof joy.\"\n\n\"Mixed joy,\" said the Bishop.\n\n\"You may say troubled joy, and to-day, after that fatal return of the\npast, which is called 1814, joy which has disappeared! Alas! The work\nwas incomplete, I admit: we demolished the ancient regime in deeds; we\nwere not able to suppress it entirely in ideas. To destroy abuses is not\nsufficient; customs must be modified. The mill is there no longer; the\nwind is still there.\"\n\n\"You have demolished. It may be of use to demolish, but I distrust a\ndemolition complicated with wrath.\"\n\n\"Right has its wrath, Bishop; and the wrath of right is an element of\nprogress. In any case, and in spite of whatever may be said, the French\nRevolution is the most important step of the human race since the advent\nof Christ. Incomplete, it may be, but sublime. It set free all the\nunknown social quantities; it softened spirits, it calmed, appeased,\nenlightened; it caused the waves of civilization to flow over the\nearth. It was a good thing. The French Revolution is the consecration of\nhumanity.\"\n\nThe Bishop could not refrain from murmuring:--\n\n\"Yes? '93!\"\n\nThe member of the Convention straightened himself up in his chair with\nan almost lugubrious solemnity, and exclaimed, so far as a dying man is\ncapable of exclamation:--\n\n\"Ah, there you go; '93! I was expecting that word. A cloud had been\nforming for the space of fifteen hundred years; at the end of fifteen\nhundred years it burst. You are putting the thunderbolt on its trial.\"\n\nThe Bishop felt, without, perhaps, confessing it, that something within\nhim had suffered extinction. Nevertheless, he put a good face on the\nmatter. He replied:--\n\n\"The judge speaks in the name of justice; the priest speaks in the name\nof pity, which is nothing but a more lofty justice. A thunderbolt should\ncommit no error.\" And he added, regarding the member of the Convention\nsteadily the while, \"Louis XVII.?\"\n\nThe conventionary stretched forth his hand and grasped the Bishop's arm.\n\n\"Louis XVII.! let us see. For whom do you mourn? is it for the innocent\nchild? very good; in that case I mourn with you. Is it for the royal\nchild? I demand time for reflection. To me, the brother of Cartouche,\nan innocent child who was hung up by the armpits in the Place de Greve,\nuntil death ensued, for the sole crime of having been the brother\nof Cartouche, is no less painful than the grandson of Louis XV., an\ninnocent child, martyred in the tower of the Temple, for the sole crime\nof having been grandson of Louis XV.\"\n\n\"Monsieur,\" said the Bishop, \"I like not this conjunction of names.\"\n\n\"Cartouche? Louis XV.? To which of the two do you object?\"\n\nA momentary silence ensued. The Bishop almost regretted having come, and\nyet he felt vaguely and strangely shaken.\n\nThe conventionary resumed:--\n\n\"Ah, Monsieur Priest, you love not the crudities of the true. Christ\nloved them. He seized a rod and cleared out the Temple. His scourge,\nfull of lightnings, was a harsh speaker of truths. When he cried,\n'Sinite parvulos,' he made no distinction between the little children.\nIt would not have embarrassed him to bring together the Dauphin of\nBarabbas and the Dauphin of Herod. Innocence, Monsieur, is its own\ncrown. Innocence has no need to be a highness. It is as august in rags\nas in fleurs de lys.\"\n\n\"That is true,\" said the Bishop in a low voice.\n\n\"I persist,\" continued the conventionary G---- \"You have mentioned Louis\nXVII. to me. Let us come to an understanding. Shall we weep for all the\ninnocent, all martyrs, all children, the lowly as well as the exalted?\nI agree to that. But in that case, as I have told you, we must go back\nfurther than '93, and our tears must begin before Louis XVII. I will\nweep with you over the children of kings, provided that you will weep\nwith me over the children of the people.\"\n\n\"I weep for all,\" said the Bishop.\n\n\"Equally!\" exclaimed conventionary G----; \"and if the balance must\nincline, let it be on the side of the people. They have been suffering\nlonger.\"\n\nAnother silence ensued. The conventionary was the first to break it. He\nraised himself on one elbow, took a bit of his cheek between his thumb\nand his forefinger, as one does mechanically when one interrogates and\njudges, and appealed to the Bishop with a gaze full of all the forces of\nthe death agony. It was almost an explosion.\n\n\"Yes, sir, the people have been suffering a long while. And hold! that\nis not all, either; why have you just questioned me and talked to me\nabout Louis XVII.? I know you not. Ever since I have been in these parts\nI have dwelt in this enclosure alone, never setting foot outside, and\nseeing no one but that child who helps me. Your name has reached me in\na confused manner, it is true, and very badly pronounced, I must admit;\nbut that signifies nothing: clever men have so many ways of imposing on\nthat honest goodman, the people. By the way, I did not hear the sound of\nyour carriage; you have left it yonder, behind the coppice at the fork\nof the roads, no doubt. I do not know you, I tell you. You have told me\nthat you are the Bishop; but that affords me no information as to your\nmoral personality. In short, I repeat my question. Who are you? You are\na bishop; that is to say, a prince of the church, one of those gilded\nmen with heraldic bearings and revenues, who have vast prebends,--the\nbishopric of D---- fifteen thousand francs settled income, ten thousand\nin perquisites; total, twenty-five thousand francs,--who have kitchens,\nwho have liveries, who make good cheer, who eat moor-hens on Friday, who\nstrut about, a lackey before, a lackey behind, in a gala coach, and\nwho have palaces, and who roll in their carriages in the name of Jesus\nChrist who went barefoot! You are a prelate,--revenues, palace, horses,\nservants, good table, all the sensualities of life; you have this like\nthe rest, and like the rest, you enjoy it; it is well; but this says\neither too much or too little; this does not enlighten me upon the\nintrinsic and essential value of the man who comes with the probable\nintention of bringing wisdom to me. To whom do I speak? Who are you?\"\n\nThe Bishop hung his head and replied, \"Vermis sum--I am a worm.\"\n\n\"A worm of the earth in a carriage?\" growled the conventionary.\n\nIt was the conventionary's turn to be arrogant, and the Bishop's to be\nhumble.\n\nThe Bishop resumed mildly:--\n\n\"So be it, sir. But explain to me how my carriage, which is a few paces\noff behind the trees yonder, how my good table and the moor-hens which I\neat on Friday, how my twenty-five thousand francs income, how my palace\nand my lackeys prove that clemency is not a duty, and that '93 was not\ninexorable.\"\n\nThe conventionary passed his hand across his brow, as though to sweep\naway a cloud.\n\n\"Before replying to you,\" he said, \"I beseech you to pardon me. I have\njust committed a wrong, sir. You are at my house, you are my guest, I\nowe you courtesy. You discuss my ideas, and it becomes me to confine\nmyself to combating your arguments. Your riches and your pleasures are\nadvantages which I hold over you in the debate; but good taste dictates\nthat I shall not make use of them. I promise you to make no use of them\nin the future.\"\n\n\"I thank you,\" said the Bishop.\n\nG---- resumed.\n\n\"Let us return to the explanation which you have asked of me. Where were\nwe? What were you saying to me? That '93 was inexorable?\"\n\n\"Inexorable; yes,\" said the Bishop. \"What think you of Marat clapping\nhis hands at the guillotine?\"\n\n\"What think you of Bossuet chanting the Te Deum over the dragonnades?\"\n\nThe retort was a harsh one, but it attained its mark with the directness\nof a point of steel. The Bishop quivered under it; no reply occurred to\nhim; but he was offended by this mode of alluding to Bossuet. The best\nof minds will have their fetiches, and they sometimes feel vaguely\nwounded by the want of respect of logic.\n\nThe conventionary began to pant; the asthma of the agony which is\nmingled with the last breaths interrupted his voice; still, there was a\nperfect lucidity of soul in his eyes. He went on:--\n\n\"Let me say a few words more in this and that direction; I am willing.\nApart from the Revolution, which, taken as a whole, is an immense human\naffirmation, '93 is, alas! a rejoinder. You think it inexorable, sir;\nbut what of the whole monarchy, sir? Carrier is a bandit; but what name\ndo you give to Montrevel? Fouquier-Tainville is a rascal; but what\nis your opinion as to Lamoignon-Baville? Maillard is terrible; but\nSaulx-Tavannes, if you please? Duchene senior is ferocious; but what\nepithet will you allow me for the elder Letellier? Jourdan-Coupe-Tete\nis a monster; but not so great a one as M. the Marquis de Louvois. Sir,\nsir, I am sorry for Marie Antoinette, archduchess and queen; but I am\nalso sorry for that poor Huguenot woman, who, in 1685, under Louis the\nGreat, sir, while with a nursing infant, was bound, naked to the waist,\nto a stake, and the child kept at a distance; her breast swelled with\nmilk and her heart with anguish; the little one, hungry and pale, beheld\nthat breast and cried and agonized; the executioner said to the woman, a\nmother and a nurse, 'Abjure!' giving her her choice between the death of\nher infant and the death of her conscience. What say you to that torture\nof Tantalus as applied to a mother? Bear this well in mind sir: the\nFrench Revolution had its reasons for existence; its wrath will be\nabsolved by the future; its result is the world made better. From its\nmost terrible blows there comes forth a caress for the human race. I\nabridge, I stop, I have too much the advantage; moreover, I am dying.\"\n\nAnd ceasing to gaze at the Bishop, the conventionary concluded his\nthoughts in these tranquil words:--\n\n\"Yes, the brutalities of progress are called revolutions. When they are\nover, this fact is recognized,--that the human race has been treated\nharshly, but that it has progressed.\"\n\nThe conventionary doubted not that he had successively conquered all the\ninmost intrenchments of the Bishop. One remained, however, and from this\nintrenchment, the last resource of Monseigneur Bienvenu's resistance,\ncame forth this reply, wherein appeared nearly all the harshness of the\nbeginning:--\n\n\"Progress should believe in God. Good cannot have an impious servitor.\nHe who is an atheist is but a bad leader for the human race.\"\n\nThe former representative of the people made no reply. He was seized\nwith a fit of trembling. He looked towards heaven, and in his glance a\ntear gathered slowly. When the eyelid was full, the tear trickled down\nhis livid cheek, and he said, almost in a stammer, quite low, and to\nhimself, while his eyes were plunged in the depths:--\n\n\"O thou! O ideal! Thou alone existest!\"\n\nThe Bishop experienced an indescribable shock.\n\nAfter a pause, the old man raised a finger heavenward and said:--\n\n\"The infinite is. He is there. If the infinite had no person, person\nwould be without limit; it would not be infinite; in other words, it\nwould not exist. There is, then, an _I_. That _I_ of the infinite is\nGod.\"\n\nThe dying man had pronounced these last words in a loud voice, and with\nthe shiver of ecstasy, as though he beheld some one. When he had spoken,\nhis eyes closed. The effort had exhausted him. It was evident that he\nhad just lived through in a moment the few hours which had been left to\nhim. That which he had said brought him nearer to him who is in death.\nThe supreme moment was approaching.\n\nThe Bishop understood this; time pressed; it was as a priest that he had\ncome: from extreme coldness he had passed by degrees to extreme emotion;\nhe gazed at those closed eyes, he took that wrinkled, aged and ice-cold\nhand in his, and bent over the dying man.\n\n\"This hour is the hour of God. Do you not think that it would be\nregrettable if we had met in vain?\"\n\nThe conventionary opened his eyes again. A gravity mingled with gloom\nwas imprinted on his countenance.\n\n\"Bishop,\" said he, with a slowness which probably arose more from his\ndignity of soul than from the failing of his strength, \"I have passed my\nlife in meditation, study, and contemplation. I was sixty years of age\nwhen my country called me and commanded me to concern myself with its\naffairs. I obeyed. Abuses existed, I combated them; tyrannies existed,\nI destroyed them; rights and principles existed, I proclaimed and\nconfessed them. Our territory was invaded, I defended it; France was\nmenaced, I offered my breast. I was not rich; I am poor. I have been one\nof the masters of the state; the vaults of the treasury were encumbered\nwith specie to such a degree that we were forced to shore up the walls,\nwhich were on the point of bursting beneath the weight of gold and\nsilver; I dined in Dead Tree Street, at twenty-two sous. I have succored\nthe oppressed, I have comforted the suffering. I tore the cloth from\nthe altar, it is true; but it was to bind up the wounds of my country. I\nhave always upheld the march forward of the human race, forward towards\nthe light, and I have sometimes resisted progress without pity. I have,\nwhen the occasion offered, protected my own adversaries, men of your\nprofession. And there is at Peteghem, in Flanders, at the very spot\nwhere the Merovingian kings had their summer palace, a convent of\nUrbanists, the Abbey of Sainte Claire en Beaulieu, which I saved in\n1793. I have done my duty according to my powers, and all the good\nthat I was able. After which, I was hunted down, pursued, persecuted,\nblackened, jeered at, scorned, cursed, proscribed. For many years past,\nI with my white hair have been conscious that many people think they\nhave the right to despise me; to the poor ignorant masses I present the\nvisage of one damned. And I accept this isolation of hatred, without\nhating any one myself. Now I am eighty-six years old; I am on the point\nof death. What is it that you have come to ask of me?\"\n\n\"Your blessing,\" said the Bishop.\n\nAnd he knelt down.\n\nWhen the Bishop raised his head again, the face of the conventionary had\nbecome august. He had just expired.\n\nThe Bishop returned home, deeply absorbed in thoughts which cannot\nbe known to us. He passed the whole night in prayer. On the following\nmorning some bold and curious persons attempted to speak to him about\nmember of the Convention G----; he contented himself with pointing\nheavenward.\n\nFrom that moment he redoubled his tenderness and brotherly feeling\ntowards all children and sufferers.\n\nAny allusion to \"that old wretch of a G----\" caused him to fall into a\nsingular preoccupation. No one could say that the passage of that soul\nbefore his, and the reflection of that grand conscience upon his, did\nnot count for something in his approach to perfection.\n\nThis \"pastoral visit\" naturally furnished an occasion for a murmur of\ncomment in all the little local coteries.\n\n\"Was the bedside of such a dying man as that the proper place for a\nbishop? There was evidently no conversion to be expected. All those\nrevolutionists are backsliders. Then why go there? What was there to be\nseen there? He must have been very curious indeed to see a soul carried\noff by the devil.\"\n\nOne day a dowager of the impertinent variety who thinks herself\nspiritual, addressed this sally to him, \"Monseigneur, people are\ninquiring when Your Greatness will receive the red cap!\"--\"Oh! oh!\nthat's a coarse color,\" replied the Bishop. \"It is lucky that those who\ndespise it in a cap revere it in a hat.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI--A RESTRICTION\n\nWe should incur a great risk of deceiving ourselves, were we to conclude\nfrom this that Monseigneur Welcome was \"a philosophical bishop,\" or a\n\"patriotic cure.\" His meeting, which may almost be designated as his\nunion, with conventionary G----, left behind it in his mind a sort of\nastonishment, which rendered him still more gentle. That is all.\n\nAlthough Monseigneur Bienvenu was far from being a politician, this is,\nperhaps, the place to indicate very briefly what his attitude was in the\nevents of that epoch, supposing that Monseigneur Bienvenu ever dreamed\nof having an attitude.\n\nLet us, then, go back a few years.\n\nSome time after the elevation of M. Myriel to the episcopate, the\nEmperor had made him a baron of the Empire, in company with many other\nbishops. The arrest of the Pope took place, as every one knows, on the\nnight of the 5th to the 6th of July, 1809; on this occasion, M. Myriel\nwas summoned by Napoleon to the synod of the bishops of France and Italy\nconvened at Paris. This synod was held at Notre-Dame, and assembled\nfor the first time on the 15th of June, 1811, under the presidency\nof Cardinal Fesch. M. Myriel was one of the ninety-five bishops who\nattended it. But he was present only at one sitting and at three or four\nprivate conferences. Bishop of a mountain diocese, living so very close\nto nature, in rusticity and deprivation, it appeared that he imported\namong these eminent personages, ideas which altered the temperature of\nthe assembly. He very soon returned to D---- He was interrogated as to\nthis speedy return, and he replied: \"I embarrassed them. The outside air\npenetrated to them through me. I produced on them the effect of an open\ndoor.\"\n\nOn another occasion he said, \"What would you have? Those gentlemen are\nprinces. I am only a poor peasant bishop.\"\n\nThe fact is that he displeased them. Among other strange things, it is\nsaid that he chanced to remark one evening, when he found himself at\nthe house of one of his most notable colleagues: \"What beautiful clocks!\nWhat beautiful carpets! What beautiful liveries! They must be a great\ntrouble. I would not have all those superfluities, crying incessantly\nin my ears: 'There are people who are hungry! There are people who are\ncold! There are poor people! There are poor people!'\"\n\nLet us remark, by the way, that the hatred of luxury is not an\nintelligent hatred. This hatred would involve the hatred of the arts.\nNevertheless, in churchmen, luxury is wrong, except in connection with\nrepresentations and ceremonies. It seems to reveal habits which have\nvery little that is charitable about them. An opulent priest is a\ncontradiction. The priest must keep close to the poor. Now, can one come\nin contact incessantly night and day with all this distress, all these\nmisfortunes, and this poverty, without having about one's own person a\nlittle of that misery, like the dust of labor? Is it possible to imagine\na man near a brazier who is not warm? Can one imagine a workman who is\nworking near a furnace, and who has neither a singed hair, nor blackened\nnails, nor a drop of sweat, nor a speck of ashes on his face? The first\nproof of charity in the priest, in the bishop especially, is poverty.\n\nThis is, no doubt, what the Bishop of D---- thought.\n\nIt must not be supposed, however, that he shared what we call the \"ideas\nof the century\" on certain delicate points. He took very little part\nin the theological quarrels of the moment, and maintained silence on\nquestions in which Church and State were implicated; but if he had\nbeen strongly pressed, it seems that he would have been found to be an\nultramontane rather than a gallican. Since we are making a portrait, and\nsince we do not wish to conceal anything, we are forced to add that he\nwas glacial towards Napoleon in his decline. Beginning with 1813, he\ngave in his adherence to or applauded all hostile manifestations. He\nrefused to see him, as he passed through on his return from the island\nof Elba, and he abstained from ordering public prayers for the Emperor\nin his diocese during the Hundred Days.\n\nBesides his sister, Mademoiselle Baptistine, he had two brothers, one a\ngeneral, the other a prefect. He wrote to both with tolerable frequency.\nHe was harsh for a time towards the former, because, holding a command\nin Provence at the epoch of the disembarkation at Cannes, the general\nhad put himself at the head of twelve hundred men and had pursued the\nEmperor as though the latter had been a person whom one is desirous\nof allowing to escape. His correspondence with the other brother, the\nex-prefect, a fine, worthy man who lived in retirement at Paris, Rue\nCassette, remained more affectionate.\n\nThus Monseigneur Bienvenu also had his hour of party spirit, his hour\nof bitterness, his cloud. The shadow of the passions of the moment\ntraversed this grand and gentle spirit occupied with eternal things.\nCertainly, such a man would have done well not to entertain any\npolitical opinions. Let there be no mistake as to our meaning: we are\nnot confounding what is called \"political opinions\" with the grand\naspiration for progress, with the sublime faith, patriotic, democratic,\nhumane, which in our day should be the very foundation of every generous\nintellect. Without going deeply into questions which are only indirectly\nconnected with the subject of this book, we will simply say this: It\nwould have been well if Monseigneur Bienvenu had not been a Royalist,\nand if his glance had never been, for a single instant, turned away from\nthat serene contemplation in which is distinctly discernible, above the\nfictions and the hatreds of this world, above the stormy vicissitudes of\nhuman things, the beaming of those three pure radiances, truth, justice,\nand charity.\n\nWhile admitting that it was not for a political office that God created\nMonseigneur Welcome, we should have understood and admired his protest\nin the name of right and liberty, his proud opposition, his just but\nperilous resistance to the all-powerful Napoleon. But that which pleases\nus in people who are rising pleases us less in the case of people who\nare falling. We only love the fray so long as there is danger, and in\nany case, the combatants of the first hour have alone the right to be\nthe exterminators of the last. He who has not been a stubborn accuser in\nprosperity should hold his peace in the face of ruin. The denunciator of\nsuccess is the only legitimate executioner of the fall. As for us, when\nProvidence intervenes and strikes, we let it work. 1812 commenced to\ndisarm us. In 1813 the cowardly breach of silence of that taciturn\nlegislative body, emboldened by catastrophe, possessed only traits which\naroused indignation. And it was a crime to applaud, in 1814, in the\npresence of those marshals who betrayed; in the presence of that senate\nwhich passed from one dunghill to another, insulting after having\ndeified; in the presence of that idolatry which was loosing its footing\nand spitting on its idol,--it was a duty to turn aside the head. In\n1815, when the supreme disasters filled the air, when France was seized\nwith a shiver at their sinister approach, when Waterloo could be dimly\ndiscerned opening before Napoleon, the mournful acclamation of the army\nand the people to the condemned of destiny had nothing laughable in it,\nand, after making all allowance for the despot, a heart like that of\nthe Bishop of D----, ought not perhaps to have failed to recognize the\naugust and touching features presented by the embrace of a great nation\nand a great man on the brink of the abyss.\n\nWith this exception, he was in all things just, true, equitable,\nintelligent, humble and dignified, beneficent and kindly, which is only\nanother sort of benevolence. He was a priest, a sage, and a man. It must\nbe admitted, that even in the political views with which we have just\nreproached him, and which we are disposed to judge almost with severity,\nhe was tolerant and easy, more so, perhaps, than we who are speaking\nhere. The porter of the town-hall had been placed there by the Emperor.\nHe was an old non-commissioned officer of the old guard, a member of the\nLegion of Honor at Austerlitz, as much of a Bonapartist as the eagle.\nThis poor fellow occasionally let slip inconsiderate remarks, which the\nlaw then stigmatized as seditious speeches. After the imperial profile\ndisappeared from the Legion of Honor, he never dressed himself in his\nregimentals, as he said, so that he should not be obliged to wear his\ncross. He had himself devoutly removed the imperial effigy from the\ncross which Napoleon had given him; this made a hole, and he would not\nput anything in its place. \"I will die,\" he said, \"rather than wear the\nthree frogs upon my heart!\" He liked to scoff aloud at Louis XVIII. \"The\ngouty old creature in English gaiters!\" he said; \"let him take himself\noff to Prussia with that queue of his.\" He was happy to combine in the\nsame imprecation the two things which he most detested, Prussia and\nEngland. He did it so often that he lost his place. There he was, turned\nout of the house, with his wife and children, and without bread. The\nBishop sent for him, reproved him gently, and appointed him beadle in\nthe cathedral.\n\nIn the course of nine years Monseigneur Bienvenu had, by dint of holy\ndeeds and gentle manners, filled the town of D----with a sort of\ntender and filial reverence. Even his conduct towards Napoleon had been\naccepted and tacitly pardoned, as it were, by the people, the good and\nweakly flock who adored their emperor, but loved their bishop.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII--THE SOLITUDE OF MONSEIGNEUR WELCOME\n\nA bishop is almost always surrounded by a full squadron of little abbes,\njust as a general is by a covey of young officers. This is what\nthat charming Saint Francois de Sales calls somewhere \"les pretres\nblancs-becs,\" callow priests. Every career has its aspirants, who form\na train for those who have attained eminence in it. There is no power\nwhich has not its dependents. There is no fortune which has not its\ncourt. The seekers of the future eddy around the splendid present. Every\nmetropolis has its staff of officials. Every bishop who possesses the\nleast influence has about him his patrol of cherubim from the seminary,\nwhich goes the round, and maintains good order in the episcopal palace,\nand mounts guard over monseigneur's smile. To please a bishop is\nequivalent to getting one's foot in the stirrup for a sub-diaconate.\nIt is necessary to walk one's path discreetly; the apostleship does not\ndisdain the canonship.\n\nJust as there are bigwigs elsewhere, there are big mitres in the Church.\nThese are the bishops who stand well at Court, who are rich, well\nendowed, skilful, accepted by the world, who know how to pray, no doubt,\nbut who know also how to beg, who feel little scruple at making a whole\ndiocese dance attendance in their person, who are connecting links\nbetween the sacristy and diplomacy, who are abbes rather than priests,\nprelates rather than bishops. Happy those who approach them! Being\npersons of influence, they create a shower about them, upon the\nassiduous and the favored, and upon all the young men who understand\nthe art of pleasing, of large parishes, prebends, archidiaconates,\nchaplaincies, and cathedral posts, while awaiting episcopal honors. As\nthey advance themselves, they cause their satellites to progress also;\nit is a whole solar system on the march. Their radiance casts a gleam\nof purple over their suite. Their prosperity is crumbled up behind\nthe scenes, into nice little promotions. The larger the diocese of the\npatron, the fatter the curacy for the favorite. And then, there is Rome.\nA bishop who understands how to become an archbishop, an archbishop who\nknows how to become a cardinal, carries you with him as conclavist;\nyou enter a court of papal jurisdiction, you receive the pallium, and\nbehold! you are an auditor, then a papal chamberlain, then monsignor,\nand from a Grace to an Eminence is only a step, and between the Eminence\nand the Holiness there is but the smoke of a ballot. Every skull-cap may\ndream of the tiara. The priest is nowadays the only man who can become a\nking in a regular manner; and what a king! the supreme king. Then what a\nnursery of aspirations is a seminary! How many blushing choristers,\nhow many youthful abbes bear on their heads Perrette's pot of milk!\nWho knows how easy it is for ambition to call itself vocation? in good\nfaith, perchance, and deceiving itself, devotee that it is.\n\nMonseigneur Bienvenu, poor, humble, retiring, was not accounted among\nthe big mitres. This was plain from the complete absence of young\npriests about him. We have seen that he \"did not take\" in Paris. Not a\nsingle future dreamed of engrafting itself on this solitary old man.\nNot a single sprouting ambition committed the folly of putting forth its\nfoliage in his shadow. His canons and grand-vicars were good old men,\nrather vulgar like himself, walled up like him in this diocese, without\nexit to a cardinalship, and who resembled their bishop, with this\ndifference, that they were finished and he was completed. The\nimpossibility of growing great under Monseigneur Bienvenu was so well\nunderstood, that no sooner had the young men whom he ordained left the\nseminary than they got themselves recommended to the archbishops of Aix\nor of Auch, and went off in a great hurry. For, in short, we repeat it,\nmen wish to be pushed. A saint who dwells in a paroxysm of abnegation\nis a dangerous neighbor; he might communicate to you, by contagion,\nan incurable poverty, an anchylosis of the joints, which are useful in\nadvancement, and in short, more renunciation than you desire; and\nthis infectious virtue is avoided. Hence the isolation of Monseigneur\nBienvenu. We live in the midst of a gloomy society. Success; that is the\nlesson which falls drop by drop from the slope of corruption.\n\nBe it said in passing, that success is a very hideous thing. Its false\nresemblance to merit deceives men. For the masses, success has almost\nthe same profile as supremacy. Success, that Menaechmus of talent, has\none dupe,--history. Juvenal and Tacitus alone grumble at it. In our\nday, a philosophy which is almost official has entered into its\nservice, wears the livery of success, and performs the service of its\nantechamber. Succeed: theory. Prosperity argues capacity. Win in the\nlottery, and behold! you are a clever man. He who triumphs is venerated.\nBe born with a silver spoon in your mouth! everything lies in that. Be\nlucky, and you will have all the rest; be happy, and people will think\nyou great. Outside of five or six immense exceptions, which compose\nthe splendor of a century, contemporary admiration is nothing but\nshort-sightedness. Gilding is gold. It does no harm to be the first\narrival by pure chance, so long as you do arrive. The common herd is an\nold Narcissus who adores himself, and who applauds the vulgar herd.\nThat enormous ability by virtue of which one is Moses, Aeschylus, Dante,\nMichael Angelo, or Napoleon, the multitude awards on the spot, and by\nacclamation, to whomsoever attains his object, in whatsoever it may\nconsist. Let a notary transfigure himself into a deputy: let a false\nCorneille compose Tiridate; let a eunuch come to possess a harem; let a\nmilitary Prudhomme accidentally win the decisive battle of an epoch;\nlet an apothecary invent cardboard shoe-soles for the army of the\nSambre-and-Meuse, and construct for himself, out of this cardboard, sold\nas leather, four hundred thousand francs of income; let a pork-packer\nespouse usury, and cause it to bring forth seven or eight millions, of\nwhich he is the father and of which it is the mother; let a preacher\nbecome a bishop by force of his nasal drawl; let the steward of a fine\nfamily be so rich on retiring from service that he is made minister\nof finances,--and men call that Genius, just as they call the face\nof Mousqueton Beauty, and the mien of Claude Majesty. With the\nconstellations of space they confound the stars of the abyss which are\nmade in the soft mire of the puddle by the feet of ducks.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII--WHAT HE BELIEVED\n\nWe are not obliged to sound the Bishop of D---- on the score of\northodoxy. In the presence of such a soul we feel ourselves in no mood\nbut respect. The conscience of the just man should be accepted on his\nword. Moreover, certain natures being given, we admit the possible\ndevelopment of all beauties of human virtue in a belief that differs\nfrom our own.\n\nWhat did he think of this dogma, or of that mystery? These secrets of\nthe inner tribunal of the conscience are known only to the tomb, where\nsouls enter naked. The point on which we are certain is, that the\ndifficulties of faith never resolved themselves into hypocrisy in his\ncase. No decay is possible to the diamond. He believed to the extent\nof his powers. \"Credo in Patrem,\" he often exclaimed. Moreover, he\ndrew from good works that amount of satisfaction which suffices to the\nconscience, and which whispers to a man, \"Thou art with God!\"\n\nThe point which we consider it our duty to note is, that outside of and\nbeyond his faith, as it were, the Bishop possessed an excess of love. It\nwas in that quarter, quia multum amavit,--because he loved much--that\nhe was regarded as vulnerable by \"serious men,\" \"grave persons\" and\n\"reasonable people\"; favorite locutions of our sad world where egotism\ntakes its word of command from pedantry. What was this excess of love?\nIt was a serene benevolence which overflowed men, as we have already\npointed out, and which, on occasion, extended even to things. He lived\nwithout disdain. He was indulgent towards God's creation. Every man,\neven the best, has within him a thoughtless harshness which he reserves\nfor animals. The Bishop of D---- had none of that harshness, which is\npeculiar to many priests, nevertheless. He did not go as far as the\nBrahmin, but he seemed to have weighed this saying of Ecclesiastes: \"Who\nknoweth whither the soul of the animal goeth?\" Hideousness of aspect,\ndeformity of instinct, troubled him not, and did not arouse his\nindignation. He was touched, almost softened by them. It seemed as\nthough he went thoughtfully away to seek beyond the bounds of life which\nis apparent, the cause, the explanation, or the excuse for them. He\nseemed at times to be asking God to commute these penalties. He examined\nwithout wrath, and with the eye of a linguist who is deciphering a\npalimpsest, that portion of chaos which still exists in nature. This\nrevery sometimes caused him to utter odd sayings. One morning he was in\nhis garden, and thought himself alone, but his sister was walking behind\nhim, unseen by him: suddenly he paused and gazed at something on the\nground; it was a large, black, hairy, frightful spider. His sister heard\nhim say:--\n\n\"Poor beast! It is not its fault!\"\n\nWhy not mention these almost divinely childish sayings of kindness?\nPuerile they may be; but these sublime puerilities were peculiar to\nSaint Francis d'Assisi and of Marcus Aurelius. One day he sprained his\nankle in his effort to avoid stepping on an ant. Thus lived this just\nman. Sometimes he fell asleep in his garden, and then there was nothing\nmore venerable possible.\n\nMonseigneur Bienvenu had formerly been, if the stories anent his youth,\nand even in regard to his manhood, were to be believed, a passionate,\nand, possibly, a violent man. His universal suavity was less an instinct\nof nature than the result of a grand conviction which had filtered into\nhis heart through the medium of life, and had trickled there slowly,\nthought by thought; for, in a character, as in a rock, there may exist\napertures made by drops of water. These hollows are uneffaceable; these\nformations are indestructible.\n\nIn 1815, as we think we have already said, he reached his seventy-fifth\nbirthday, but he did not appear to be more than sixty. He was not tall;\nhe was rather plump; and, in order to combat this tendency, he was fond\nof taking long strolls on foot; his step was firm, and his form was\nbut slightly bent, a detail from which we do not pretend to draw any\nconclusion. Gregory XVI., at the age of eighty, held himself erect and\nsmiling, which did not prevent him from being a bad bishop. Monseigneur\nWelcome had what the people term a \"fine head,\" but so amiable was he\nthat they forgot that it was fine.\n\nWhen he conversed with that infantile gayety which was one of his\ncharms, and of which we have already spoken, people felt at their ease\nwith him, and joy seemed to radiate from his whole person. His fresh and\nruddy complexion, his very white teeth, all of which he had preserved,\nand which were displayed by his smile, gave him that open and easy air\nwhich cause the remark to be made of a man, \"He's a good fellow\"; and\nof an old man, \"He is a fine man.\" That, it will be recalled, was the\neffect which he produced upon Napoleon. On the first encounter, and to\none who saw him for the first time, he was nothing, in fact, but a fine\nman. But if one remained near him for a few hours, and beheld him in the\nleast degree pensive, the fine man became gradually transfigured, and\ntook on some imposing quality, I know not what; his broad and serious\nbrow, rendered august by his white locks, became august also by virtue\nof meditation; majesty radiated from his goodness, though his goodness\nceased not to be radiant; one experienced something of the emotion which\none would feel on beholding a smiling angel slowly unfold his wings,\nwithout ceasing to smile. Respect, an unutterable respect, penetrated\nyou by degrees and mounted to your heart, and one felt that one had\nbefore him one of those strong, thoroughly tried, and indulgent souls\nwhere thought is so grand that it can no longer be anything but gentle.\n\nAs we have seen, prayer, the celebration of the offices of religion,\nalms-giving, the consolation of the afflicted, the cultivation of a bit\nof land, fraternity, frugality, hospitality, renunciation, confidence,\nstudy, work, filled every day of his life. Filled is exactly the word;\ncertainly the Bishop's day was quite full to the brim, of good words and\ngood deeds. Nevertheless, it was not complete if cold or rainy weather\nprevented his passing an hour or two in his garden before going to bed,\nand after the two women had retired. It seemed to be a sort of rite with\nhim, to prepare himself for slumber by meditation in the presence of\nthe grand spectacles of the nocturnal heavens. Sometimes, if the two old\nwomen were not asleep, they heard him pacing slowly along the walks at\na very advanced hour of the night. He was there alone, communing with\nhimself, peaceful, adoring, comparing the serenity of his heart with the\nserenity of the ether, moved amid the darkness by the visible splendor\nof the constellations and the invisible splendor of God, opening his\nheart to the thoughts which fall from the Unknown. At such moments,\nwhile he offered his heart at the hour when nocturnal flowers offer\ntheir perfume, illuminated like a lamp amid the starry night, as he\npoured himself out in ecstasy in the midst of the universal radiance of\ncreation, he could not have told himself, probably, what was passing in\nhis spirit; he felt something take its flight from him, and something\ndescend into him. Mysterious exchange of the abysses of the soul with\nthe abysses of the universe!\n\nHe thought of the grandeur and presence of God; of the future eternity,\nthat strange mystery; of the eternity past, a mystery still more\nstrange; of all the infinities, which pierced their way into all\nhis senses, beneath his eyes; and, without seeking to comprehend the\nincomprehensible, he gazed upon it. He did not study God; he was dazzled\nby him. He considered those magnificent conjunctions of atoms, which\ncommunicate aspects to matter, reveal forces by verifying them, create\nindividualities in unity, proportions in extent, the innumerable in the\ninfinite, and, through light, produce beauty. These conjunctions are\nformed and dissolved incessantly; hence life and death.\n\nHe seated himself on a wooden bench, with his back against a decrepit\nvine; he gazed at the stars, past the puny and stunted silhouettes\nof his fruit-trees. This quarter of an acre, so poorly planted, so\nencumbered with mean buildings and sheds, was dear to him, and satisfied\nhis wants.\n\nWhat more was needed by this old man, who divided the leisure of his\nlife, where there was so little leisure, between gardening in the\ndaytime and contemplation at night? Was not this narrow enclosure, with\nthe heavens for a ceiling, sufficient to enable him to adore God in his\nmost divine works, in turn? Does not this comprehend all, in fact? and\nwhat is there left to desire beyond it? A little garden in which to\nwalk, and immensity in which to dream. At one's feet that which can be\ncultivated and plucked; over head that which one can study and meditate\nupon: some flowers on earth, and all the stars in the sky.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV--WHAT HE THOUGHT\n\n\nOne last word.\n\nSince this sort of details might, particularly at the present moment,\nand to use an expression now in fashion, give to the Bishop of D---- a\ncertain \"pantheistical\" physiognomy, and induce the belief, either\nto his credit or discredit, that he entertained one of those personal\nphilosophies which are peculiar to our century, which sometimes spring\nup in solitary spirits, and there take on a form and grow until they\nusurp the place of religion, we insist upon it, that not one of\nthose persons who knew Monseigneur Welcome would have thought himself\nauthorized to think anything of the sort. That which enlightened this\nman was his heart. His wisdom was made of the light which comes from\nthere.\n\nNo systems; many works. Abstruse speculations contain vertigo; no,\nthere is nothing to indicate that he risked his mind in apocalypses. The\napostle may be daring, but the bishop must be timid. He would probably\nhave felt a scruple at sounding too far in advance certain problems\nwhich are, in a manner, reserved for terrible great minds. There is a\nsacred horror beneath the porches of the enigma; those gloomy openings\nstand yawning there, but something tells you, you, a passer-by in life,\nthat you must not enter. Woe to him who penetrates thither!\n\nGeniuses in the impenetrable depths of abstraction and pure speculation,\nsituated, so to speak, above all dogmas, propose their ideas to\nGod. Their prayer audaciously offers discussion. Their adoration\ninterrogates. This is direct religion, which is full of anxiety and\nresponsibility for him who attempts its steep cliffs.\n\nHuman meditation has no limits. At his own risk and peril, it analyzes\nand digs deep into its own bedazzlement. One might almost say, that by\na sort of splendid reaction, it with it dazzles nature; the mysterious\nworld which surrounds us renders back what it has received; it is\nprobable that the contemplators are contemplated. However that may be,\nthere are on earth men who--are they men?--perceive distinctly at the\nverge of the horizons of revery the heights of the absolute, and who\nhave the terrible vision of the infinite mountain. Monseigneur Welcome\nwas one of these men; Monseigneur Welcome was not a genius. He would\nhave feared those sublimities whence some very great men even, like\nSwedenborg and Pascal, have slipped into insanity. Certainly, these\npowerful reveries have their moral utility, and by these arduous paths\none approaches to ideal perfection. As for him, he took the path which\nshortens,--the Gospel's.\n\nHe did not attempt to impart to his chasuble the folds of Elijah's\nmantle; he projected no ray of future upon the dark groundswell of\nevents; he did not seek to condense in flame the light of things; he\nhad nothing of the prophet and nothing of the magician about him. This\nhumble soul loved, and that was all.\n\nThat he carried prayer to the pitch of a superhuman aspiration is\nprobable: but one can no more pray too much than one can love too much;\nand if it is a heresy to pray beyond the texts, Saint Theresa and Saint\nJerome would be heretics.\n\nHe inclined towards all that groans and all that expiates. The universe\nappeared to him like an immense malady; everywhere he felt fever,\neverywhere he heard the sound of suffering, and, without seeking to\nsolve the enigma, he strove to dress the wound. The terrible spectacle\nof created things developed tenderness in him; he was occupied only\nin finding for himself, and in inspiring others with the best way to\ncompassionate and relieve. That which exists was for this good and rare\npriest a permanent subject of sadness which sought consolation.\n\nThere are men who toil at extracting gold; he toiled at the extraction\nof pity. Universal misery was his mine. The sadness which reigned\neverywhere was but an excuse for unfailing kindness. Love each other; he\ndeclared this to be complete, desired nothing further, and that was the\nwhole of his doctrine. One day, that man who believed himself to be a\n\"philosopher,\" the senator who has already been alluded to, said to the\nBishop: \"Just survey the spectacle of the world: all war against\nall; the strongest has the most wit. Your love each other is\nnonsense.\"--\"Well,\" replied Monseigneur Welcome, without contesting the\npoint, \"if it is nonsense, the soul should shut itself up in it, as the\npearl in the oyster.\" Thus he shut himself up, he lived there, he\nwas absolutely satisfied with it, leaving on one side the prodigious\nquestions which attract and terrify, the fathomless perspectives of\nabstraction, the precipices of metaphysics--all those profundities\nwhich converge, for the apostle in God, for the atheist in nothingness;\ndestiny, good and evil, the way of being against being, the conscience\nof man, the thoughtful somnambulism of the animal, the transformation\nin death, the recapitulation of existences which the tomb contains, the\nincomprehensible grafting of successive loves on the persistent _I_,\nthe essence, the substance, the Nile, and the Ens, the soul, nature,\nliberty, necessity; perpendicular problems, sinister obscurities, where\nlean the gigantic archangels of the human mind; formidable abysses,\nwhich Lucretius, Manou, Saint Paul, Dante, contemplate with eyes\nflashing lightning, which seems by its steady gaze on the infinite to\ncause stars to blaze forth there.\n\nMonseigneur Bienvenu was simply a man who took note of the exterior of\nmysterious questions without scrutinizing them, and without troubling\nhis own mind with them, and who cherished in his own soul a grave\nrespect for darkness.\n\n\n\n\nBOOK SECOND--THE FALL\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I--THE EVENING OF A DAY OF WALKING\n\nEarly in the month of October, 1815, about an hour before sunset, a\nman who was travelling on foot entered the little town of D----The few\ninhabitants who were at their windows or on their thresholds at the\nmoment stared at this traveller with a sort of uneasiness. It was\ndifficult to encounter a wayfarer of more wretched appearance. He was\na man of medium stature, thickset and robust, in the prime of life.\nHe might have been forty-six or forty-eight years old. A cap with a\ndrooping leather visor partly concealed his face, burned and tanned by\nsun and wind, and dripping with perspiration. His shirt of coarse yellow\nlinen, fastened at the neck by a small silver anchor, permitted a view\nof his hairy breast: he had a cravat twisted into a string; trousers of\nblue drilling, worn and threadbare, white on one knee and torn on the\nother; an old gray, tattered blouse, patched on one of the elbows with\na bit of green cloth sewed on with twine; a tightly packed soldier\nknapsack, well buckled and perfectly new, on his back; an enormous,\nknotty stick in his hand; iron-shod shoes on his stockingless feet; a\nshaved head and a long beard.\n\nThe sweat, the heat, the journey on foot, the dust, added I know not\nwhat sordid quality to this dilapidated whole. His hair was closely cut,\nyet bristling, for it had begun to grow a little, and did not seem to\nhave been cut for some time.\n\nNo one knew him. He was evidently only a chance passer-by. Whence came\nhe? From the south; from the seashore, perhaps, for he made his entrance\ninto D---- by the same street which, seven months previously, had\nwitnessed the passage of the Emperor Napoleon on his way from Cannes\nto Paris. This man must have been walking all day. He seemed very much\nfatigued. Some women of the ancient market town which is situated below\nthe city had seen him pause beneath the trees of the boulevard Gassendi,\nand drink at the fountain which stands at the end of the promenade. He\nmust have been very thirsty: for the children who followed him saw him\nstop again for a drink, two hundred paces further on, at the fountain in\nthe market-place.\n\nOn arriving at the corner of the Rue Poichevert, he turned to the left,\nand directed his steps toward the town-hall. He entered, then came out\na quarter of an hour later. A gendarme was seated near the door, on the\nstone bench which General Drouot had mounted on the 4th of March to read\nto the frightened throng of the inhabitants of D---- the proclamation\nof the Gulf Juan. The man pulled off his cap and humbly saluted the\ngendarme.\n\nThe gendarme, without replying to his salute, stared attentively at him,\nfollowed him for a while with his eyes, and then entered the town-hall.\n\nThere then existed at D---- a fine inn at the sign of the Cross of\nColbas. This inn had for a landlord a certain Jacquin Labarre, a man\nof consideration in the town on account of his relationship to another\nLabarre, who kept the inn of the Three Dauphins in Grenoble, and had\nserved in the Guides. At the time of the Emperor's landing, many rumors\nhad circulated throughout the country with regard to this inn of the\nThree Dauphins. It was said that General Bertrand, disguised as a\ncarter, had made frequent trips thither in the month of January, and\nthat he had distributed crosses of honor to the soldiers and handfuls\nof gold to the citizens. The truth is, that when the Emperor entered\nGrenoble he had refused to install himself at the hotel of the\nprefecture; he had thanked the mayor, saying, \"I am going to the house\nof a brave man of my acquaintance\"; and he had betaken himself to the\nThree Dauphins. This glory of the Labarre of the Three Dauphins was\nreflected upon the Labarre of the Cross of Colbas, at a distance of five\nand twenty leagues. It was said of him in the town, \"That is the cousin\nof the man of Grenoble.\"\n\nThe man bent his steps towards this inn, which was the best in the\ncountry-side. He entered the kitchen, which opened on a level with the\nstreet. All the stoves were lighted; a huge fire blazed gayly in the\nfireplace. The host, who was also the chief cook, was going from one\nstew-pan to another, very busily superintending an excellent dinner\ndesigned for the wagoners, whose loud talking, conversation, and\nlaughter were audible from an adjoining apartment. Any one who has\ntravelled knows that there is no one who indulges in better cheer than\nwagoners. A fat marmot, flanked by white partridges and heather-cocks,\nwas turning on a long spit before the fire; on the stove, two huge carps\nfrom Lake Lauzet and a trout from Lake Alloz were cooking.\n\nThe host, hearing the door open and seeing a newcomer enter, said,\nwithout raising his eyes from his stoves:--\n\n\"What do you wish, sir?\"\n\n\"Food and lodging,\" said the man.\n\n\"Nothing easier,\" replied the host. At that moment he turned his head,\ntook in the traveller's appearance with a single glance, and added, \"By\npaying for it.\"\n\nThe man drew a large leather purse from the pocket of his blouse, and\nanswered, \"I have money.\"\n\n\"In that case, we are at your service,\" said the host.\n\nThe man put his purse back in his pocket, removed his knapsack from\nhis back, put it on the ground near the door, retained his stick in his\nhand, and seated himself on a low stool close to the fire. D---- is in\nthe mountains. The evenings are cold there in October.\n\nBut as the host went back and forth, he scrutinized the traveller.\n\n\"Will dinner be ready soon?\" said the man.\n\n\"Immediately,\" replied the landlord.\n\nWhile the newcomer was warming himself before the fire, with his back\nturned, the worthy host, Jacquin Labarre, drew a pencil from his pocket,\nthen tore off the corner of an old newspaper which was lying on a small\ntable near the window. On the white margin he wrote a line or two,\nfolded it without sealing, and then intrusted this scrap of paper to\na child who seemed to serve him in the capacity both of scullion and\nlackey. The landlord whispered a word in the scullion's ear, and the\nchild set off on a run in the direction of the town-hall.\n\nThe traveller saw nothing of all this.\n\nOnce more he inquired, \"Will dinner be ready soon?\"\n\n\"Immediately,\" responded the host.\n\nThe child returned. He brought back the paper. The host unfolded it\neagerly, like a person who is expecting a reply. He seemed to read it\nattentively, then tossed his head, and remained thoughtful for a moment.\nThen he took a step in the direction of the traveller, who appeared to\nbe immersed in reflections which were not very serene.\n\n\"I cannot receive you, sir,\" said he.\n\nThe man half rose.\n\n\"What! Are you afraid that I will not pay you? Do you want me to pay you\nin advance? I have money, I tell you.\"\n\n\"It is not that.\"\n\n\"What then?\"\n\n\"You have money--\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said the man.\n\n\"And I,\" said the host, \"have no room.\"\n\nThe man resumed tranquilly, \"Put me in the stable.\"\n\n\"I cannot.\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"The horses take up all the space.\"\n\n\"Very well!\" retorted the man; \"a corner of the loft then, a truss of\nstraw. We will see about that after dinner.\"\n\n\"I cannot give you any dinner.\"\n\nThis declaration, made in a measured but firm tone, struck the stranger\nas grave. He rose.\n\n\"Ah! bah! But I am dying of hunger. I have been walking since sunrise. I\nhave travelled twelve leagues. I pay. I wish to eat.\"\n\n\"I have nothing,\" said the landlord.\n\nThe man burst out laughing, and turned towards the fireplace and the\nstoves: \"Nothing! and all that?\"\n\n\"All that is engaged.\"\n\n\"By whom?\"\n\n\"By messieurs the wagoners.\"\n\n\"How many are there of them?\"\n\n\"Twelve.\"\n\n\"There is enough food there for twenty.\"\n\n\"They have engaged the whole of it and paid for it in advance.\"\n\nThe man seated himself again, and said, without raising his voice, \"I am\nat an inn; I am hungry, and I shall remain.\"\n\nThen the host bent down to his ear, and said in a tone which made him\nstart, \"Go away!\"\n\nAt that moment the traveller was bending forward and thrusting some\nbrands into the fire with the iron-shod tip of his staff; he turned\nquickly round, and as he opened his mouth to reply, the host gazed\nsteadily at him and added, still in a low voice: \"Stop! there's enough\nof that sort of talk. Do you want me to tell you your name? Your name is\nJean Valjean. Now do you want me to tell you who you are? When I saw you\ncome in I suspected something; I sent to the town-hall, and this was the\nreply that was sent to me. Can you read?\"\n\nSo saying, he held out to the stranger, fully unfolded, the paper which\nhad just travelled from the inn to the town-hall, and from the town-hall\nto the inn. The man cast a glance upon it. The landlord resumed after a\npause.\n\n\"I am in the habit of being polite to every one. Go away!\"\n\nThe man dropped his head, picked up the knapsack which he had deposited\non the ground, and took his departure.\n\nHe chose the principal street. He walked straight on at a venture,\nkeeping close to the houses like a sad and humiliated man. He did not\nturn round a single time. Had he done so, he would have seen the host\nof the Cross of Colbas standing on his threshold, surrounded by all\nthe guests of his inn, and all the passers-by in the street, talking\nvivaciously, and pointing him out with his finger; and, from the glances\nof terror and distrust cast by the group, he might have divined that his\narrival would speedily become an event for the whole town.\n\nHe saw nothing of all this. People who are crushed do not look behind\nthem. They know but too well the evil fate which follows them.\n\nThus he proceeded for some time, walking on without ceasing, traversing\nat random streets of which he knew nothing, forgetful of his fatigue,\nas is often the case when a man is sad. All at once he felt the pangs\nof hunger sharply. Night was drawing near. He glanced about him, to see\nwhether he could not discover some shelter.\n\nThe fine hostelry was closed to him; he was seeking some very humble\npublic house, some hovel, however lowly.\n\nJust then a light flashed up at the end of the streets; a pine branch\nsuspended from a cross-beam of iron was outlined against the white sky\nof the twilight. He proceeded thither.\n\nIt proved to be, in fact, a public house. The public house which is in\nthe Rue de Chaffaut.\n\nThe wayfarer halted for a moment, and peeped through the window into the\ninterior of the low-studded room of the public house, illuminated by a\nsmall lamp on a table and by a large fire on the hearth. Some men were\nengaged in drinking there. The landlord was warming himself. An iron\npot, suspended from a crane, bubbled over the flame.\n\nThe entrance to this public house, which is also a sort of an inn, is by\ntwo doors. One opens on the street, the other upon a small yard filled\nwith manure. The traveller dare not enter by the street door. He slipped\ninto the yard, halted again, then raised the latch timidly and opened\nthe door.\n\n\"Who goes there?\" said the master.\n\n\"Some one who wants supper and bed.\"\n\n\"Good. We furnish supper and bed here.\"\n\nHe entered. All the men who were drinking turned round. The lamp\nilluminated him on one side, the firelight on the other. They examined\nhim for some time while he was taking off his knapsack.\n\nThe host said to him, \"There is the fire. The supper is cooking in the\npot. Come and warm yourself, comrade.\"\n\nHe approached and seated himself near the hearth. He stretched out his\nfeet, which were exhausted with fatigue, to the fire; a fine odor was\nemitted by the pot. All that could be distinguished of his face, beneath\nhis cap, which was well pulled down, assumed a vague appearance\nof comfort, mingled with that other poignant aspect which habitual\nsuffering bestows.\n\nIt was, moreover, a firm, energetic, and melancholy profile. This\nphysiognomy was strangely composed; it began by seeming humble, and\nended by seeming severe. The eye shone beneath its lashes like a fire\nbeneath brushwood.\n\nOne of the men seated at the table, however, was a fishmonger who,\nbefore entering the public house of the Rue de Chaffaut, had been to\nstable his horse at Labarre's. It chanced that he had that very morning\nencountered this unprepossessing stranger on the road between Bras\nd'Asse and--I have forgotten the name. I think it was Escoublon. Now,\nwhen he met him, the man, who then seemed already extremely weary, had\nrequested him to take him on his crupper; to which the fishmonger had\nmade no reply except by redoubling his gait. This fishmonger had been\na member half an hour previously of the group which surrounded Jacquin\nLabarre, and had himself related his disagreeable encounter of the\nmorning to the people at the Cross of Colbas. From where he sat he made\nan imperceptible sign to the tavern-keeper. The tavern-keeper went to\nhim. They exchanged a few words in a low tone. The man had again become\nabsorbed in his reflections.\n\nThe tavern-keeper returned to the fireplace, laid his hand abruptly on\nthe shoulder of the man, and said to him:--\n\n\"You are going to get out of here.\"\n\nThe stranger turned round and replied gently, \"Ah! You know?--\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"I was sent away from the other inn.\"\n\n\"And you are to be turned out of this one.\"\n\n\"Where would you have me go?\"\n\n\"Elsewhere.\"\n\nThe man took his stick and his knapsack and departed.\n\nAs he went out, some children who had followed him from the Cross of\nColbas, and who seemed to be lying in wait for him, threw stones at him.\nHe retraced his steps in anger, and threatened them with his stick: the\nchildren dispersed like a flock of birds.\n\nHe passed before the prison. At the door hung an iron chain attached to\na bell. He rang.\n\nThe wicket opened.\n\n\"Turnkey,\" said he, removing his cap politely, \"will you have the\nkindness to admit me, and give me a lodging for the night?\"\n\nA voice replied:--\n\n\"The prison is not an inn. Get yourself arrested, and you will be\nadmitted.\"\n\nThe wicket closed again.\n\nHe entered a little street in which there were many gardens. Some of\nthem are enclosed only by hedges, which lends a cheerful aspect to the\nstreet. In the midst of these gardens and hedges he caught sight of a\nsmall house of a single story, the window of which was lighted up. He\npeered through the pane as he had done at the public house. Within was a\nlarge whitewashed room, with a bed draped in printed cotton stuff, and\na cradle in one corner, a few wooden chairs, and a double-barrelled gun\nhanging on the wall. A table was spread in the centre of the room. A\ncopper lamp illuminated the tablecloth of coarse white linen, the pewter\njug shining like silver, and filled with wine, and the brown, smoking\nsoup-tureen. At this table sat a man of about forty, with a merry and\nopen countenance, who was dandling a little child on his knees. Close by\na very young woman was nursing another child. The father was laughing,\nthe child was laughing, the mother was smiling.\n\nThe stranger paused a moment in revery before this tender and calming\nspectacle. What was taking place within him? He alone could have\ntold. It is probable that he thought that this joyous house would be\nhospitable, and that, in a place where he beheld so much happiness, he\nwould find perhaps a little pity.\n\nHe tapped on the pane with a very small and feeble knock.\n\nThey did not hear him.\n\nHe tapped again.\n\nHe heard the woman say, \"It seems to me, husband, that some one is\nknocking.\"\n\n\"No,\" replied the husband.\n\nHe tapped a third time.\n\nThe husband rose, took the lamp, and went to the door, which he opened.\n\nHe was a man of lofty stature, half peasant, half artisan. He wore a\nhuge leather apron, which reached to his left shoulder, and which a\nhammer, a red handkerchief, a powder-horn, and all sorts of objects\nwhich were upheld by the girdle, as in a pocket, caused to bulge out. He\ncarried his head thrown backwards; his shirt, widely opened and turned\nback, displayed his bull neck, white and bare. He had thick eyelashes,\nenormous black whiskers, prominent eyes, the lower part of his face\nlike a snout; and besides all this, that air of being on his own ground,\nwhich is indescribable.\n\n\"Pardon me, sir,\" said the wayfarer, \"Could you, in consideration of\npayment, give me a plate of soup and a corner of that shed yonder in the\ngarden, in which to sleep? Tell me; can you? For money?\"\n\n\"Who are you?\" demanded the master of the house.\n\nThe man replied: \"I have just come from Puy-Moisson. I have walked all\nday long. I have travelled twelve leagues. Can you?--if I pay?\"\n\n\"I would not refuse,\" said the peasant, \"to lodge any respectable man\nwho would pay me. But why do you not go to the inn?\"\n\n\"There is no room.\"\n\n\"Bah! Impossible. This is neither a fair nor a market day. Have you been\nto Labarre?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Well?\"\n\nThe traveller replied with embarrassment: \"I do not know. He did not\nreceive me.\"\n\n\"Have you been to What's-his-name's, in the Rue Chaffaut?\"\n\nThe stranger's embarrassment increased; he stammered, \"He did not\nreceive me either.\"\n\nThe peasant's countenance assumed an expression of distrust; he surveyed\nthe newcomer from head to feet, and suddenly exclaimed, with a sort of\nshudder:--\n\n\"Are you the man?--\"\n\nHe cast a fresh glance upon the stranger, took three steps backwards,\nplaced the lamp on the table, and took his gun down from the wall.\n\nMeanwhile, at the words, Are you the man? the woman had risen, had\nclasped her two children in her arms, and had taken refuge precipitately\nbehind her husband, staring in terror at the stranger, with her bosom\nuncovered, and with frightened eyes, as she murmured in a low tone,\n\"Tso-maraude.\"[1]\n\nAll this took place in less time than it requires to picture it to\none's self. After having scrutinized the man for several moments, as one\nscrutinizes a viper, the master of the house returned to the door and\nsaid:--\n\n\"Clear out!\"\n\n\"For pity's sake, a glass of water,\" said the man.\n\n\"A shot from my gun!\" said the peasant.\n\nThen he closed the door violently, and the man heard him shoot two large\nbolts. A moment later, the window-shutter was closed, and the sound of a\nbar of iron which was placed against it was audible outside.\n\nNight continued to fall. A cold wind from the Alps was blowing. By the\nlight of the expiring day the stranger perceived, in one of the gardens\nwhich bordered the street, a sort of hut, which seemed to him to be\nbuilt of sods. He climbed over the wooden fence resolutely, and found\nhimself in the garden. He approached the hut; its door consisted of a\nvery low and narrow aperture, and it resembled those buildings which\nroad-laborers construct for themselves along the roads. He thought\nwithout doubt, that it was, in fact, the dwelling of a road-laborer; he\nwas suffering from cold and hunger, but this was, at least, a shelter\nfrom the cold. This sort of dwelling is not usually occupied at night.\nHe threw himself flat on his face, and crawled into the hut. It was warm\nthere, and he found a tolerably good bed of straw. He lay, for a moment,\nstretched out on this bed, without the power to make a movement, so\nfatigued was he. Then, as the knapsack on his back was in his way, and\nas it furnished, moreover, a pillow ready to his hand, he set about\nunbuckling one of the straps. At that moment, a ferocious growl became\naudible. He raised his eyes. The head of an enormous dog was outlined in\nthe darkness at the entrance of the hut.\n\nIt was a dog's kennel.\n\nHe was himself vigorous and formidable; he armed himself with his staff,\nmade a shield of his knapsack, and made his way out of the kennel in the\nbest way he could, not without enlarging the rents in his rags.\n\nHe left the garden in the same manner, but backwards, being obliged,\nin order to keep the dog respectful, to have recourse to that manoeuvre\nwith his stick which masters in that sort of fencing designate as la\nrose couverte.\n\nWhen he had, not without difficulty, repassed the fence, and found\nhimself once more in the street, alone, without refuge, without shelter,\nwithout a roof over his head, chased even from that bed of straw and\nfrom that miserable kennel, he dropped rather than seated himself on a\nstone, and it appears that a passer-by heard him exclaim, \"I am not even\na dog!\"\n\nHe soon rose again and resumed his march. He went out of the town,\nhoping to find some tree or haystack in the fields which would afford\nhim shelter.\n\nHe walked thus for some time, with his head still drooping. When he felt\nhimself far from every human habitation, he raised his eyes and gazed\nsearchingly about him. He was in a field. Before him was one of those\nlow hills covered with close-cut stubble, which, after the harvest,\nresemble shaved heads.\n\nThe horizon was perfectly black. This was not alone the obscurity of\nnight; it was caused by very low-hanging clouds which seemed to rest\nupon the hill itself, and which were mounting and filling the whole\nsky. Meanwhile, as the moon was about to rise, and as there was still\nfloating in the zenith a remnant of the brightness of twilight, these\nclouds formed at the summit of the sky a sort of whitish arch, whence a\ngleam of light fell upon the earth.\n\nThe earth was thus better lighted than the sky, which produces a\nparticularly sinister effect, and the hill, whose contour was poor and\nmean, was outlined vague and wan against the gloomy horizon. The whole\neffect was hideous, petty, lugubrious, and narrow.\n\nThere was nothing in the field or on the hill except a deformed tree,\nwhich writhed and shivered a few paces distant from the wayfarer.\n\nThis man was evidently very far from having those delicate habits of\nintelligence and spirit which render one sensible to the mysterious\naspects of things; nevertheless, there was something in that sky,\nin that hill, in that plain, in that tree, which was so profoundly\ndesolate, that after a moment of immobility and revery he turned back\nabruptly. There are instants when nature seems hostile.\n\nHe retraced his steps; the gates of D---- were closed. D----, which had\nsustained sieges during the wars of religion, was still surrounded\nin 1815 by ancient walls flanked by square towers which have been\ndemolished since. He passed through a breach and entered the town again.\n\nIt might have been eight o'clock in the evening. As he was not\nacquainted with the streets, he recommenced his walk at random.\n\nIn this way he came to the prefecture, then to the seminary. As he\npassed through the Cathedral Square, he shook his fist at the church.\n\nAt the corner of this square there is a printing establishment. It is\nthere that the proclamations of the Emperor and of the Imperial Guard\nto the army, brought from the Island of Elba and dictated by Napoleon\nhimself, were printed for the first time.\n\nWorn out with fatigue, and no longer entertaining any hope, he lay down\non a stone bench which stands at the doorway of this printing office.\n\nAt that moment an old woman came out of the church. She saw the man\nstretched out in the shadow. \"What are you doing there, my friend?\" said\nshe.\n\nHe answered harshly and angrily: \"As you see, my good woman, I am\nsleeping.\" The good woman, who was well worthy the name, in fact, was\nthe Marquise de R----\n\n\"On this bench?\" she went on.\n\n\"I have had a mattress of wood for nineteen years,\" said the man;\n\"to-day I have a mattress of stone.\"\n\n\"You have been a soldier?\"\n\n\"Yes, my good woman, a soldier.\"\n\n\"Why do you not go to the inn?\"\n\n\"Because I have no money.\"\n\n\"Alas!\" said Madame de R----, \"I have only four sous in my purse.\"\n\n\"Give it to me all the same.\"\n\nThe man took the four sous. Madame de R---- continued: \"You cannot\nobtain lodgings in an inn for so small a sum. But have you tried? It is\nimpossible for you to pass the night thus. You are cold and hungry, no\ndoubt. Some one might have given you a lodging out of charity.\"\n\n\"I have knocked at all doors.\"\n\n\"Well?\"\n\n\"I have been driven away everywhere.\"\n\nThe \"good woman\" touched the man's arm, and pointed out to him on the\nother side of the street a small, low house, which stood beside the\nBishop's palace.\n\n\"You have knocked at all doors?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Have you knocked at that one?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Knock there.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II--PRUDENCE COUNSELLED TO WISDOM.\n\nThat evening, the Bishop of D----, after his promenade through the town,\nremained shut up rather late in his room. He was busy over a great work\non Duties, which was never completed, unfortunately. He was carefully\ncompiling everything that the Fathers and the doctors have said on this\nimportant subject. His book was divided into two parts: firstly, the\nduties of all; secondly, the duties of each individual, according to the\nclass to which he belongs. The duties of all are the great duties. There\nare four of these. Saint Matthew points them out: duties towards God\n(Matt. vi.); duties towards one's self (Matt. v. 29, 30); duties towards\none's neighbor (Matt. vii. 12); duties towards animals (Matt. vi. 20,\n25). As for the other duties the Bishop found them pointed out and\nprescribed elsewhere: to sovereigns and subjects, in the Epistle to the\nRomans; to magistrates, to wives, to mothers, to young men, by Saint\nPeter; to husbands, fathers, children and servants, in the Epistle\nto the Ephesians; to the faithful, in the Epistle to the Hebrews; to\nvirgins, in the Epistle to the Corinthians. Out of these precepts he was\nlaboriously constructing a harmonious whole, which he desired to present\nto souls.\n\nAt eight o'clock he was still at work, writing with a good deal of\ninconvenience upon little squares of paper, with a big book open on his\nknees, when Madame Magloire entered, according to her wont, to get the\nsilver-ware from the cupboard near his bed. A moment later, the Bishop,\nknowing that the table was set, and that his sister was probably\nwaiting for him, shut his book, rose from his table, and entered the\ndining-room.\n\nThe dining-room was an oblong apartment, with a fireplace, which had a\ndoor opening on the street (as we have said), and a window opening on\nthe garden.\n\nMadame Magloire was, in fact, just putting the last touches to the\ntable.\n\nAs she performed this service, she was conversing with Mademoiselle\nBaptistine.\n\nA lamp stood on the table; the table was near the fireplace. A wood fire\nwas burning there.\n\nOne can easily picture to one's self these two women, both of whom\nwere over sixty years of age. Madame Magloire small, plump, vivacious;\nMademoiselle Baptistine gentle, slender, frail, somewhat taller than her\nbrother, dressed in a gown of puce-colored silk, of the fashion of 1806,\nwhich she had purchased at that date in Paris, and which had lasted\never since. To borrow vulgar phrases, which possess the merit of giving\nutterance in a single word to an idea which a whole page would hardly\nsuffice to express, Madame Magloire had the air of a peasant, and\nMademoiselle Baptistine that of a lady. Madame Magloire wore a white\nquilted cap, a gold Jeannette cross on a velvet ribbon upon her neck,\nthe only bit of feminine jewelry that there was in the house, a very\nwhite fichu puffing out from a gown of coarse black woollen stuff, with\nlarge, short sleeves, an apron of cotton cloth in red and green checks,\nknotted round the waist with a green ribbon, with a stomacher of the\nsame attached by two pins at the upper corners, coarse shoes on her\nfeet, and yellow stockings, like the women of Marseilles. Mademoiselle\nBaptistine's gown was cut on the patterns of 1806, with a short waist,\na narrow, sheath-like skirt, puffed sleeves, with flaps and buttons.\nShe concealed her gray hair under a frizzed wig known as the baby wig.\nMadame Magloire had an intelligent, vivacious, and kindly air; the two\ncorners of her mouth unequally raised, and her upper lip, which was\nlarger than the lower, imparted to her a rather crabbed and imperious\nlook. So long as Monseigneur held his peace, she talked to him\nresolutely with a mixture of respect and freedom; but as soon as\nMonseigneur began to speak, as we have seen, she obeyed passively like\nher mistress. Mademoiselle Baptistine did not even speak. She confined\nherself to obeying and pleasing him. She had never been pretty, even\nwhen she was young; she had large, blue, prominent eyes, and a long\narched nose; but her whole visage, her whole person, breathed forth an\nineffable goodness, as we stated in the beginning. She had always been\npredestined to gentleness; but faith, charity, hope, those three virtues\nwhich mildly warm the soul, had gradually elevated that gentleness to\nsanctity. Nature had made her a lamb, religion had made her an angel.\nPoor sainted virgin! Sweet memory which has vanished!\n\nMademoiselle Baptistine has so often narrated what passed at the\nepiscopal residence that evening, that there are many people now living\nwho still recall the most minute details.\n\nAt the moment when the Bishop entered, Madame Magloire was talking with\nconsiderable vivacity. She was haranguing Mademoiselle Baptistine on\na subject which was familiar to her and to which the Bishop was also\naccustomed. The question concerned the lock upon the entrance door.\n\nIt appears that while procuring some provisions for supper, Madame\nMagloire had heard things in divers places. People had spoken of a\nprowler of evil appearance; a suspicious vagabond had arrived who must\nbe somewhere about the town, and those who should take it into their\nheads to return home late that night might be subjected to unpleasant\nencounters. The police was very badly organized, moreover, because there\nwas no love lost between the Prefect and the Mayor, who sought to injure\neach other by making things happen. It behooved wise people to play the\npart of their own police, and to guard themselves well, and care must be\ntaken to duly close, bar and barricade their houses, and to fasten the\ndoors well.\n\nMadame Magloire emphasized these last words; but the Bishop had just\ncome from his room, where it was rather cold. He seated himself in front\nof the fire, and warmed himself, and then fell to thinking of other\nthings. He did not take up the remark dropped with design by Madame\nMagloire. She repeated it. Then Mademoiselle Baptistine, desirous of\nsatisfying Madame Magloire without displeasing her brother, ventured to\nsay timidly:--\n\n\"Did you hear what Madame Magloire is saying, brother?\"\n\n\"I have heard something of it in a vague way,\" replied the Bishop. Then\nhalf-turning in his chair, placing his hands on his knees, and raising\ntowards the old servant woman his cordial face, which so easily grew\njoyous, and which was illuminated from below by the firelight,--\"Come,\nwhat is the matter? What is the matter? Are we in any great danger?\"\n\nThen Madame Magloire began the whole story afresh, exaggerating it a\nlittle without being aware of the fact. It appeared that a Bohemian, a\nbare-footed vagabond, a sort of dangerous mendicant, was at that moment\nin the town. He had presented himself at Jacquin Labarre's to obtain\nlodgings, but the latter had not been willing to take him in. He had\nbeen seen to arrive by the way of the boulevard Gassendi and roam about\nthe streets in the gloaming. A gallows-bird with a terrible face.\n\n\"Really!\" said the Bishop.\n\nThis willingness to interrogate encouraged Madame Magloire; it seemed\nto her to indicate that the Bishop was on the point of becoming alarmed;\nshe pursued triumphantly:--\n\n\"Yes, Monseigneur. That is how it is. There will be some sort of\ncatastrophe in this town to-night. Every one says so. And withal, the\npolice is so badly regulated\" (a useful repetition). \"The idea of living\nin a mountainous country, and not even having lights in the streets at\nnight! One goes out. Black as ovens, indeed! And I say, Monseigneur, and\nMademoiselle there says with me--\"\n\n\"I,\" interrupted his sister, \"say nothing. What my brother does is well\ndone.\"\n\nMadame Magloire continued as though there had been no protest:--\n\n\"We say that this house is not safe at all; that if Monseigneur will\npermit, I will go and tell Paulin Musebois, the locksmith, to come and\nreplace the ancient locks on the doors; we have them, and it is only the\nwork of a moment; for I say that nothing is more terrible than a\ndoor which can be opened from the outside with a latch by the first\npasser-by; and I say that we need bolts, Monseigneur, if only for this\nnight; moreover, Monseigneur has the habit of always saying 'come in';\nand besides, even in the middle of the night, O mon Dieu! there is no\nneed to ask permission.\"\n\nAt that moment there came a tolerably violent knock on the door.\n\n\"Come in,\" said the Bishop.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III--THE HEROISM OF PASSIVE OBEDIENCE.\n\nThe door opened.\n\nIt opened wide with a rapid movement, as though some one had given it an\nenergetic and resolute push.\n\nA man entered.\n\nWe already know the man. It was the wayfarer whom we have seen wandering\nabout in search of shelter.\n\nHe entered, advanced a step, and halted, leaving the door open behind\nhim. He had his knapsack on his shoulders, his cudgel in his hand, a\nrough, audacious, weary, and violent expression in his eyes. The fire on\nthe hearth lighted him up. He was hideous. It was a sinister apparition.\n\nMadame Magloire had not even the strength to utter a cry. She trembled,\nand stood with her mouth wide open.\n\nMademoiselle Baptistine turned round, beheld the man entering, and half\nstarted up in terror; then, turning her head by degrees towards the\nfireplace again, she began to observe her brother, and her face became\nonce more profoundly calm and serene.\n\nThe Bishop fixed a tranquil eye on the man.\n\nAs he opened his mouth, doubtless to ask the new-comer what he desired,\nthe man rested both hands on his staff, directed his gaze at the old man\nand the two women, and without waiting for the Bishop to speak, he said,\nin a loud voice:--\n\n\"See here. My name is Jean Valjean. I am a convict from the galleys.\nI have passed nineteen years in the galleys. I was liberated four days\nago, and am on my way to Pontarlier, which is my destination. I have\nbeen walking for four days since I left Toulon. I have travelled a dozen\nleagues to-day on foot. This evening, when I arrived in these parts, I\nwent to an inn, and they turned me out, because of my yellow passport,\nwhich I had shown at the town-hall. I had to do it. I went to an inn.\nThey said to me, 'Be off,' at both places. No one would take me. I\nwent to the prison; the jailer would not admit me. I went into a dog's\nkennel; the dog bit me and chased me off, as though he had been a man.\nOne would have said that he knew who I was. I went into the fields,\nintending to sleep in the open air, beneath the stars. There were no\nstars. I thought it was going to rain, and I re-entered the town, to\nseek the recess of a doorway. Yonder, in the square, I meant to sleep\non a stone bench. A good woman pointed out your house to me, and said\nto me, 'Knock there!' I have knocked. What is this place? Do you keep\nan inn? I have money--savings. One hundred and nine francs fifteen sous,\nwhich I earned in the galleys by my labor, in the course of nineteen\nyears. I will pay. What is that to me? I have money. I am very weary;\ntwelve leagues on foot; I am very hungry. Are you willing that I should\nremain?\"\n\n\"Madame Magloire,\" said the Bishop, \"you will set another place.\"\n\nThe man advanced three paces, and approached the lamp which was on\nthe table. \"Stop,\" he resumed, as though he had not quite understood;\n\"that's not it. Did you hear? I am a galley-slave; a convict. I come\nfrom the galleys.\" He drew from his pocket a large sheet of yellow\npaper, which he unfolded. \"Here's my passport. Yellow, as you see. This\nserves to expel me from every place where I go. Will you read it? I know\nhow to read. I learned in the galleys. There is a school there for those\nwho choose to learn. Hold, this is what they put on this passport: 'Jean\nValjean, discharged convict, native of'--that is nothing to you--'has\nbeen nineteen years in the galleys: five years for house-breaking\nand burglary; fourteen years for having attempted to escape on four\noccasions. He is a very dangerous man.' There! Every one has cast me\nout. Are you willing to receive me? Is this an inn? Will you give me\nsomething to eat and a bed? Have you a stable?\"\n\n\"Madame Magloire,\" said the Bishop, \"you will put white sheets on the\nbed in the alcove.\" We have already explained the character of the two\nwomen's obedience.\n\nMadame Magloire retired to execute these orders.\n\nThe Bishop turned to the man.\n\n\"Sit down, sir, and warm yourself. We are going to sup in a few moments,\nand your bed will be prepared while you are supping.\"\n\nAt this point the man suddenly comprehended. The expression of his face,\nup to that time sombre and harsh, bore the imprint of stupefaction,\nof doubt, of joy, and became extraordinary. He began stammering like a\ncrazy man:--\n\n\"Really? What! You will keep me? You do not drive me forth? A convict!\nYou call me sir! You do not address me as thou? 'Get out of here, you\ndog!' is what people always say to me. I felt sure that you would expel\nme, so I told you at once who I am. Oh, what a good woman that was who\ndirected me hither! I am going to sup! A bed with a mattress and sheets,\nlike the rest of the world! a bed! It is nineteen years since I have\nslept in a bed! You actually do not want me to go! You are good\npeople. Besides, I have money. I will pay well. Pardon me, monsieur the\ninn-keeper, but what is your name? I will pay anything you ask. You are\na fine man. You are an inn-keeper, are you not?\"\n\n\"I am,\" replied the Bishop, \"a priest who lives here.\"\n\n\"A priest!\" said the man. \"Oh, what a fine priest! Then you are not\ngoing to demand any money of me? You are the cure, are you not? the cure\nof this big church? Well! I am a fool, truly! I had not perceived your\nskull-cap.\"\n\nAs he spoke, he deposited his knapsack and his cudgel in a corner,\nreplaced his passport in his pocket, and seated himself. Mademoiselle\nBaptistine gazed mildly at him. He continued:\n\n\"You are humane, Monsieur le Cure; you have not scorned me. A good\npriest is a very good thing. Then you do not require me to pay?\"\n\n\"No,\" said the Bishop; \"keep your money. How much have you? Did you not\ntell me one hundred and nine francs?\"\n\n\"And fifteen sous,\" added the man.\n\n\"One hundred and nine francs fifteen sous. And how long did it take you\nto earn that?\"\n\n\"Nineteen years.\"\n\n\"Nineteen years!\"\n\nThe Bishop sighed deeply.\n\nThe man continued: \"I have still the whole of my money. In four days I\nhave spent only twenty-five sous, which I earned by helping unload some\nwagons at Grasse. Since you are an abbe, I will tell you that we had a\nchaplain in the galleys. And one day I saw a bishop there. Monseigneur\nis what they call him. He was the Bishop of Majore at Marseilles. He is\nthe cure who rules over the other cures, you understand. Pardon me,\nI say that very badly; but it is such a far-off thing to me! You\nunderstand what we are! He said mass in the middle of the galleys, on an\naltar. He had a pointed thing, made of gold, on his head; it glittered\nin the bright light of midday. We were all ranged in lines on the three\nsides, with cannons with lighted matches facing us. We could not see\nvery well. He spoke; but he was too far off, and we did not hear. That\nis what a bishop is like.\"\n\nWhile he was speaking, the Bishop had gone and shut the door, which had\nremained wide open.\n\nMadame Magloire returned. She brought a silver fork and spoon, which she\nplaced on the table.\n\n\"Madame Magloire,\" said the Bishop, \"place those things as near the fire\nas possible.\" And turning to his guest: \"The night wind is harsh on the\nAlps. You must be cold, sir.\"\n\nEach time that he uttered the word sir, in his voice which was so gently\ngrave and polished, the man's face lighted up. Monsieur to a convict is\nlike a glass of water to one of the shipwrecked of the Medusa. Ignominy\nthirsts for consideration.\n\n\"This lamp gives a very bad light,\" said the Bishop.\n\nMadame Magloire understood him, and went to get the two silver\ncandlesticks from the chimney-piece in Monseigneur's bed-chamber, and\nplaced them, lighted, on the table.\n\n\"Monsieur le Cure,\" said the man, \"you are good; you do not despise me.\nYou receive me into your house. You light your candles for me. Yet I\nhave not concealed from you whence I come and that I am an unfortunate\nman.\"\n\nThe Bishop, who was sitting close to him, gently touched his hand. \"You\ncould not help telling me who you were. This is not my house; it is\nthe house of Jesus Christ. This door does not demand of him who enters\nwhether he has a name, but whether he has a grief. You suffer, you are\nhungry and thirsty; you are welcome. And do not thank me; do not say\nthat I receive you in my house. No one is at home here, except the man\nwho needs a refuge. I say to you, who are passing by, that you are much\nmore at home here than I am myself. Everything here is yours. What need\nhave I to know your name? Besides, before you told me you had one which\nI knew.\"\n\nThe man opened his eyes in astonishment.\n\n\"Really? You knew what I was called?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" replied the Bishop, \"you are called my brother.\"\n\n\"Stop, Monsieur le Cure,\" exclaimed the man. \"I was very hungry when\nI entered here; but you are so good, that I no longer know what has\nhappened to me.\"\n\nThe Bishop looked at him, and said,--\n\n\"You have suffered much?\"\n\n\"Oh, the red coat, the ball on the ankle, a plank to sleep on, heat,\ncold, toil, the convicts, the thrashings, the double chain for nothing,\nthe cell for one word; even sick and in bed, still the chain! Dogs, dogs\nare happier! Nineteen years! I am forty-six. Now there is the yellow\npassport. That is what it is like.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" resumed the Bishop, \"you have come from a very sad place.\nListen. There will be more joy in heaven over the tear-bathed face of a\nrepentant sinner than over the white robes of a hundred just men. If you\nemerge from that sad place with thoughts of hatred and of wrath against\nmankind, you are deserving of pity; if you emerge with thoughts of\ngood-will and of peace, you are more worthy than any one of us.\"\n\nIn the meantime, Madame Magloire had served supper: soup, made with\nwater, oil, bread, and salt; a little bacon, a bit of mutton, figs, a\nfresh cheese, and a large loaf of rye bread. She had, of her own accord,\nadded to the Bishop's ordinary fare a bottle of his old Mauves wine.\n\nThe Bishop's face at once assumed that expression of gayety which is\npeculiar to hospitable natures. \"To table!\" he cried vivaciously. As was\nhis custom when a stranger supped with him, he made the man sit on his\nright. Mademoiselle Baptistine, perfectly peaceable and natural, took\nher seat at his left.\n\nThe Bishop asked a blessing; then helped the soup himself, according to\nhis custom. The man began to eat with avidity.\n\nAll at once the Bishop said: \"It strikes me there is something missing\non this table.\"\n\nMadame Magloire had, in fact, only placed the three sets of forks and\nspoons which were absolutely necessary. Now, it was the usage of the\nhouse, when the Bishop had any one to supper, to lay out the whole\nsix sets of silver on the table-cloth--an innocent ostentation. This\ngraceful semblance of luxury was a kind of child's play, which was full\nof charm in that gentle and severe household, which raised poverty into\ndignity.\n\nMadame Magloire understood the remark, went out without saying a word,\nand a moment later the three sets of silver forks and spoons demanded by\nthe Bishop were glittering upon the cloth, symmetrically arranged before\nthe three persons seated at the table.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV--DETAILS CONCERNING THE CHEESE-DAIRIES OF PONTARLIER.\n\nNow, in order to convey an idea of what passed at that table, we cannot\ndo better than to transcribe here a passage from one of Mademoiselle\nBaptistine's letters to Madame Boischevron, wherein the conversation\nbetween the convict and the Bishop is described with ingenious\nminuteness.\n\n\n\". . . This man paid no attention to any one. He ate with the voracity\nof a starving man. However, after supper he said:\n\n\"'Monsieur le Cure of the good God, all this is far too good for me; but\nI must say that the carters who would not allow me to eat with them keep\na better table than you do.'\n\n\"Between ourselves, the remark rather shocked me. My brother replied:--\n\n\"'They are more fatigued than I.'\n\n\"'No,' returned the man, 'they have more money. You are poor; I see that\nplainly. You cannot be even a curate. Are you really a cure? Ah, if the\ngood God were but just, you certainly ought to be a cure!'\n\n\"'The good God is more than just,' said my brother.\n\n\"A moment later he added:--\n\n\"'Monsieur Jean Valjean, is it to Pontarlier that you are going?'\n\n\"'With my road marked out for me.'\n\n\"I think that is what the man said. Then he went on:--\n\n\"'I must be on my way by daybreak to-morrow. Travelling is hard. If the\nnights are cold, the days are hot.'\n\n\"'You are going to a good country,' said my brother. 'During the\nRevolution my family was ruined. I took refuge in Franche-Comte at\nfirst, and there I lived for some time by the toil of my hands. My will\nwas good. I found plenty to occupy me. One has only to choose. There are\npaper mills, tanneries, distilleries, oil factories, watch factories\non a large scale, steel mills, copper works, twenty iron foundries at\nleast, four of which, situated at Lods, at Chatillon, at Audincourt, and\nat Beure, are tolerably large.'\n\n\"I think I am not mistaken in saying that those are the names which my\nbrother mentioned. Then he interrupted himself and addressed me:--\n\n\"'Have we not some relatives in those parts, my dear sister?'\n\n\"I replied,--\n\n\"'We did have some; among others, M. de Lucenet, who was captain of the\ngates at Pontarlier under the old regime.'\n\n\"'Yes,' resumed my brother; 'but in '93, one had no longer any\nrelatives, one had only one's arms. I worked. They have, in the\ncountry of Pontarlier, whither you are going, Monsieur Valjean, a\ntruly patriarchal and truly charming industry, my sister. It is their\ncheese-dairies, which they call fruitieres.'\n\n\"Then my brother, while urging the man to eat, explained to him, with\ngreat minuteness, what these fruitieres of Pontarlier were; that they\nwere divided into two classes: the big barns which belong to the rich,\nand where there are forty or fifty cows which produce from seven to\neight thousand cheeses each summer, and the associated fruitieres, which\nbelong to the poor; these are the peasants of mid-mountain, who hold\ntheir cows in common, and share the proceeds. 'They engage the services\nof a cheese-maker, whom they call the grurin; the grurin receives the\nmilk of the associates three times a day, and marks the quantity on\na double tally. It is towards the end of April that the work of the\ncheese-dairies begins; it is towards the middle of June that the\ncheese-makers drive their cows to the mountains.'\n\n\"The man recovered his animation as he ate. My brother made him drink\nthat good Mauves wine, which he does not drink himself, because he says\nthat wine is expensive. My brother imparted all these details with that\neasy gayety of his with which you are acquainted, interspersing his\nwords with graceful attentions to me. He recurred frequently to that\ncomfortable trade of grurin, as though he wished the man to understand,\nwithout advising him directly and harshly, that this would afford him\na refuge. One thing struck me. This man was what I have told you. Well,\nneither during supper, nor during the entire evening, did my brother\nutter a single word, with the exception of a few words about Jesus when\nhe entered, which could remind the man of what he was, nor of what my\nbrother was. To all appearances, it was an occasion for preaching him\na little sermon, and of impressing the Bishop on the convict, so that a\nmark of the passage might remain behind. This might have appeared to any\none else who had this, unfortunate man in his hands to afford a chance\nto nourish his soul as well as his body, and to bestow upon him\nsome reproach, seasoned with moralizing and advice, or a little\ncommiseration, with an exhortation to conduct himself better in the\nfuture. My brother did not even ask him from what country he came,\nnor what was his history. For in his history there is a fault, and my\nbrother seemed to avoid everything which could remind him of it. To such\na point did he carry it, that at one time, when my brother was speaking\nof the mountaineers of Pontarlier, who exercise a gentle labor near\nheaven, and who, he added, are happy because they are innocent, he\nstopped short, fearing lest in this remark there might have escaped him\nsomething which might wound the man. By dint of reflection, I think\nI have comprehended what was passing in my brother's heart. He was\nthinking, no doubt, that this man, whose name is Jean Valjean, had his\nmisfortune only too vividly present in his mind; that the best thing\nwas to divert him from it, and to make him believe, if only momentarily,\nthat he was a person like any other, by treating him just in his\nordinary way. Is not this indeed, to understand charity well? Is there\nnot, dear Madame, something truly evangelical in this delicacy which\nabstains from sermon, from moralizing, from allusions? and is not the\ntruest pity, when a man has a sore point, not to touch it at all? It has\nseemed to me that this might have been my brother's private thought. In\nany case, what I can say is that, if he entertained all these ideas, he\ngave no sign of them; from beginning to end, even to me he was the same\nas he is every evening, and he supped with this Jean Valjean with the\nsame air and in the same manner in which he would have supped with M.\nGedeon le Provost, or with the curate of the parish.\n\n\"Towards the end, when he had reached the figs, there came a knock at\nthe door. It was Mother Gerbaud, with her little one in her arms. My\nbrother kissed the child on the brow, and borrowed fifteen sous which I\nhad about me to give to Mother Gerbaud. The man was not paying much\nheed to anything then. He was no longer talking, and he seemed very much\nfatigued. After poor old Gerbaud had taken her departure, my brother\nsaid grace; then he turned to the man and said to him, 'You must be\nin great need of your bed.' Madame Magloire cleared the table very\npromptly. I understood that we must retire, in order to allow this\ntraveller to go to sleep, and we both went up stairs. Nevertheless, I\nsent Madame Magloire down a moment later, to carry to the man's bed a\ngoat skin from the Black Forest, which was in my room. The nights are\nfrigid, and that keeps one warm. It is a pity that this skin is old; all\nthe hair is falling out. My brother bought it while he was in Germany,\nat Tottlingen, near the sources of the Danube, as well as the little\nivory-handled knife which I use at table.\n\n\"Madame Magloire returned immediately. We said our prayers in the\ndrawing-room, where we hang up the linen, and then we each retired to\nour own chambers, without saying a word to each other.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V--TRANQUILLITY\n\nAfter bidding his sister good night, Monseigneur Bienvenu took one of\nthe two silver candlesticks from the table, handed the other to his\nguest, and said to him,--\n\n\"Monsieur, I will conduct you to your room.\"\n\nThe man followed him.\n\nAs might have been observed from what has been said above, the house was\nso arranged that in order to pass into the oratory where the alcove was\nsituated, or to get out of it, it was necessary to traverse the Bishop's\nbedroom.\n\nAt the moment when he was crossing this apartment, Madame Magloire was\nputting away the silverware in the cupboard near the head of the bed.\nThis was her last care every evening before she went to bed.\n\nThe Bishop installed his guest in the alcove. A fresh white bed had been\nprepared there. The man set the candle down on a small table.\n\n\"Well,\" said the Bishop, \"may you pass a good night. To-morrow morning,\nbefore you set out, you shall drink a cup of warm milk from our cows.\"\n\n\"Thanks, Monsieur l'Abbe,\" said the man.\n\nHardly had he pronounced these words full of peace, when all of a\nsudden, and without transition, he made a strange movement, which would\nhave frozen the two sainted women with horror, had they witnessed it.\nEven at this day it is difficult for us to explain what inspired him at\nthat moment. Did he intend to convey a warning or to throw out a menace?\nWas he simply obeying a sort of instinctive impulse which was obscure\neven to himself? He turned abruptly to the old man, folded his arms, and\nbending upon his host a savage gaze, he exclaimed in a hoarse voice:--\n\n\"Ah! really! You lodge me in your house, close to yourself like this?\"\n\nHe broke off, and added with a laugh in which there lurked something\nmonstrous:--\n\n\"Have you really reflected well? How do you know that I have not been an\nassassin?\"\n\nThe Bishop replied:--\n\n\"That is the concern of the good God.\"\n\nThen gravely, and moving his lips like one who is praying or talking\nto himself, he raised two fingers of his right hand and bestowed his\nbenediction on the man, who did not bow, and without turning his head or\nlooking behind him, he returned to his bedroom.\n\nWhen the alcove was in use, a large serge curtain drawn from wall to\nwall concealed the altar. The Bishop knelt before this curtain as he\npassed and said a brief prayer. A moment later he was in his garden,\nwalking, meditating, contemplating, his heart and soul wholly absorbed\nin those grand and mysterious things which God shows at night to the\neyes which remain open.\n\nAs for the man, he was actually so fatigued that he did not even profit\nby the nice white sheets. Snuffing out his candle with his nostrils\nafter the manner of convicts, he dropped, all dressed as he was, upon\nthe bed, where he immediately fell into a profound sleep.\n\nMidnight struck as the Bishop returned from his garden to his apartment.\n\nA few minutes later all were asleep in the little house.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI--JEAN VALJEAN\n\nTowards the middle of the night Jean Valjean woke.\n\nJean Valjean came from a poor peasant family of Brie. He had not learned\nto read in his childhood. When he reached man's estate, he became a\ntree-pruner at Faverolles. His mother was named Jeanne Mathieu; his\nfather was called Jean Valjean or Vlajean, probably a sobriquet, and a\ncontraction of viola Jean, \"here's Jean.\"\n\nJean Valjean was of that thoughtful but not gloomy disposition which\nconstitutes the peculiarity of affectionate natures. On the whole,\nhowever, there was something decidedly sluggish and insignificant about\nJean Valjean in appearance, at least. He had lost his father and mother\nat a very early age. His mother had died of a milk fever, which had not\nbeen properly attended to. His father, a tree-pruner, like himself, had\nbeen killed by a fall from a tree. All that remained to Jean Valjean\nwas a sister older than himself,--a widow with seven children, boys and\ngirls. This sister had brought up Jean Valjean, and so long as she had a\nhusband she lodged and fed her young brother.\n\nThe husband died. The eldest of the seven children was eight years old.\nThe youngest, one.\n\nJean Valjean had just attained his twenty-fifth year. He took the\nfather's place, and, in his turn, supported the sister who had brought\nhim up. This was done simply as a duty and even a little churlishly\non the part of Jean Valjean. Thus his youth had been spent in rude and\nill-paid toil. He had never known a \"kind woman friend\" in his native\nparts. He had not had the time to fall in love.\n\nHe returned at night weary, and ate his broth without uttering a word.\nHis sister, mother Jeanne, often took the best part of his repast from\nhis bowl while he was eating,--a bit of meat, a slice of bacon, the\nheart of the cabbage,--to give to one of her children. As he went on\neating, with his head bent over the table and almost into his soup, his\nlong hair falling about his bowl and concealing his eyes, he had the air\nof perceiving nothing and allowing it. There was at Faverolles, not\nfar from the Valjean thatched cottage, on the other side of the lane,\na farmer's wife named Marie-Claude; the Valjean children, habitually\nfamished, sometimes went to borrow from Marie-Claude a pint of milk, in\ntheir mother's name, which they drank behind a hedge or in some alley\ncorner, snatching the jug from each other so hastily that the little\ngirls spilled it on their aprons and down their necks. If their mother\nhad known of this marauding, she would have punished the delinquents\nseverely. Jean Valjean gruffly and grumblingly paid Marie-Claude for\nthe pint of milk behind their mother's back, and the children were not\npunished.\n\nIn pruning season he earned eighteen sous a day; then he hired out as\na hay-maker, as laborer, as neat-herd on a farm, as a drudge. He did\nwhatever he could. His sister worked also but what could she do with\nseven little children? It was a sad group enveloped in misery, which was\nbeing gradually annihilated. A very hard winter came. Jean had no work.\nThe family had no bread. No bread literally. Seven children!\n\nOne Sunday evening, Maubert Isabeau, the baker on the Church Square at\nFaverolles, was preparing to go to bed, when he heard a violent blow on\nthe grated front of his shop. He arrived in time to see an arm passed\nthrough a hole made by a blow from a fist, through the grating and the\nglass. The arm seized a loaf of bread and carried it off. Isabeau ran\nout in haste; the robber fled at the full speed of his legs. Isabeau ran\nafter him and stopped him. The thief had flung away the loaf, but his\narm was still bleeding. It was Jean Valjean.\n\nThis took place in 1795. Jean Valjean was taken before the tribunals\nof the time for theft and breaking and entering an inhabited house at\nnight. He had a gun which he used better than any one else in the world,\nhe was a bit of a poacher, and this injured his case. There exists a\nlegitimate prejudice against poachers. The poacher, like the smuggler,\nsmacks too strongly of the brigand. Nevertheless, we will remark\ncursorily, there is still an abyss between these races of men and the\nhideous assassin of the towns. The poacher lives in the forest, the\nsmuggler lives in the mountains or on the sea. The cities make ferocious\nmen because they make corrupt men. The mountain, the sea, the forest,\nmake savage men; they develop the fierce side, but often without\ndestroying the humane side.\n\nJean Valjean was pronounced guilty. The terms of the Code were explicit.\nThere occur formidable hours in our civilization; there are moments when\nthe penal laws decree a shipwreck. What an ominous minute is that in\nwhich society draws back and consummates the irreparable abandonment\nof a sentient being! Jean Valjean was condemned to five years in the\ngalleys.\n\nOn the 22d of April, 1796, the victory of Montenotte, won by the\ngeneral-in-chief of the army of Italy, whom the message of the Directory\nto the Five Hundred, of the 2d of Floreal, year IV., calls Buona-Parte,\nwas announced in Paris; on that same day a great gang of galley-slaves\nwas put in chains at Bicetre. Jean Valjean formed a part of that gang.\nAn old turnkey of the prison, who is now nearly eighty years old, still\nrecalls perfectly that unfortunate wretch who was chained to the end of\nthe fourth line, in the north angle of the courtyard. He was seated on\nthe ground like the others. He did not seem to comprehend his position,\nexcept that it was horrible. It is probable that he, also, was\ndisentangling from amid the vague ideas of a poor man, ignorant of\neverything, something excessive. While the bolt of his iron collar was\nbeing riveted behind his head with heavy blows from the hammer, he wept,\nhis tears stifled him, they impeded his speech; he only managed to\nsay from time to time, \"I was a tree-pruner at Faverolles.\" Then still\nsobbing, he raised his right hand and lowered it gradually seven times,\nas though he were touching in succession seven heads of unequal heights,\nand from this gesture it was divined that the thing which he had done,\nwhatever it was, he had done for the sake of clothing and nourishing\nseven little children.\n\nHe set out for Toulon. He arrived there, after a journey of twenty-seven\ndays, on a cart, with a chain on his neck. At Toulon he was clothed in\nthe red cassock. All that had constituted his life, even to his name,\nwas effaced; he was no longer even Jean Valjean; he was number 24,601.\nWhat became of his sister? What became of the seven children? Who\ntroubled himself about that? What becomes of the handful of leaves from\nthe young tree which is sawed off at the root?\n\nIt is always the same story. These poor living beings, these creatures\nof God, henceforth without support, without guide, without refuge,\nwandered away at random,--who even knows?--each in his own direction\nperhaps, and little by little buried themselves in that cold mist which\nengulfs solitary destinies; gloomy shades, into which disappear in\nsuccession so many unlucky heads, in the sombre march of the human race.\nThey quitted the country. The clock-tower of what had been their village\nforgot them; the boundary line of what had been their field forgot them;\nafter a few years' residence in the galleys, Jean Valjean himself forgot\nthem. In that heart, where there had been a wound, there was a scar.\nThat is all. Only once, during all the time which he spent at Toulon,\ndid he hear his sister mentioned. This happened, I think, towards\nthe end of the fourth year of his captivity. I know not through what\nchannels the news reached him. Some one who had known them in their\nown country had seen his sister. She was in Paris. She lived in a poor\nstreet Rear Saint-Sulpice, in the Rue du Gindre. She had with her only\none child, a little boy, the youngest. Where were the other six? Perhaps\nshe did not know herself. Every morning she went to a printing office,\nNo. 3 Rue du Sabot, where she was a folder and stitcher. She was obliged\nto be there at six o'clock in the morning--long before daylight in\nwinter. In the same building with the printing office there was a\nschool, and to this school she took her little boy, who was seven years\nold. But as she entered the printing office at six, and the school only\nopened at seven, the child had to wait in the courtyard, for the school\nto open, for an hour--one hour of a winter night in the open air! They\nwould not allow the child to come into the printing office, because he\nwas in the way, they said. When the workmen passed in the morning, they\nbeheld this poor little being seated on the pavement, overcome with\ndrowsiness, and often fast asleep in the shadow, crouched down and\ndoubled up over his basket. When it rained, an old woman, the portress,\ntook pity on him; she took him into her den, where there was a pallet, a\nspinning-wheel, and two wooden chairs, and the little one slumbered in a\ncorner, pressing himself close to the cat that he might suffer less from\ncold. At seven o'clock the school opened, and he entered. That is what\nwas told to Jean Valjean.\n\nThey talked to him about it for one day; it was a moment, a flash,\nas though a window had suddenly been opened upon the destiny of those\nthings whom he had loved; then all closed again. He heard nothing more\nforever. Nothing from them ever reached him again; he never beheld\nthem; he never met them again; and in the continuation of this mournful\nhistory they will not be met with any more.\n\nTowards the end of this fourth year Jean Valjean's turn to escape\narrived. His comrades assisted him, as is the custom in that sad place.\nHe escaped. He wandered for two days in the fields at liberty, if being\nat liberty is to be hunted, to turn the head every instant, to quake at\nthe slightest noise, to be afraid of everything,--of a smoking roof,\nof a passing man, of a barking dog, of a galloping horse, of a striking\nclock, of the day because one can see, of the night because one cannot\nsee, of the highway, of the path, of a bush, of sleep. On the evening\nof the second day he was captured. He had neither eaten nor slept for\nthirty-six hours. The maritime tribunal condemned him, for this crime,\nto a prolongation of his term for three years, which made eight years.\nIn the sixth year his turn to escape occurred again; he availed himself\nof it, but could not accomplish his flight fully. He was missing at\nroll-call. The cannon were fired, and at night the patrol found him\nhidden under the keel of a vessel in process of construction; he\nresisted the galley guards who seized him. Escape and rebellion. This\ncase, provided for by a special code, was punished by an addition of\nfive years, two of them in the double chain. Thirteen years. In the\ntenth year his turn came round again; he again profited by it; he\nsucceeded no better. Three years for this fresh attempt. Sixteen years.\nFinally, I think it was during his thirteenth year, he made a last\nattempt, and only succeeded in getting retaken at the end of four\nhours of absence. Three years for those four hours. Nineteen years. In\nOctober, 1815, he was released; he had entered there in 1796, for having\nbroken a pane of glass and taken a loaf of bread.\n\nRoom for a brief parenthesis. This is the second time, during his\nstudies on the penal question and damnation by law, that the author of\nthis book has come across the theft of a loaf of bread as the point of\ndeparture for the disaster of a destiny. Claude Gueux had stolen a loaf;\nJean Valjean had stolen a loaf. English statistics prove the fact that\nfour thefts out of five in London have hunger for their immediate cause.\n\nJean Valjean had entered the galleys sobbing and shuddering; he emerged\nimpassive. He had entered in despair; he emerged gloomy.\n\nWhat had taken place in that soul?\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII--THE INTERIOR OF DESPAIR\n\n\nLet us try to say it.\n\nIt is necessary that society should look at these things, because it is\nitself which creates them.\n\nHe was, as we have said, an ignorant man, but he was not a fool. The\nlight of nature was ignited in him. Unhappiness, which also possesses a\nclearness of vision of its own, augmented the small amount of daylight\nwhich existed in this mind. Beneath the cudgel, beneath the chain, in\nthe cell, in hardship, beneath the burning sun of the galleys, upon the\nplank bed of the convict, he withdrew into his own consciousness and\nmeditated.\n\nHe constituted himself the tribunal.\n\nHe began by putting himself on trial.\n\nHe recognized the fact that he was not an innocent man unjustly\npunished. He admitted that he had committed an extreme and blameworthy\nact; that that loaf of bread would probably not have been refused to\nhim had he asked for it; that, in any case, it would have been better to\nwait until he could get it through compassion or through work; that\nit is not an unanswerable argument to say, \"Can one wait when one is\nhungry?\" That, in the first place, it is very rare for any one to die of\nhunger, literally; and next, that, fortunately or unfortunately, man\nis so constituted that he can suffer long and much, both morally and\nphysically, without dying; that it is therefore necessary to have\npatience; that that would even have been better for those poor little\nchildren; that it had been an act of madness for him, a miserable,\nunfortunate wretch, to take society at large violently by the collar,\nand to imagine that one can escape from misery through theft; that that\nis in any case a poor door through which to escape from misery through\nwhich infamy enters; in short, that he was in the wrong.\n\nThen he asked himself--\n\nWhether he had been the only one in fault in his fatal history. Whether\nit was not a serious thing, that he, a laborer, out of work, that he, an\nindustrious man, should have lacked bread. And whether, the fault once\ncommitted and confessed, the chastisement had not been ferocious and\ndisproportioned. Whether there had not been more abuse on the part of\nthe law, in respect to the penalty, than there had been on the part\nof the culprit in respect to his fault. Whether there had not been an\nexcess of weights in one balance of the scale, in the one which contains\nexpiation. Whether the over-weight of the penalty was not equivalent\nto the annihilation of the crime, and did not result in reversing the\nsituation, of replacing the fault of the delinquent by the fault of the\nrepression, of converting the guilty man into the victim, and the debtor\ninto the creditor, and of ranging the law definitely on the side of the\nman who had violated it.\n\nWhether this penalty, complicated by successive aggravations for\nattempts at escape, had not ended in becoming a sort of outrage\nperpetrated by the stronger upon the feebler, a crime of society against\nthe individual, a crime which was being committed afresh every day, a\ncrime which had lasted nineteen years.\n\nHe asked himself whether human society could have the right to force its\nmembers to suffer equally in one case for its own unreasonable lack\nof foresight, and in the other case for its pitiless foresight; and to\nseize a poor man forever between a defect and an excess, a default of\nwork and an excess of punishment.\n\nWhether it was not outrageous for society to treat thus precisely those\nof its members who were the least well endowed in the division of goods\nmade by chance, and consequently the most deserving of consideration.\n\nThese questions put and answered, he judged society and condemned it.\n\nHe condemned it to his hatred.\n\nHe made it responsible for the fate which he was suffering, and he said\nto himself that it might be that one day he should not hesitate to call\nit to account. He declared to himself that there was no equilibrium\nbetween the harm which he had caused and the harm which was being done\nto him; he finally arrived at the conclusion that his punishment was\nnot, in truth, unjust, but that it most assuredly was iniquitous.\n\nAnger may be both foolish and absurd; one can be irritated wrongfully;\none is exasperated only when there is some show of right on one's side\nat bottom. Jean Valjean felt himself exasperated.\n\nAnd besides, human society had done him nothing but harm; he had never\nseen anything of it save that angry face which it calls Justice, and\nwhich it shows to those whom it strikes. Men had only touched him to\nbruise him. Every contact with them had been a blow. Never, since\nhis infancy, since the days of his mother, of his sister, had he ever\nencountered a friendly word and a kindly glance. From suffering to\nsuffering, he had gradually arrived at the conviction that life is a\nwar; and that in this war he was the conquered. He had no other weapon\nthan his hate. He resolved to whet it in the galleys and to bear it away\nwith him when he departed.\n\nThere was at Toulon a school for the convicts, kept by the Ignorantin\nfriars, where the most necessary branches were taught to those of the\nunfortunate men who had a mind for them. He was of the number who had\na mind. He went to school at the age of forty, and learned to read,\nto write, to cipher. He felt that to fortify his intelligence was to\nfortify his hate. In certain cases, education and enlightenment can\nserve to eke out evil.\n\nThis is a sad thing to say; after having judged society, which had\ncaused his unhappiness, he judged Providence, which had made society,\nand he condemned it also.\n\nThus during nineteen years of torture and slavery, this soul mounted and\nat the same time fell. Light entered it on one side, and darkness on the\nother.\n\nJean Valjean had not, as we have seen, an evil nature. He was still good\nwhen he arrived at the galleys. He there condemned society, and felt\nthat he was becoming wicked; he there condemned Providence, and was\nconscious that he was becoming impious.\n\nIt is difficult not to indulge in meditation at this point.\n\nDoes human nature thus change utterly and from top to bottom? Can the\nman created good by God be rendered wicked by man? Can the soul be\ncompletely made over by fate, and become evil, fate being evil? Can\nthe heart become misshapen and contract incurable deformities and\ninfirmities under the oppression of a disproportionate unhappiness,\nas the vertebral column beneath too low a vault? Is there not in every\nhuman soul, was there not in the soul of Jean Valjean in particular, a\nfirst spark, a divine element, incorruptible in this world, immortal in\nthe other, which good can develop, fan, ignite, and make to glow with\nsplendor, and which evil can never wholly extinguish?\n\nGrave and obscure questions, to the last of which every physiologist\nwould probably have responded no, and that without hesitation, had\nhe beheld at Toulon, during the hours of repose, which were for Jean\nValjean hours of revery, this gloomy galley-slave, seated with folded\narms upon the bar of some capstan, with the end of his chain thrust into\nhis pocket to prevent its dragging, serious, silent, and thoughtful,\na pariah of the laws which regarded the man with wrath, condemned by\ncivilization, and regarding heaven with severity.\n\nCertainly,--and we make no attempt to dissimulate the fact,--the\nobserving physiologist would have beheld an irremediable misery; he\nwould, perchance, have pitied this sick man, of the law's making; but\nhe would not have even essayed any treatment; he would have turned aside\nhis gaze from the caverns of which he would have caught a glimpse within\nthis soul, and, like Dante at the portals of hell, he would have effaced\nfrom this existence the word which the finger of God has, nevertheless,\ninscribed upon the brow of every man,--hope.\n\nWas this state of his soul, which we have attempted to analyze, as\nperfectly clear to Jean Valjean as we have tried to render it for\nthose who read us? Did Jean Valjean distinctly perceive, after their\nformation, and had he seen distinctly during the process of their\nformation, all the elements of which his moral misery was composed? Had\nthis rough and unlettered man gathered a perfectly clear perception of\nthe succession of ideas through which he had, by degrees, mounted and\ndescended to the lugubrious aspects which had, for so many years, formed\nthe inner horizon of his spirit? Was he conscious of all that passed\nwithin him, and of all that was working there? That is something\nwhich we do not presume to state; it is something which we do not even\nbelieve. There was too much ignorance in Jean Valjean, even after his\nmisfortune, to prevent much vagueness from still lingering there. At\ntimes he did not rightly know himself what he felt. Jean Valjean was in\nthe shadows; he suffered in the shadows; he hated in the shadows; one\nmight have said that he hated in advance of himself. He dwelt habitually\nin this shadow, feeling his way like a blind man and a dreamer. Only, at\nintervals, there suddenly came to him, from without and from within, an\naccess of wrath, a surcharge of suffering, a livid and rapid flash which\nilluminated his whole soul, and caused to appear abruptly all around\nhim, in front, behind, amid the gleams of a frightful light, the hideous\nprecipices and the sombre perspective of his destiny.\n\nThe flash passed, the night closed in again; and where was he? He no\nlonger knew. The peculiarity of pains of this nature, in which\nthat which is pitiless--that is to say, that which is\nbrutalizing--predominates, is to transform a man, little by little, by\na sort of stupid transfiguration, into a wild beast; sometimes into a\nferocious beast.\n\nJean Valjean's successive and obstinate attempts at escape would alone\nsuffice to prove this strange working of the law upon the human soul.\nJean Valjean would have renewed these attempts, utterly useless and\nfoolish as they were, as often as the opportunity had presented itself,\nwithout reflecting for an instant on the result, nor on the experiences\nwhich he had already gone through. He escaped impetuously, like the wolf\nwho finds his cage open. Instinct said to him, \"Flee!\" Reason would have\nsaid, \"Remain!\" But in the presence of so violent a temptation, reason\nvanished; nothing remained but instinct. The beast alone acted. When\nhe was recaptured, the fresh severities inflicted on him only served to\nrender him still more wild.\n\nOne detail, which we must not omit, is that he possessed a physical\nstrength which was not approached by a single one of the denizens of the\ngalleys. At work, at paying out a cable or winding up a capstan, Jean\nValjean was worth four men. He sometimes lifted and sustained enormous\nweights on his back; and when the occasion demanded it, he replaced that\nimplement which is called a jack-screw, and was formerly called orgueil\n[pride], whence, we may remark in passing, is derived the name of the\nRue Montorgueil, near the Halles [Fishmarket] in Paris. His comrades had\nnicknamed him Jean the Jack-screw. Once, when they were repairing the\nbalcony of the town-hall at Toulon, one of those admirable caryatids of\nPuget, which support the balcony, became loosened, and was on the point\nof falling. Jean Valjean, who was present, supported the caryatid with\nhis shoulder, and gave the workmen time to arrive.\n\nHis suppleness even exceeded his strength. Certain convicts who were\nforever dreaming of escape, ended by making a veritable science of force\nand skill combined. It is the science of muscles. An entire system of\nmysterious statics is daily practised by prisoners, men who are forever\nenvious of the flies and birds. To climb a vertical surface, and to find\npoints of support where hardly a projection was visible, was play to\nJean Valjean. An angle of the wall being given, with the tension of his\nback and legs, with his elbows and his heels fitted into the unevenness\nof the stone, he raised himself as if by magic to the third story. He\nsometimes mounted thus even to the roof of the galley prison.\n\nHe spoke but little. He laughed not at all. An excessive emotion was\nrequired to wring from him, once or twice a year, that lugubrious laugh\nof the convict, which is like the echo of the laugh of a demon. To all\nappearance, he seemed to be occupied in the constant contemplation of\nsomething terrible.\n\nHe was absorbed, in fact.\n\nAthwart the unhealthy perceptions of an incomplete nature and a crushed\nintelligence, he was confusedly conscious that some monstrous thing was\nresting on him. In that obscure and wan shadow within which he crawled,\neach time that he turned his neck and essayed to raise his glance,\nhe perceived with terror, mingled with rage, a sort of frightful\naccumulation of things, collecting and mounting above him, beyond the\nrange of his vision,--laws, prejudices, men, and deeds,--whose outlines\nescaped him, whose mass terrified him, and which was nothing else than\nthat prodigious pyramid which we call civilization. He distinguished,\nhere and there in that swarming and formless mass, now near him, now\nafar off and on inaccessible table-lands, some group, some detail,\nvividly illuminated; here the galley-sergeant and his cudgel; there the\ngendarme and his sword; yonder the mitred archbishop; away at the top,\nlike a sort of sun, the Emperor, crowned and dazzling. It seemed to him\nthat these distant splendors, far from dissipating his night, rendered\nit more funereal and more black. All this--laws, prejudices, deeds, men,\nthings--went and came above him, over his head, in accordance with the\ncomplicated and mysterious movement which God imparts to civilization,\nwalking over him and crushing him with I know not what peacefulness\nin its cruelty and inexorability in its indifference. Souls which have\nfallen to the bottom of all possible misfortune, unhappy men lost in the\nlowest of those limbos at which no one any longer looks, the reproved of\nthe law, feel the whole weight of this human society, so formidable for\nhim who is without, so frightful for him who is beneath, resting upon\ntheir heads.\n\nIn this situation Jean Valjean meditated; and what could be the nature\nof his meditation?\n\nIf the grain of millet beneath the millstone had thoughts, it would,\ndoubtless, think that same thing which Jean Valjean thought.\n\nAll these things, realities full of spectres, phantasmagories full of\nrealities, had eventually created for him a sort of interior state which\nis almost indescribable.\n\nAt times, amid his convict toil, he paused. He fell to thinking. His\nreason, at one and the same time riper and more troubled than of yore,\nrose in revolt. Everything which had happened to him seemed to him\nabsurd; everything that surrounded him seemed to him impossible. He said\nto himself, \"It is a dream.\" He gazed at the galley-sergeant standing a\nfew paces from him; the galley-sergeant seemed a phantom to him. All of\na sudden the phantom dealt him a blow with his cudgel.\n\nVisible nature hardly existed for him. It would almost be true to say\nthat there existed for Jean Valjean neither sun, nor fine summer days,\nnor radiant sky, nor fresh April dawns. I know not what vent-hole\ndaylight habitually illumined his soul.\n\nTo sum up, in conclusion, that which can be summed up and translated\ninto positive results in all that we have just pointed out, we will\nconfine ourselves to the statement that, in the course of nineteen\nyears, Jean Valjean, the inoffensive tree-pruner of Faverolles, the\nformidable convict of Toulon, had become capable, thanks to the manner\nin which the galleys had moulded him, of two sorts of evil action:\nfirstly, of evil action which was rapid, unpremeditated, dashing,\nentirely instinctive, in the nature of reprisals for the evil which\nhe had undergone; secondly, of evil action which was serious, grave,\nconsciously argued out and premeditated, with the false ideas which\nsuch a misfortune can furnish. His deliberate deeds passed through\nthree successive phases, which natures of a certain stamp can alone\ntraverse,--reasoning, will, perseverance. He had for moving causes his\nhabitual wrath, bitterness of soul, a profound sense of indignities\nsuffered, the reaction even against the good, the innocent, and the\njust, if there are any such. The point of departure, like the point\nof arrival, for all his thoughts, was hatred of human law; that hatred\nwhich, if it be not arrested in its development by some providential\nincident, becomes, within a given time, the hatred of society, then\nthe hatred of the human race, then the hatred of creation, and which\nmanifests itself by a vague, incessant, and brutal desire to do harm to\nsome living being, no matter whom. It will be perceived that it was\nnot without reason that Jean Valjean's passport described him as a very\ndangerous man.\n\nFrom year to year this soul had dried away slowly, but with fatal\nsureness. When the heart is dry, the eye is dry. On his departure from\nthe galleys it had been nineteen years since he had shed a tear.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII--BILLOWS AND SHADOWS\n\n\nA man overboard!\n\nWhat matters it? The vessel does not halt. The wind blows. That sombre\nship has a path which it is forced to pursue. It passes on.\n\nThe man disappears, then reappears; he plunges, he rises again to the\nsurface; he calls, he stretches out his arms; he is not heard. The\nvessel, trembling under the hurricane, is wholly absorbed in its own\nworkings; the passengers and sailors do not even see the drowning man;\nhis miserable head is but a speck amid the immensity of the waves. He\ngives vent to desperate cries from out of the depths. What a spectre is\nthat retreating sail! He gazes and gazes at it frantically. It retreats,\nit grows dim, it diminishes in size. He was there but just now, he was\none of the crew, he went and came along the deck with the rest, he had\nhis part of breath and of sunlight, he was a living man. Now, what has\ntaken place? He has slipped, he has fallen; all is at an end.\n\nHe is in the tremendous sea. Under foot he has nothing but what flees\nand crumbles. The billows, torn and lashed by the wind, encompass him\nhideously; the tossings of the abyss bear him away; all the tongues of\nwater dash over his head; a populace of waves spits upon him; confused\nopenings half devour him; every time that he sinks, he catches glimpses\nof precipices filled with night; frightful and unknown vegetations seize\nhim, knot about his feet, draw him to them; he is conscious that he is\nbecoming an abyss, that he forms part of the foam; the waves toss him\nfrom one to another; he drinks in the bitterness; the cowardly ocean\nattacks him furiously, to drown him; the enormity plays with his agony.\nIt seems as though all that water were hate.\n\nNevertheless, he struggles.\n\nHe tries to defend himself; he tries to sustain himself; he makes\nan effort; he swims. He, his petty strength all exhausted instantly,\ncombats the inexhaustible.\n\nWhere, then, is the ship? Yonder. Barely visible in the pale shadows of\nthe horizon.\n\nThe wind blows in gusts; all the foam overwhelms him. He raises his eyes\nand beholds only the lividness of the clouds. He witnesses, amid his\ndeath-pangs, the immense madness of the sea. He is tortured by this\nmadness; he hears noises strange to man, which seem to come from beyond\nthe limits of the earth, and from one knows not what frightful region\nbeyond.\n\nThere are birds in the clouds, just as there are angels above human\ndistresses; but what can they do for him? They sing and fly and float,\nand he, he rattles in the death agony.\n\nHe feels himself buried in those two infinities, the ocean and the sky,\nat one and the same time: the one is a tomb; the other is a shroud.\n\nNight descends; he has been swimming for hours; his strength is\nexhausted; that ship, that distant thing in which there were men, has\nvanished; he is alone in the formidable twilight gulf; he sinks, he\nstiffens himself, he twists himself; he feels under him the monstrous\nbillows of the invisible; he shouts.\n\nThere are no more men. Where is God?\n\nHe shouts. Help! Help! He still shouts on.\n\nNothing on the horizon; nothing in heaven.\n\nHe implores the expanse, the waves, the seaweed, the reef; they are\ndeaf. He beseeches the tempest; the imperturbable tempest obeys only the\ninfinite.\n\nAround him darkness, fog, solitude, the stormy and nonsentient tumult,\nthe undefined curling of those wild waters. In him horror and fatigue.\nBeneath him the depths. Not a point of support. He thinks of the gloomy\nadventures of the corpse in the limitless shadow. The bottomless cold\nparalyzes him. His hands contract convulsively; they close, and grasp\nnothingness. Winds, clouds, whirlwinds, gusts, useless stars! What is\nto be done? The desperate man gives up; he is weary, he chooses the\nalternative of death; he resists not; he lets himself go; he abandons\nhis grip; and then he tosses forevermore in the lugubrious dreary depths\nof engulfment.\n\nOh, implacable march of human societies! Oh, losses of men and of\nsouls on the way! Ocean into which falls all that the law lets slip!\nDisastrous absence of help! Oh, moral death!\n\nThe sea is the inexorable social night into which the penal laws fling\ntheir condemned. The sea is the immensity of wretchedness.\n\nThe soul, going down stream in this gulf, may become a corpse. Who shall\nresuscitate it?\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX--NEW TROUBLES\n\nWhen the hour came for him to take his departure from the galleys, when\nJean Valjean heard in his ear the strange words, Thou art free! the\nmoment seemed improbable and unprecedented; a ray of vivid light, a ray\nof the true light of the living, suddenly penetrated within him. But it\nwas not long before this ray paled. Jean Valjean had been dazzled by\nthe idea of liberty. He had believed in a new life. He very speedily\nperceived what sort of liberty it is to which a yellow passport is\nprovided.\n\nAnd this was encompassed with much bitterness. He had calculated that\nhis earnings, during his sojourn in the galleys, ought to amount to\na hundred and seventy-one francs. It is but just to add that he had\nforgotten to include in his calculations the forced repose of Sundays\nand festival days during nineteen years, which entailed a diminution\nof about eighty francs. At all events, his hoard had been reduced by\nvarious local levies to the sum of one hundred and nine francs fifteen\nsous, which had been counted out to him on his departure. He had\nunderstood nothing of this, and had thought himself wronged. Let us say\nthe word--robbed.\n\nOn the day following his liberation, he saw, at Grasse, in front of\nan orange-flower distillery, some men engaged in unloading bales. He\noffered his services. Business was pressing; they were accepted. He set\nto work. He was intelligent, robust, adroit; he did his best; the master\nseemed pleased. While he was at work, a gendarme passed, observed\nhim, and demanded his papers. It was necessary to show him the yellow\npassport. That done, Jean Valjean resumed his labor. A little while\nbefore he had questioned one of the workmen as to the amount which they\nearned each day at this occupation; he had been told thirty sous. When\nevening arrived, as he was forced to set out again on the following day,\nhe presented himself to the owner of the distillery and requested to be\npaid. The owner did not utter a word, but handed him twenty-five sous. He\nobjected. He was told, \"That is enough for thee.\" He persisted. The\nmaster looked him straight between the eyes, and said to him \"Beware of\nthe prison.\"\n\nThere, again, he considered that he had been robbed.\n\nSociety, the State, by diminishing his hoard, had robbed him wholesale.\nNow it was the individual who was robbing him at retail.\n\nLiberation is not deliverance. One gets free from the galleys, but not\nfrom the sentence.\n\nThat is what happened to him at Grasse. We have seen in what manner he\nwas received at D----\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X--THE MAN AROUSED\n\nAs the Cathedral clock struck two in the morning, Jean Valjean awoke.\n\nWhat woke him was that his bed was too good. It was nearly twenty years\nsince he had slept in a bed, and, although he had not undressed, the\nsensation was too novel not to disturb his slumbers.\n\nHe had slept more than four hours. His fatigue had passed away. He was\naccustomed not to devote many hours to repose.\n\nHe opened his eyes and stared into the gloom which surrounded him; then\nhe closed them again, with the intention of going to sleep once more.\n\nWhen many varied sensations have agitated the day, when various matters\npreoccupy the mind, one falls asleep once, but not a second time.\nSleep comes more easily than it returns. This is what happened to Jean\nValjean. He could not get to sleep again, and he fell to thinking.\n\nHe was at one of those moments when the thoughts which one has in one's\nmind are troubled. There was a sort of dark confusion in his brain. His\nmemories of the olden time and of the immediate present floated there\npell-mell and mingled confusedly, losing their proper forms, becoming\ndisproportionately large, then suddenly disappearing, as in a muddy and\nperturbed pool. Many thoughts occurred to him; but there was one which\nkept constantly presenting itself afresh, and which drove away all\nothers. We will mention this thought at once: he had observed the six\nsets of silver forks and spoons and the ladle which Madame Magloire had\nplaced on the table.\n\nThose six sets of silver haunted him.--They were there.--A few paces\ndistant.--Just as he was traversing the adjoining room to reach the\none in which he then was, the old servant-woman had been in the act\nof placing them in a little cupboard near the head of the bed.--He had\ntaken careful note of this cupboard.--On the right, as you entered from\nthe dining-room.--They were solid.--And old silver.--From the ladle one\ncould get at least two hundred francs.--Double what he had earned in\nnineteen years.--It is true that he would have earned more if \"the\nadministration had not robbed him.\"\n\nHis mind wavered for a whole hour in fluctuations with which there was\ncertainly mingled some struggle. Three o'clock struck. He opened his\neyes again, drew himself up abruptly into a sitting posture, stretched\nout his arm and felt of his knapsack, which he had thrown down on a\ncorner of the alcove; then he hung his legs over the edge of the bed,\nand placed his feet on the floor, and thus found himself, almost without\nknowing it, seated on his bed.\n\nHe remained for a time thoughtfully in this attitude, which would have\nbeen suggestive of something sinister for any one who had seen him\nthus in the dark, the only person awake in that house where all were\nsleeping. All of a sudden he stooped down, removed his shoes and placed\nthem softly on the mat beside the bed; then he resumed his thoughtful\nattitude, and became motionless once more.\n\nThroughout this hideous meditation, the thoughts which we have above\nindicated moved incessantly through his brain; entered, withdrew,\nre-entered, and in a manner oppressed him; and then he thought, also,\nwithout knowing why, and with the mechanical persistence of revery, of\na convict named Brevet, whom he had known in the galleys, and whose\ntrousers had been upheld by a single suspender of knitted cotton. The\ncheckered pattern of that suspender recurred incessantly to his mind.\n\nHe remained in this situation, and would have so remained indefinitely,\neven until daybreak, had not the clock struck one--the half or quarter\nhour. It seemed to him that that stroke said to him, \"Come on!\"\n\nHe rose to his feet, hesitated still another moment, and listened; all\nwas quiet in the house; then he walked straight ahead, with short steps,\nto the window, of which he caught a glimpse. The night was not very\ndark; there was a full moon, across which coursed large clouds driven by\nthe wind. This created, outdoors, alternate shadow and gleams of light,\neclipses, then bright openings of the clouds; and indoors a sort of\ntwilight. This twilight, sufficient to enable a person to see his way,\nintermittent on account of the clouds, resembled the sort of livid light\nwhich falls through an air-hole in a cellar, before which the passersby\ncome and go. On arriving at the window, Jean Valjean examined it. It had\nno grating; it opened in the garden and was fastened, according to the\nfashion of the country, only by a small pin. He opened it; but as a\nrush of cold and piercing air penetrated the room abruptly, he closed\nit again immediately. He scrutinized the garden with that attentive gaze\nwhich studies rather than looks. The garden was enclosed by a tolerably\nlow white wall, easy to climb. Far away, at the extremity, he perceived\ntops of trees, spaced at regular intervals, which indicated that the\nwall separated the garden from an avenue or lane planted with trees.\n\nHaving taken this survey, he executed a movement like that of a man who\nhas made up his mind, strode to his alcove, grasped his knapsack, opened\nit, fumbled in it, pulled out of it something which he placed on the\nbed, put his shoes into one of his pockets, shut the whole thing up\nagain, threw the knapsack on his shoulders, put on his cap, drew the\nvisor down over his eyes, felt for his cudgel, went and placed it in the\nangle of the window; then returned to the bed, and resolutely seized the\nobject which he had deposited there. It resembled a short bar of\niron, pointed like a pike at one end. It would have been difficult to\ndistinguish in that darkness for what employment that bit of iron could\nhave been designed. Perhaps it was a lever; possibly it was a club.\n\nIn the daytime it would have been possible to recognize it as nothing\nmore than a miner's candlestick. Convicts were, at that period,\nsometimes employed in quarrying stone from the lofty hills which environ\nToulon, and it was not rare for them to have miners' tools at their\ncommand. These miners' candlesticks are of massive iron, terminated at\nthe lower extremity by a point, by means of which they are stuck into\nthe rock.\n\nHe took the candlestick in his right hand; holding his breath and trying\nto deaden the sound of his tread, he directed his steps to the door of\nthe adjoining room, occupied by the Bishop, as we already know.\n\nOn arriving at this door, he found it ajar. The Bishop had not closed\nit.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI--WHAT HE DOES\n\nJean Valjean listened. Not a sound.\n\nHe gave the door a push.\n\nHe pushed it gently with the tip of his finger, lightly, with the\nfurtive and uneasy gentleness of a cat which is desirous of entering.\n\nThe door yielded to this pressure, and made an imperceptible and silent\nmovement, which enlarged the opening a little.\n\nHe waited a moment; then gave the door a second and a bolder push.\n\nIt continued to yield in silence. The opening was now large enough to\nallow him to pass. But near the door there stood a little table, which\nformed an embarrassing angle with it, and barred the entrance.\n\nJean Valjean recognized the difficulty. It was necessary, at any cost,\nto enlarge the aperture still further.\n\nHe decided on his course of action, and gave the door a third push, more\nenergetic than the two preceding. This time a badly oiled hinge suddenly\nemitted amid the silence a hoarse and prolonged cry.\n\nJean Valjean shuddered. The noise of the hinge rang in his ears with\nsomething of the piercing and formidable sound of the trump of the Day\nof Judgment.\n\nIn the fantastic exaggerations of the first moment he almost imagined\nthat that hinge had just become animated, and had suddenly assumed a\nterrible life, and that it was barking like a dog to arouse every one,\nand warn and to wake those who were asleep. He halted, shuddering,\nbewildered, and fell back from the tips of his toes upon his heels. He\nheard the arteries in his temples beating like two forge hammers, and\nit seemed to him that his breath issued from his breast with the roar\nof the wind issuing from a cavern. It seemed impossible to him that the\nhorrible clamor of that irritated hinge should not have disturbed the\nentire household, like the shock of an earthquake; the door, pushed by\nhim, had taken the alarm, and had shouted; the old man would rise at\nonce; the two old women would shriek out; people would come to their\nassistance; in less than a quarter of an hour the town would be in an\nuproar, and the gendarmerie on hand. For a moment he thought himself\nlost.\n\nHe remained where he was, petrified like the statue of salt, not daring\nto make a movement. Several minutes elapsed. The door had fallen wide\nopen. He ventured to peep into the next room. Nothing had stirred there.\nHe lent an ear. Nothing was moving in the house. The noise made by the\nrusty hinge had not awakened any one.\n\nThis first danger was past; but there still reigned a frightful tumult\nwithin him. Nevertheless, he did not retreat. Even when he had thought\nhimself lost, he had not drawn back. His only thought now was to finish\nas soon as possible. He took a step and entered the room.\n\nThis room was in a state of perfect calm. Here and there vague and\nconfused forms were distinguishable, which in the daylight were papers\nscattered on a table, open folios, volumes piled upon a stool, an\narm-chair heaped with clothing, a prie-Dieu, and which at that hour\nwere only shadowy corners and whitish spots. Jean Valjean advanced with\nprecaution, taking care not to knock against the furniture. He could\nhear, at the extremity of the room, the even and tranquil breathing of\nthe sleeping Bishop.\n\nHe suddenly came to a halt. He was near the bed. He had arrived there\nsooner than he had thought for.\n\nNature sometimes mingles her effects and her spectacles with our actions\nwith sombre and intelligent appropriateness, as though she desired to\nmake us reflect. For the last half-hour a large cloud had covered the\nheavens. At the moment when Jean Valjean paused in front of the bed,\nthis cloud parted, as though on purpose, and a ray of light, traversing\nthe long window, suddenly illuminated the Bishop's pale face. He was\nsleeping peacefully. He lay in his bed almost completely dressed, on\naccount of the cold of the Basses-Alps, in a garment of brown wool,\nwhich covered his arms to the wrists. His head was thrown back on the\npillow, in the careless attitude of repose; his hand, adorned with the\npastoral ring, and whence had fallen so many good deeds and so many\nholy actions, was hanging over the edge of the bed. His whole face\nwas illumined with a vague expression of satisfaction, of hope, and of\nfelicity. It was more than a smile, and almost a radiance. He bore upon\nhis brow the indescribable reflection of a light which was invisible.\nThe soul of the just contemplates in sleep a mysterious heaven.\n\nA reflection of that heaven rested on the Bishop.\n\nIt was, at the same time, a luminous transparency, for that heaven was\nwithin him. That heaven was his conscience.\n\n[Illustration: The Fall  1b2-10-the-fall]\n\nAt the moment when the ray of moonlight superposed itself, so to speak,\nupon that inward radiance, the sleeping Bishop seemed as in a glory. It\nremained, however, gentle and veiled in an ineffable half-light. That\nmoon in the sky, that slumbering nature, that garden without a quiver,\nthat house which was so calm, the hour, the moment, the silence, added\nsome solemn and unspeakable quality to the venerable repose of this man,\nand enveloped in a sort of serene and majestic aureole that white\nhair, those closed eyes, that face in which all was hope and all was\nconfidence, that head of an old man, and that slumber of an infant.\n\nThere was something almost divine in this man, who was thus august,\nwithout being himself aware of it.\n\nJean Valjean was in the shadow, and stood motionless, with his iron\ncandlestick in his hand, frightened by this luminous old man. Never had\nhe beheld anything like this. This confidence terrified him. The\nmoral world has no grander spectacle than this: a troubled and\nuneasy conscience, which has arrived on the brink of an evil action,\ncontemplating the slumber of the just.\n\nThat slumber in that isolation, and with a neighbor like himself, had\nabout it something sublime, of which he was vaguely but imperiously\nconscious.\n\nNo one could have told what was passing within him, not even himself. In\norder to attempt to form an idea of it, it is necessary to think of the\nmost violent of things in the presence of the most gentle. Even on\nhis visage it would have been impossible to distinguish anything with\ncertainty. It was a sort of haggard astonishment. He gazed at it, and\nthat was all. But what was his thought? It would have been impossible to\ndivine it. What was evident was, that he was touched and astounded. But\nwhat was the nature of this emotion?\n\nHis eye never quitted the old man. The only thing which was clearly\nto be inferred from his attitude and his physiognomy was a strange\nindecision. One would have said that he was hesitating between the two\nabysses,--the one in which one loses one's self and that in which one\nsaves one's self. He seemed prepared to crush that skull or to kiss that\nhand.\n\nAt the expiration of a few minutes his left arm rose slowly towards\nhis brow, and he took off his cap; then his arm fell back with the same\ndeliberation, and Jean Valjean fell to meditating once more, his cap in\nhis left hand, his club in his right hand, his hair bristling all over\nhis savage head.\n\nThe Bishop continued to sleep in profound peace beneath that terrifying\ngaze.\n\nThe gleam of the moon rendered confusedly visible the crucifix over the\nchimney-piece, which seemed to be extending its arms to both of them,\nwith a benediction for one and pardon for the other.\n\nSuddenly Jean Valjean replaced his cap on his brow; then stepped rapidly\npast the bed, without glancing at the Bishop, straight to the cupboard,\nwhich he saw near the head; he raised his iron candlestick as though to\nforce the lock; the key was there; he opened it; the first thing which\npresented itself to him was the basket of silverware; he seized it,\ntraversed the chamber with long strides, without taking any precautions\nand without troubling himself about the noise, gained the door,\nre-entered the oratory, opened the window, seized his cudgel, bestrode\nthe window-sill of the ground-floor, put the silver into his knapsack,\nthrew away the basket, crossed the garden, leaped over the wall like a\ntiger, and fled.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII--THE BISHOP WORKS\n\nThe next morning at sunrise Monseigneur Bienvenu was strolling in his\ngarden. Madame Magloire ran up to him in utter consternation.\n\n\"Monseigneur, Monseigneur!\" she exclaimed, \"does your Grace know where\nthe basket of silver is?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" replied the Bishop.\n\n\"Jesus the Lord be blessed!\" she resumed; \"I did not know what had\nbecome of it.\"\n\nThe Bishop had just picked up the basket in a flower-bed. He presented\nit to Madame Magloire.\n\n\"Here it is.\"\n\n\"Well!\" said she. \"Nothing in it! And the silver?\"\n\n\"Ah,\" returned the Bishop, \"so it is the silver which troubles you? I\ndon't know where it is.\"\n\n\"Great, good God! It is stolen! That man who was here last night has\nstolen it.\"\n\nIn a twinkling, with all the vivacity of an alert old woman, Madame\nMagloire had rushed to the oratory, entered the alcove, and returned\nto the Bishop. The Bishop had just bent down, and was sighing as he\nexamined a plant of cochlearia des Guillons, which the basket had broken\nas it fell across the bed. He rose up at Madame Magloire's cry.\n\n\"Monseigneur, the man is gone! The silver has been stolen!\"\n\nAs she uttered this exclamation, her eyes fell upon a corner of the\ngarden, where traces of the wall having been scaled were visible. The\ncoping of the wall had been torn away.\n\n\"Stay! yonder is the way he went. He jumped over into Cochefilet Lane.\nAh, the abomination! He has stolen our silver!\"\n\nThe Bishop remained silent for a moment; then he raised his grave eyes,\nand said gently to Madame Magloire:--\n\n\"And, in the first place, was that silver ours?\"\n\nMadame Magloire was speechless. Another silence ensued; then the Bishop\nwent on:--\n\n\"Madame Magloire, I have for a long time detained that silver\nwrongfully. It belonged to the poor. Who was that man? A poor man,\nevidently.\"\n\n\"Alas! Jesus!\" returned Madame Magloire. \"It is not for my sake, nor for\nMademoiselle's. It makes no difference to us. But it is for the sake of\nMonseigneur. What is Monseigneur to eat with now?\"\n\nThe Bishop gazed at her with an air of amazement.\n\n\"Ah, come! Are there no such things as pewter forks and spoons?\"\n\nMadame Magloire shrugged her shoulders.\n\n\"Pewter has an odor.\"\n\n\"Iron forks and spoons, then.\"\n\nMadame Magloire made an expressive grimace.\n\n\"Iron has a taste.\"\n\n\"Very well,\" said the Bishop; \"wooden ones then.\"\n\nA few moments later he was breakfasting at the very table at which\nJean Valjean had sat on the previous evening. As he ate his breakfast,\nMonseigneur Welcome remarked gayly to his sister, who said nothing, and\nto Madame Magloire, who was grumbling under her breath, that one really\ndoes not need either fork or spoon, even of wood, in order to dip a bit\nof bread in a cup of milk.\n\n\"A pretty idea, truly,\" said Madame Magloire to herself, as she went and\ncame, \"to take in a man like that! and to lodge him close to one's self!\nAnd how fortunate that he did nothing but steal! Ah, mon Dieu! it makes\none shudder to think of it!\"\n\nAs the brother and sister were about to rise from the table, there came\na knock at the door.\n\n\"Come in,\" said the Bishop.\n\nThe door opened. A singular and violent group made its appearance on the\nthreshold. Three men were holding a fourth man by the collar. The three\nmen were gendarmes; the other was Jean Valjean.\n\nA brigadier of gendarmes, who seemed to be in command of the group, was\nstanding near the door. He entered and advanced to the Bishop, making a\nmilitary salute.\n\n\"Monseigneur--\" said he.\n\nAt this word, Jean Valjean, who was dejected and seemed overwhelmed,\nraised his head with an air of stupefaction.\n\n\"Monseigneur!\" he murmured. \"So he is not the cure?\"\n\n\"Silence!\" said the gendarme. \"He is Monseigneur the Bishop.\"\n\nIn the meantime, Monseigneur Bienvenu had advanced as quickly as his\ngreat age permitted.\n\n\"Ah! here you are!\" he exclaimed, looking at Jean Valjean. \"I am glad to\nsee you. Well, but how is this? I gave you the candlesticks too, which\nare of silver like the rest, and for which you can certainly get two\nhundred francs. Why did you not carry them away with your forks and\nspoons?\"\n\nJean Valjean opened his eyes wide, and stared at the venerable Bishop\nwith an expression which no human tongue can render any account of.\n\n\"Monseigneur,\" said the brigadier of gendarmes, \"so what this man said\nis true, then? We came across him. He was walking like a man who is\nrunning away. We stopped him to look into the matter. He had this\nsilver--\"\n\n\"And he told you,\" interposed the Bishop with a smile, \"that it had been\ngiven to him by a kind old fellow of a priest with whom he had passed\nthe night? I see how the matter stands. And you have brought him back\nhere? It is a mistake.\"\n\n\"In that case,\" replied the brigadier, \"we can let him go?\"\n\n\"Certainly,\" replied the Bishop.\n\nThe gendarmes released Jean Valjean, who recoiled.\n\n\"Is it true that I am to be released?\" he said, in an almost\ninarticulate voice, and as though he were talking in his sleep.\n\n\"Yes, thou art released; dost thou not understand?\" said one of the\ngendarmes.\n\n\"My friend,\" resumed the Bishop, \"before you go, here are your\ncandlesticks. Take them.\"\n\nHe stepped to the chimney-piece, took the two silver candlesticks, and\nbrought them to Jean Valjean. The two women looked on without uttering\na word, without a gesture, without a look which could disconcert the\nBishop.\n\nJean Valjean was trembling in every limb. He took the two candlesticks\nmechanically, and with a bewildered air.\n\n\"Now,\" said the Bishop, \"go in peace. By the way, when you return, my\nfriend, it is not necessary to pass through the garden. You can always\nenter and depart through the street door. It is never fastened with\nanything but a latch, either by day or by night.\"\n\nThen, turning to the gendarmes:--\n\n\"You may retire, gentlemen.\"\n\nThe gendarmes retired.\n\nJean Valjean was like a man on the point of fainting.\n\nThe Bishop drew near to him, and said in a low voice:--\n\n\"Do not forget, never forget, that you have promised to use this money\nin becoming an honest man.\"\n\nJean Valjean, who had no recollection of ever having promised anything,\nremained speechless. The Bishop had emphasized the words when he uttered\nthem. He resumed with solemnity:--\n\n\"Jean Valjean, my brother, you no longer belong to evil, but to good. It\nis your soul that I buy from you; I withdraw it from black thoughts and\nthe spirit of perdition, and I give it to God.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII--LITTLE GERVAIS\n\nJean Valjean left the town as though he were fleeing from it. He set out\nat a very hasty pace through the fields, taking whatever roads and paths\npresented themselves to him, without perceiving that he was incessantly\nretracing his steps. He wandered thus the whole morning, without having\neaten anything and without feeling hungry. He was the prey of a throng\nof novel sensations. He was conscious of a sort of rage; he did not\nknow against whom it was directed. He could not have told whether he was\ntouched or humiliated. There came over him at moments a strange emotion\nwhich he resisted and to which he opposed the hardness acquired during\nthe last twenty years of his life. This state of mind fatigued him.\nHe perceived with dismay that the sort of frightful calm which the\ninjustice of his misfortune had conferred upon him was giving way within\nhim. He asked himself what would replace this. At times he would have\nactually preferred to be in prison with the gendarmes, and that things\nshould not have happened in this way; it would have agitated him less.\nAlthough the season was tolerably far advanced, there were still a few\nlate flowers in the hedge-rows here and there, whose odor as he passed\nthrough them in his march recalled to him memories of his childhood.\nThese memories were almost intolerable to him, it was so long since they\nhad recurred to him.\n\nUnutterable thoughts assembled within him in this manner all day long.\n\nAs the sun declined to its setting, casting long shadows athwart the\nsoil from every pebble, Jean Valjean sat down behind a bush upon a large\nruddy plain, which was absolutely deserted. There was nothing on the\nhorizon except the Alps. Not even the spire of a distant village. Jean\nValjean might have been three leagues distant from D---- A path which\nintersected the plain passed a few paces from the bush.\n\nIn the middle of this meditation, which would have contributed not\na little to render his rags terrifying to any one who might have\nencountered him, a joyous sound became audible.\n\nHe turned his head and saw a little Savoyard, about ten years of age,\ncoming up the path and singing, his hurdy-gurdy on his hip, and his\nmarmot-box on his back.\n\nOne of those gay and gentle children, who go from land to land affording\na view of their knees through the holes in their trousers.\n\nWithout stopping his song, the lad halted in his march from time to\ntime, and played at knuckle-bones with some coins which he had in his\nhand--his whole fortune, probably.\n\nAmong this money there was one forty-sou piece.\n\nThe child halted beside the bush, without perceiving Jean Valjean, and\ntossed up his handful of sous, which, up to that time, he had caught\nwith a good deal of adroitness on the back of his hand.\n\nThis time the forty-sou piece escaped him, and went rolling towards the\nbrushwood until it reached Jean Valjean.\n\nJean Valjean set his foot upon it.\n\nIn the meantime, the child had looked after his coin and had caught\nsight of him.\n\nHe showed no astonishment, but walked straight up to the man.\n\nThe spot was absolutely solitary. As far as the eye could see there was\nnot a person on the plain or on the path. The only sound was the tiny,\nfeeble cries of a flock of birds of passage, which was traversing the\nheavens at an immense height. The child was standing with his back to\nthe sun, which cast threads of gold in his hair and empurpled with its\nblood-red gleam the savage face of Jean Valjean.\n\n\"Sir,\" said the little Savoyard, with that childish confidence which is\ncomposed of ignorance and innocence, \"my money.\"\n\n\"What is your name?\" said Jean Valjean.\n\n\"Little Gervais, sir.\"\n\n\"Go away,\" said Jean Valjean.\n\n\"Sir,\" resumed the child, \"give me back my money.\"\n\nJean Valjean dropped his head, and made no reply.\n\nThe child began again, \"My money, sir.\"\n\nJean Valjean's eyes remained fixed on the earth.\n\n\"My piece of money!\" cried the child, \"my white piece! my silver!\"\n\nIt seemed as though Jean Valjean did not hear him. The child grasped him\nby the collar of his blouse and shook him. At the same time he made an\neffort to displace the big iron-shod shoe which rested on his treasure.\n\n\"I want my piece of money! my piece of forty sous!\"\n\nThe child wept. Jean Valjean raised his head. He still remained seated.\nHis eyes were troubled. He gazed at the child, in a sort of amazement,\nthen he stretched out his hand towards his cudgel and cried in a\nterrible voice, \"Who's there?\"\n\n\"I, sir,\" replied the child. \"Little Gervais! I! Give me back my forty\nsous, if you please! Take your foot away, sir, if you please!\"\n\nThen irritated, though he was so small, and becoming almost menacing:--\n\n\"Come now, will you take your foot away? Take your foot away, or we'll\nsee!\"\n\n\"Ah! It's still you!\" said Jean Valjean, and rising abruptly to his\nfeet, his foot still resting on the silver piece, he added:--\n\n\"Will you take yourself off!\"\n\nThe frightened child looked at him, then began to tremble from head to\nfoot, and after a few moments of stupor he set out, running at the top\nof his speed, without daring to turn his neck or to utter a cry.\n\nNevertheless, lack of breath forced him to halt after a certain\ndistance, and Jean Valjean heard him sobbing, in the midst of his own\nrevery.\n\nAt the end of a few moments the child had disappeared.\n\nThe sun had set.\n\nThe shadows were descending around Jean Valjean. He had eaten nothing\nall day; it is probable that he was feverish.\n\nHe had remained standing and had not changed his attitude after the\nchild's flight. The breath heaved his chest at long and irregular\nintervals. His gaze, fixed ten or twelve paces in front of him, seemed\nto be scrutinizing with profound attention the shape of an ancient\nfragment of blue earthenware which had fallen in the grass. All at once\nhe shivered; he had just begun to feel the chill of evening.\n\nHe settled his cap more firmly on his brow, sought mechanically to\ncross and button his blouse, advanced a step and stopped to pick up his\ncudgel.\n\nAt that moment he caught sight of the forty-sou piece, which his foot\nhad half ground into the earth, and which was shining among the pebbles.\nIt was as though he had received a galvanic shock. \"What is this?\"\nhe muttered between his teeth. He recoiled three paces, then halted,\nwithout being able to detach his gaze from the spot which his foot had\ntrodden but an instant before, as though the thing which lay glittering\nthere in the gloom had been an open eye riveted upon him.\n\nAt the expiration of a few moments he darted convulsively towards the\nsilver coin, seized it, and straightened himself up again and began to\ngaze afar off over the plain, at the same time casting his eyes towards\nall points of the horizon, as he stood there erect and shivering, like a\nterrified wild animal which is seeking refuge.\n\nHe saw nothing. Night was falling, the plain was cold and vague, great\nbanks of violet haze were rising in the gleam of the twilight.\n\nHe said, \"Ah!\" and set out rapidly in the direction in which the child\nhad disappeared. After about thirty paces he paused, looked about him\nand saw nothing.\n\nThen he shouted with all his might:--\n\n\"Little Gervais! Little Gervais!\"\n\nHe paused and waited.\n\nThere was no reply.\n\nThe landscape was gloomy and deserted. He was encompassed by space.\nThere was nothing around him but an obscurity in which his gaze was\nlost, and a silence which engulfed his voice.\n\nAn icy north wind was blowing, and imparted to things around him a\nsort of lugubrious life. The bushes shook their thin little arms with\nincredible fury. One would have said that they were threatening and\npursuing some one.\n\nHe set out on his march again, then he began to run; and from time to\ntime he halted and shouted into that solitude, with a voice which was\nthe most formidable and the most disconsolate that it was possible to\nhear, \"Little Gervais! Little Gervais!\"\n\nAssuredly, if the child had heard him, he would have been alarmed and\nwould have taken good care not to show himself. But the child was no\ndoubt already far away.\n\nHe encountered a priest on horseback. He stepped up to him and said:--\n\n\"Monsieur le Cure, have you seen a child pass?\"\n\n\"No,\" said the priest.\n\n\"One named Little Gervais?\"\n\n\"I have seen no one.\"\n\nHe drew two five-franc pieces from his money-bag and handed them to the\npriest.\n\n\"Monsieur le Cure, this is for your poor people. Monsieur le Cure, he\nwas a little lad, about ten years old, with a marmot, I think, and a\nhurdy-gurdy. One of those Savoyards, you know?\"\n\n\"I have not seen him.\"\n\n\"Little Gervais? There are no villages here? Can you tell me?\"\n\n\"If he is like what you say, my friend, he is a little stranger. Such\npersons pass through these parts. We know nothing of them.\"\n\nJean Valjean seized two more coins of five francs each with violence,\nand gave them to the priest.\n\n\"For your poor,\" he said.\n\nThen he added, wildly:--\n\n\"Monsieur l'Abbe, have me arrested. I am a thief.\"\n\nThe priest put spurs to his horse and fled in haste, much alarmed.\n\nJean Valjean set out on a run, in the direction which he had first\ntaken.\n\nIn this way he traversed a tolerably long distance, gazing, calling,\nshouting, but he met no one. Two or three times he ran across the plain\ntowards something which conveyed to him the effect of a human being\nreclining or crouching down; it turned out to be nothing but brushwood\nor rocks nearly on a level with the earth. At length, at a spot where\nthree paths intersected each other, he stopped. The moon had risen. He\nsent his gaze into the distance and shouted for the last time, \"Little\nGervais! Little Gervais! Little Gervais!\" His shout died away in the\nmist, without even awakening an echo. He murmured yet once more, \"Little\nGervais!\" but in a feeble and almost inarticulate voice. It was his last\neffort; his legs gave way abruptly under him, as though an invisible\npower had suddenly overwhelmed him with the weight of his evil\nconscience; he fell exhausted, on a large stone, his fists clenched in\nhis hair and his face on his knees, and he cried, \"I am a wretch!\"\n\nThen his heart burst, and he began to cry. It was the first time that he\nhad wept in nineteen years.\n\nWhen Jean Valjean left the Bishop's house, he was, as we have seen,\nquite thrown out of everything that had been his thought hitherto. He\ncould not yield to the evidence of what was going on within him. He\nhardened himself against the angelic action and the gentle words of the\nold man. \"You have promised me to become an honest man. I buy your soul.\nI take it away from the spirit of perversity; I give it to the good\nGod.\"\n\nThis recurred to his mind unceasingly. To this celestial kindness\nhe opposed pride, which is the fortress of evil within us. He was\nindistinctly conscious that the pardon of this priest was the greatest\nassault and the most formidable attack which had moved him yet; that his\nobduracy was finally settled if he resisted this clemency; that if he\nyielded, he should be obliged to renounce that hatred with which the\nactions of other men had filled his soul through so many years, and\nwhich pleased him; that this time it was necessary to conquer or to be\nconquered; and that a struggle, a colossal and final struggle, had been\nbegun between his viciousness and the goodness of that man.\n\nIn the presence of these lights, he proceeded like a man who is\nintoxicated. As he walked thus with haggard eyes, did he have a distinct\nperception of what might result to him from his adventure at D----? Did\nhe understand all those mysterious murmurs which warn or importune the\nspirit at certain moments of life? Did a voice whisper in his ear that\nhe had just passed the solemn hour of his destiny; that there no longer\nremained a middle course for him; that if he were not henceforth the\nbest of men, he would be the worst; that it behooved him now, so to\nspeak, to mount higher than the Bishop, or fall lower than the convict;\nthat if he wished to become good be must become an angel; that if he\nwished to remain evil, he must become a monster?\n\nHere, again, some questions must be put, which we have already put\nto ourselves elsewhere: did he catch some shadow of all this in his\nthought, in a confused way? Misfortune certainly, as we have said, does\nform the education of the intelligence; nevertheless, it is doubtful\nwhether Jean Valjean was in a condition to disentangle all that we have\nhere indicated. If these ideas occurred to him, he but caught glimpses\nof, rather than saw them, and they only succeeded in throwing him into\nan unutterable and almost painful state of emotion. On emerging from\nthat black and deformed thing which is called the galleys, the Bishop\nhad hurt his soul, as too vivid a light would have hurt his eyes on\nemerging from the dark. The future life, the possible life which offered\nitself to him henceforth, all pure and radiant, filled him with tremors\nand anxiety. He no longer knew where he really was. Like an owl, who\nshould suddenly see the sun rise, the convict had been dazzled and\nblinded, as it were, by virtue.\n\nThat which was certain, that which he did not doubt, was that he was no\nlonger the same man, that everything about him was changed, that it was\nno longer in his power to make it as though the Bishop had not spoken to\nhim and had not touched him.\n\nIn this state of mind he had encountered little Gervais, and had robbed\nhim of his forty sous. Why? He certainly could not have explained it;\nwas this the last effect and the supreme effort, as it were, of the\nevil thoughts which he had brought away from the galleys,--a remnant of\nimpulse, a result of what is called in statics, acquired force? It\nwas that, and it was also, perhaps, even less than that. Let us say it\nsimply, it was not he who stole; it was not the man; it was the beast,\nwho, by habit and instinct, had simply placed his foot upon that money,\nwhile the intelligence was struggling amid so many novel and hitherto\nunheard-of thoughts besetting it.\n\nWhen intelligence re-awakened and beheld that action of the brute, Jean\nValjean recoiled with anguish and uttered a cry of terror.\n\n[Illustration: Awakened  1b2-11-awakened]\n\nIt was because,--strange phenomenon, and one which was possible only\nin the situation in which he found himself,--in stealing the money from\nthat child, he had done a thing of which he was no longer capable.\n\nHowever that may be, this last evil action had a decisive effect on\nhim; it abruptly traversed that chaos which he bore in his mind, and\ndispersed it, placed on one side the thick obscurity, and on the other\nthe light, and acted on his soul, in the state in which it then was, as\ncertain chemical reagents act upon a troubled mixture by precipitating\none element and clarifying the other.\n\nFirst of all, even before examining himself and reflecting, all\nbewildered, like one who seeks to save himself, he tried to find the\nchild in order to return his money to him; then, when he recognized the\nfact that this was impossible, he halted in despair. At the moment when\nhe exclaimed \"I am a wretch!\" he had just perceived what he was, and he\nwas already separated from himself to such a degree, that he seemed to\nhimself to be no longer anything more than a phantom, and as if he had,\nthere before him, in flesh and blood, the hideous galley-convict, Jean\nValjean, cudgel in hand, his blouse on his hips, his knapsack filled\nwith stolen objects on his back, with his resolute and gloomy visage,\nwith his thoughts filled with abominable projects.\n\nExcess of unhappiness had, as we have remarked, made him in some sort\na visionary. This, then, was in the nature of a vision. He actually saw\nthat Jean Valjean, that sinister face, before him. He had almost reached\nthe point of asking himself who that man was, and he was horrified by\nhim.\n\nHis brain was going through one of those violent and yet perfectly calm\nmoments in which revery is so profound that it absorbs reality. One no\nlonger beholds the object which one has before one, and one sees, as\nthough apart from one's self, the figures which one has in one's own\nmind.\n\nThus he contemplated himself, so to speak, face to face, and at the same\ntime, athwart this hallucination, he perceived in a mysterious depth a\nsort of light which he at first took for a torch. On scrutinizing\nthis light which appeared to his conscience with more attention, he\nrecognized the fact that it possessed a human form and that this torch\nwas the Bishop.\n\nHis conscience weighed in turn these two men thus placed before it,--the\nBishop and Jean Valjean. Nothing less than the first was required to\nsoften the second. By one of those singular effects, which are peculiar\nto this sort of ecstasies, in proportion as his revery continued, as the\nBishop grew great and resplendent in his eyes, so did Jean Valjean grow\nless and vanish. After a certain time he was no longer anything more\nthan a shade. All at once he disappeared. The Bishop alone remained; he\nfilled the whole soul of this wretched man with a magnificent radiance.\n\nJean Valjean wept for a long time. He wept burning tears, he sobbed with\nmore weakness than a woman, with more fright than a child.\n\nAs he wept, daylight penetrated more and more clearly into his soul; an\nextraordinary light; a light at once ravishing and terrible. His past\nlife, his first fault, his long expiation, his external brutishness, his\ninternal hardness, his dismissal to liberty, rejoicing in manifold plans\nof vengeance, what had happened to him at the Bishop's, the last thing\nthat he had done, that theft of forty sous from a child, a crime all the\nmore cowardly, and all the more monstrous since it had come after the\nBishop's pardon,--all this recurred to his mind and appeared clearly\nto him, but with a clearness which he had never hitherto witnessed.\nHe examined his life, and it seemed horrible to him; his soul, and it\nseemed frightful to him. In the meantime a gentle light rested over this\nlife and this soul. It seemed to him that he beheld Satan by the light\nof Paradise.\n\nHow many hours did he weep thus? What did he do after he had wept?\nWhither did he go! No one ever knew. The only thing which seems to be\nauthenticated is that that same night the carrier who served Grenoble at\nthat epoch, and who arrived at D---- about three o'clock in the morning,\nsaw, as he traversed the street in which the Bishop's residence was\nsituated, a man in the attitude of prayer, kneeling on the pavement in\nthe shadow, in front of the door of Monseigneur Welcome.\n\n\n\n\nBOOK THIRD.--IN THE YEAR 1817\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I--THE YEAR 1817\n\n\n1817 is the year which Louis XVIII., with a certain royal assurance\nwhich was not wanting in pride, entitled the twenty-second of his reign.\nIt is the year in which M. Bruguiere de Sorsum was celebrated. All the\nhairdressers' shops, hoping for powder and the return of the royal bird,\nwere besmeared with azure and decked with fleurs-de-lys. It was the\ncandid time at which Count Lynch sat every Sunday as church-warden in\nthe church-warden's pew of Saint-Germain-des-Pres, in his costume of a\npeer of France, with his red ribbon and his long nose and the majesty\nof profile peculiar to a man who has performed a brilliant action.\nThe brilliant action performed by M. Lynch was this: being mayor of\nBordeaux, on the 12th of March, 1814, he had surrendered the city a\nlittle too promptly to M. the Duke d'Angouleme. Hence his peerage. In\n1817 fashion swallowed up little boys of from four to six years of\nage in vast caps of morocco leather with ear-tabs resembling Esquimaux\nmitres. The French army was dressed in white, after the mode of the\nAustrian; the regiments were called legions; instead of numbers they\nbore the names of departments; Napoleon was at St. Helena; and since\nEngland refused him green cloth, he was having his old coats turned.\nIn 1817 Pelligrini sang; Mademoiselle Bigottini danced; Potier reigned;\nOdry did not yet exist. Madame Saqui had succeeded to Forioso. There\nwere still Prussians in France. M. Delalot was a personage. Legitimacy\nhad just asserted itself by cutting off the hand, then the head, of\nPleignier, of Carbonneau, and of Tolleron. The Prince de Talleyrand,\ngrand chamberlain, and the Abbe Louis, appointed minister of finance,\nlaughed as they looked at each other, with the laugh of the two augurs;\nboth of them had celebrated, on the 14th of July, 1790, the mass of\nfederation in the Champ de Mars; Talleyrand had said it as bishop, Louis\nhad served it in the capacity of deacon. In 1817, in the side-alleys\nof this same Champ de Mars, two great cylinders of wood might have\nbeen seen lying in the rain, rotting amid the grass, painted blue, with\ntraces of eagles and bees, from which the gilding was falling. These\nwere the columns which two years before had upheld the Emperor's\nplatform in the Champ de Mai. They were blackened here and there with\nthe scorches of the bivouac of Austrians encamped near Gros-Caillou. Two\nor three of these columns had disappeared in these bivouac fires, and\nhad warmed the large hands of the Imperial troops. The Field of May had\nthis remarkable point: that it had been held in the month of June and in\nthe Field of March (Mars). In this year, 1817, two things were popular:\nthe Voltaire-Touquet and the snuff-box a la Charter. The most recent\nParisian sensation was the crime of Dautun, who had thrown his brother's\nhead into the fountain of the Flower-Market.\n\nThey had begun to feel anxious at the Naval Department, on account of\nthe lack of news from that fatal frigate, The Medusa, which was destined\nto cover Chaumareix with infamy and Gericault with glory. Colonel Selves\nwas going to Egypt to become Soliman-Pasha. The palace of Thermes, in\nthe Rue de La Harpe, served as a shop for a cooper. On the platform of\nthe octagonal tower of the Hotel de Cluny, the little shed of boards,\nwhich had served as an observatory to Messier, the naval astronomer\nunder Louis XVI., was still to be seen. The Duchesse de Duras read to\nthree or four friends her unpublished Ourika, in her boudoir furnished\nby X. in sky-blue satin. The N's were scratched off the Louvre. The\nbridge of Austerlitz had abdicated, and was entitled the bridge of the\nKing's Garden [du Jardin du Roi], a double enigma, which disguised the\nbridge of Austerlitz and the Jardin des Plantes at one stroke. Louis\nXVIII., much preoccupied while annotating Horace with the corner of his\nfinger-nail, heroes who have become emperors, and makers of wooden shoes\nwho have become dauphins, had two anxieties,--Napoleon and Mathurin\nBruneau. The French Academy had given for its prize subject, The\nHappiness procured through Study. M. Bellart was officially eloquent.\nIn his shadow could be seen germinating that future advocate-general of\nBroe, dedicated to the sarcasms of Paul-Louis Courier. There was a false\nChateaubriand, named Marchangy, in the interim, until there should be a\nfalse Marchangy, named d'Arlincourt. Claire d'Albe and Malek-Adel were\nmasterpieces; Madame Cottin was proclaimed the chief writer of the\nepoch. The Institute had the academician, Napoleon Bonaparte, stricken\nfrom its list of members. A royal ordinance erected Angouleme into a\nnaval school; for the Duc d'Angouleme, being lord high admiral, it was\nevident that the city of Angouleme had all the qualities of a seaport;\notherwise the monarchical principle would have received a wound. In\nthe Council of Ministers the question was agitated whether vignettes\nrepresenting slack-rope performances, which adorned Franconi's\nadvertising posters, and which attracted throngs of street urchins,\nshould be tolerated. M. Paer, the author of Agnese, a good sort of\nfellow, with a square face and a wart on his cheek, directed the little\nprivate concerts of the Marquise de Sasenaye in the Rue Ville l'Eveque.\nAll the young girls were singing the Hermit of Saint-Avelle, with words\nby Edmond Geraud. The Yellow Dwarf was transferred into Mirror. The Cafe\nLemblin stood up for the Emperor, against the Cafe Valois, which upheld\nthe Bourbons. The Duc de Berri, already surveyed from the shadow by\nLouvel, had just been married to a princess of Sicily. Madame de Stael\nhad died a year previously. The body-guard hissed Mademoiselle Mars.\nThe grand newspapers were all very small. Their form was restricted,\nbut their liberty was great. The Constitutionnel was constitutional.\nLa Minerve called Chateaubriand Chateaubriant. That made the good\nmiddle-class people laugh heartily at the expense of the great writer.\nIn journals which sold themselves, prostituted journalists, insulted the\nexiles of 1815. David had no longer any talent, Arnault had no longer\nany wit, Carnot was no longer honest, Soult had won no battles; it is\ntrue that Napoleon had no longer any genius. No one is ignorant of the\nfact that letters sent to an exile by post very rarely reached him, as\nthe police made it their religious duty to intercept them. This is no\nnew fact; Descartes complained of it in his exile. Now David, having, in\na Belgian publication, shown some displeasure at not receiving letters\nwhich had been written to him, it struck the royalist journals as\namusing; and they derided the prescribed man well on this occasion. What\nseparated two men more than an abyss was to say, the regicides, or\nto say the voters; to say the enemies, or to say the allies; to say\nNapoleon, or to say Buonaparte. All sensible people were agreed that the\nera of revolution had been closed forever by King Louis XVIII., surnamed\n\"The Immortal Author of the Charter.\" On the platform of the Pont-Neuf,\nthe word Redivivus was carved on the pedestal that awaited the statue of\nHenry IV. M. Piet, in the Rue Therese, No. 4, was making the rough draft\nof his privy assembly to consolidate the monarchy. The leaders of the\nRight said at grave conjunctures, \"We must write to Bacot.\" MM. Canuel,\nO'Mahoney, and De Chappedelaine were preparing the sketch, to some\nextent with Monsieur's approval, of what was to become later on \"The\nConspiracy of the Bord de l'Eau\"--of the waterside. L'Epingle Noire was\nalready plotting in his own quarter. Delaverderie was conferring with\nTrogoff. M. Decazes, who was liberal to a degree, reigned. Chateaubriand\nstood every morning at his window at No. 27 Rue Saint-Dominique, clad in\nfooted trousers, and slippers, with a madras kerchief knotted over his\ngray hair, with his eyes fixed on a mirror, a complete set of dentist's\ninstruments spread out before him, cleaning his teeth, which were\ncharming, while he dictated The Monarchy according to the Charter to\nM. Pilorge, his secretary. Criticism, assuming an authoritative tone,\npreferred Lafon to Talma. M. de Feletez signed himself A.; M. Hoffmann\nsigned himself Z. Charles Nodier wrote Therese Aubert. Divorce was\nabolished. Lyceums called themselves colleges. The collegians, decorated\non the collar with a golden fleur-de-lys, fought each other apropos of\nthe King of Rome. The counter-police of the chateau had denounced to her\nRoyal Highness Madame, the portrait, everywhere exhibited, of M. the\nDuc d'Orleans, who made a better appearance in his uniform of a\ncolonel-general of hussars than M. the Duc de Berri, in his uniform of\ncolonel-general of dragoons--a serious inconvenience. The city of\nParis was having the dome of the Invalides regilded at its own expense.\nSerious men asked themselves what M. de Trinquelague would do on such or\nsuch an occasion; M. Clausel de Montals differed on divers points\nfrom M. Clausel de Coussergues; M. de Salaberry was not satisfied. The\ncomedian Picard, who belonged to the Academy, which the comedian Moliere\nhad not been able to do, had The Two Philiberts played at the Odeon,\nupon whose pediment the removal of the letters still allowed THEATRE OF\nTHE EMPRESS to be plainly read. People took part for or against Cugnet\nde Montarlot. Fabvier was factious; Bavoux was revolutionary. The\nLiberal, Pelicier, published an edition of Voltaire, with the following\ntitle: Works of Voltaire, of the French Academy. \"That will attract\npurchasers,\" said the ingenious editor. The general opinion was that M.\nCharles Loyson would be the genius of the century; envy was beginning to\ngnaw at him--a sign of glory; and this verse was composed on him:--\n\n     \"Even when Loyson steals, one feels that he has paws.\"\n\nAs Cardinal Fesch refused to resign, M. de Pins, Archbishop of Amasie,\nadministered the diocese of Lyons. The quarrel over the valley of Dappes\nwas begun between Switzerland and France by a memoir from Captain,\nafterwards General Dufour. Saint-Simon, ignored, was erecting his\nsublime dream. There was a celebrated Fourier at the Academy of Science,\nwhom posterity has forgotten; and in some garret an obscure Fourier,\nwhom the future will recall. Lord Byron was beginning to make his mark;\na note to a poem by Millevoye introduced him to France in these terms:\na certain Lord Baron. David d'Angers was trying to work in marble. The\nAbbe Caron was speaking, in terms of praise, to a private gathering of\nseminarists in the blind alley of Feuillantines, of an unknown priest,\nnamed Felicite-Robert, who, at a latter date, became Lamennais. A thing\nwhich smoked and clattered on the Seine with the noise of a swimming dog\nwent and came beneath the windows of the Tuileries, from the Pont Royal\nto the Pont Louis XV.; it was a piece of mechanism which was not\ngood for much; a sort of plaything, the idle dream of a dream-ridden\ninventor; an utopia--a steamboat. The Parisians stared indifferently at\nthis useless thing. M. de Vaublanc, the reformer of the Institute by\na coup d'etat, the distinguished author of numerous academicians,\nordinances, and batches of members, after having created them, could\nnot succeed in becoming one himself. The Faubourg Saint-Germain and the\npavilion de Marsan wished to have M. Delaveau for prefect of police, on\naccount of his piety. Dupuytren and Recamier entered into a quarrel in\nthe amphitheatre of the School of Medicine, and threatened each other\nwith their fists on the subject of the divinity of Jesus Christ. Cuvier,\nwith one eye on Genesis and the other on nature, tried to please bigoted\nreaction by reconciling fossils with texts and by making mastodons\nflatter Moses.\n\nM. Francois de Neufchateau, the praiseworthy cultivator of the memory\nof Parmentier, made a thousand efforts to have pomme de terre [potato]\npronounced parmentiere, and succeeded therein not at all. The Abbe\nGregoire, ex-bishop, ex-conventionary, ex-senator, had passed, in the\nroyalist polemics, to the state of \"Infamous Gregoire.\" The locution of\nwhich we have made use--passed to the state of--has been condemned as a\nneologism by M. Royer Collard. Under the third arch of the Pont de Jena,\nthe new stone with which, the two years previously, the mining aperture\nmade by Blucher to blow up the bridge had been stopped up, was still\nrecognizable on account of its whiteness. Justice summoned to its bar a\nman who, on seeing the Comte d'Artois enter Notre Dame, had said aloud:\n\"Sapristi! I regret the time when I saw Bonaparte and Talma enter the\nBel Sauvage, arm in arm.\" A seditious utterance. Six months in prison.\nTraitors showed themselves unbuttoned; men who had gone over to the\nenemy on the eve of battle made no secret of their recompense, and\nstrutted immodestly in the light of day, in the cynicism of riches and\ndignities; deserters from Ligny and Quatre-Bras, in the brazenness of\ntheir well-paid turpitude, exhibited their devotion to the monarchy in\nthe most barefaced manner.\n\nThis is what floats up confusedly, pell-mell, for the year 1817, and is\nnow forgotten. History neglects nearly all these particulars, and cannot\ndo otherwise; the infinity would overwhelm it. Nevertheless, these\ndetails, which are wrongly called trivial,--there are no trivial facts\nin humanity, nor little leaves in vegetation,--are useful. It is of\nthe physiognomy of the years that the physiognomy of the centuries is\ncomposed. In this year of 1817 four young Parisians arranged \"a fine\nfarce.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II--A DOUBLE QUARTETTE\n\n\nThese Parisians came, one from Toulouse, another from Limoges, the third\nfrom Cahors, and the fourth from Montauban; but they were students; and\nwhen one says student, one says Parisian: to study in Paris is to be\nborn in Paris.\n\nThese young men were insignificant; every one has seen such faces; four\nspecimens of humanity taken at random; neither good nor bad, neither\nwise nor ignorant, neither geniuses nor fools; handsome, with that\ncharming April which is called twenty years. They were four Oscars; for,\nat that epoch, Arthurs did not yet exist. Burn for him the perfumes of\nAraby! exclaimed romance. Oscar advances. Oscar, I shall behold him!\nPeople had just emerged from Ossian; elegance was Scandinavian and\nCaledonian; the pure English style was only to prevail later, and\nthe first of the Arthurs, Wellington, had but just won the battle of\nWaterloo.\n\nThese Oscars bore the names, one of Felix Tholomyes, of Toulouse; the\nsecond, Listolier, of Cahors; the next, Fameuil, of Limoges; the last,\nBlachevelle, of Montauban. Naturally, each of them had his mistress.\nBlachevelle loved Favourite, so named because she had been in England;\nListolier adored Dahlia, who had taken for her nickname the name of a\nflower; Fameuil idolized Zephine, an abridgment of Josephine; Tholomyes\nhad Fantine, called the Blonde, because of her beautiful, sunny hair.\n\nFavourite, Dahlia, Zephine, and Fantine were four ravishing young women,\nperfumed and radiant, still a little like working-women, and not yet\nentirely divorced from their needles; somewhat disturbed by intrigues,\nbut still retaining on their faces something of the serenity of toil,\nand in their souls that flower of honesty which survives the first fall\nin woman. One of the four was called the young, because she was\nthe youngest of them, and one was called the old; the old one was\ntwenty-three. Not to conceal anything, the three first were more\nexperienced, more heedless, and more emancipated into the tumult of life\nthan Fantine the Blonde, who was still in her first illusions.\n\nDahlia, Zephine, and especially Favourite, could not have said as much.\nThere had already been more than one episode in their romance, though\nhardly begun; and the lover who had borne the name of Adolph in the\nfirst chapter had turned out to be Alphonse in the second, and Gustave\nin the third. Poverty and coquetry are two fatal counsellors; one scolds\nand the other flatters, and the beautiful daughters of the people have\nboth of them whispering in their ear, each on its own side. These badly\nguarded souls listen. Hence the falls which they accomplish, and the\nstones which are thrown at them. They are overwhelmed with splendor of\nall that is immaculate and inaccessible. Alas! what if the Jungfrau were\nhungry?\n\nFavourite having been in England, was admired by Dahlia and Zephine. She\nhad had an establishment of her own very early in life. Her father was\nan old unmarried professor of mathematics, a brutal man and a braggart,\nwho went out to give lessons in spite of his age. This professor, when\nhe was a young man, had one day seen a chambermaid's gown catch on\na fender; he had fallen in love in consequence of this accident. The\nresult had been Favourite. She met her father from time to time, and he\nbowed to her. One morning an old woman with the air of a devotee,\nhad entered her apartments, and had said to her, \"You do not know me,\nMamemoiselle?\" \"No.\" \"I am your mother.\" Then the old woman opened the\nsideboard, and ate and drank, had a mattress which she owned brought in,\nand installed herself. This cross and pious old mother never spoke to\nFavourite, remained hours without uttering a word, breakfasted, dined,\nand supped for four, and went down to the porter's quarters for company,\nwhere she spoke ill of her daughter.\n\nIt was having rosy nails that were too pretty which had drawn Dahlia to\nListolier, to others perhaps, to idleness. How could she make such nails\nwork? She who wishes to remain virtuous must not have pity on her hands.\nAs for Zephine, she had conquered Fameuil by her roguish and caressing\nlittle way of saying \"Yes, sir.\"\n\nThe young men were comrades; the young girls were friends. Such loves\nare always accompanied by such friendships.\n\nGoodness and philosophy are two distinct things; the proof of this\nis that, after making all due allowances for these little irregular\nhouseholds, Favourite, Zephine, and Dahlia were philosophical young\nwomen, while Fantine was a good girl.\n\nGood! some one will exclaim; and Tholomyes? Solomon would reply that\nlove forms a part of wisdom. We will confine ourselves to saying that\nthe love of Fantine was a first love, a sole love, a faithful love.\n\nShe alone, of all the four, was not called \"thou\" by a single one of\nthem.\n\nFantine was one of those beings who blossom, so to speak, from the dregs\nof the people. Though she had emerged from the most unfathomable depths\nof social shadow, she bore on her brow the sign of the anonymous and the\nunknown. She was born at M. sur M. Of what parents? Who can say? She had\nnever known father or mother. She was called Fantine. Why Fantine? She\nhad never borne any other name. At the epoch of her birth the Directory\nstill existed. She had no family name; she had no family; no baptismal\nname; the Church no longer existed. She bore the name which pleased\nthe first random passer-by, who had encountered her, when a very small\nchild, running bare-legged in the street. She received the name as she\nreceived the water from the clouds upon her brow when it rained. She was\ncalled little Fantine. No one knew more than that. This human creature\nhad entered life in just this way. At the age of ten, Fantine quitted\nthe town and went to service with some farmers in the neighborhood. At\nfifteen she came to Paris \"to seek her fortune.\" Fantine was beautiful,\nand remained pure as long as she could. She was a lovely blonde, with\nfine teeth. She had gold and pearls for her dowry; but her gold was on\nher head, and her pearls were in her mouth.\n\nShe worked for her living; then, still for the sake of her living,--for\nthe heart, also, has its hunger,--she loved.\n\nShe loved Tholomyes.\n\nAn amour for him; passion for her. The streets of the Latin quarter,\nfilled with throngs of students and grisettes, saw the beginning of\ntheir dream. Fantine had long evaded Tholomyes in the mazes of the hill\nof the Pantheon, where so many adventurers twine and untwine, but in\nsuch a way as constantly to encounter him again. There is a way of\navoiding which resembles seeking. In short, the eclogue took place.\n\nBlachevelle, Listolier, and Fameuil formed a sort of group of which\nTholomyes was the head. It was he who possessed the wit.\n\nTholomyes was the antique old student; he was rich; he had an income of\nfour thousand francs; four thousand francs! a splendid scandal on\nMount Sainte-Genevieve. Tholomyes was a fast man of thirty, and badly\npreserved. He was wrinkled and toothless, and he had the beginning of a\nbald spot, of which he himself said with sadness, the skull at thirty,\nthe knee at forty. His digestion was mediocre, and he had been attacked\nby a watering in one eye. But in proportion as his youth disappeared,\ngayety was kindled; he replaced his teeth with buffooneries, his hair\nwith mirth, his health with irony, his weeping eye laughed incessantly.\nHe was dilapidated but still in flower. His youth, which was packing\nup for departure long before its time, beat a retreat in good order,\nbursting with laughter, and no one saw anything but fire. He had had a\npiece rejected at the Vaudeville. He made a few verses now and then. In\naddition to this he doubted everything to the last degree, which is a\nvast force in the eyes of the weak. Being thus ironical and bald, he\nwas the leader. Iron is an English word. Is it possible that irony is\nderived from it?\n\nOne day Tholomyes took the three others aside, with the gesture of an\noracle, and said to them:--\n\n\"Fantine, Dahlia, Zephine, and Favourite have been teasing us for nearly\na year to give them a surprise. We have promised them solemnly that we\nwould. They are forever talking about it to us, to me in particular,\njust as the old women in Naples cry to Saint Januarius, 'Faccia\ngialluta, fa o miracolo, Yellow face, perform thy miracle,' so our\nbeauties say to me incessantly, 'Tholomyes, when will you bring forth\nyour surprise?' At the same time our parents keep writing to us.\nPressure on both sides. The moment has arrived, it seems to me; let us\ndiscuss the question.\"\n\nThereupon, Tholomyes lowered his voice and articulated something so\nmirthful, that a vast and enthusiastic grin broke out upon the four\nmouths simultaneously, and Blachevelle exclaimed, \"That is an idea.\"\n\nA smoky tap-room presented itself; they entered, and the remainder of\ntheir confidential colloquy was lost in shadow.\n\nThe result of these shades was a dazzling pleasure party which took\nplace on the following Sunday, the four young men inviting the four\nyoung girls.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III--FOUR AND FOUR\n\nIt is hard nowadays to picture to one's self what a pleasure-trip of\nstudents and grisettes to the country was like, forty-five years ago.\nThe suburbs of Paris are no longer the same; the physiognomy of what\nmay be called circumparisian life has changed completely in the last\nhalf-century; where there was the cuckoo, there is the railway car;\nwhere there was a tender-boat, there is now the steamboat; people speak\nof Fecamp nowadays as they spoke of Saint-Cloud in those days. The Paris\nof 1862 is a city which has France for its outskirts.\n\nThe four couples conscientiously went through with all the country\nfollies possible at that time. The vacation was beginning, and it was a\nwarm, bright, summer day. On the preceding day, Favourite, the only one\nwho knew how to write, had written the following to Tholomyes in the\nname of the four: \"It is a good hour to emerge from happiness.\" That\nis why they rose at five o'clock in the morning. Then they went to\nSaint-Cloud by the coach, looked at the dry cascade and exclaimed, \"This\nmust be very beautiful when there is water!\" They breakfasted at the\nTete-Noir, where Castaing had not yet been; they treated themselves to a\ngame of ring-throwing under the quincunx of trees of the grand fountain;\nthey ascended Diogenes' lantern, they gambled for macaroons at the\nroulette establishment of the Pont de Sevres, picked bouquets at\nPateaux, bought reed-pipes at Neuilly, ate apple tarts everywhere, and\nwere perfectly happy.\n\nThe young girls rustled and chatted like warblers escaped from their\ncage. It was a perfect delirium. From time to time they bestowed little\ntaps on the young men. Matutinal intoxication of life! adorable years!\nthe wings of the dragonfly quiver. Oh, whoever you may be, do you not\nremember? Have you rambled through the brushwood, holding aside the\nbranches, on account of the charming head which is coming on behind you?\nHave you slid, laughing, down a slope all wet with rain, with a beloved\nwoman holding your hand, and crying, \"Ah, my new boots! what a state\nthey are in!\"\n\nLet us say at once that that merry obstacle, a shower, was lacking in\nthe case of this good-humored party, although Favourite had said as they\nset out, with a magisterial and maternal tone, \"The slugs are crawling\nin the paths,--a sign of rain, children.\"\n\nAll four were madly pretty. A good old classic poet, then famous, a good\nfellow who had an Eleonore, M. le Chevalier de Labouisse, as he strolled\nthat day beneath the chestnut-trees of Saint-Cloud, saw them pass about\nten o'clock in the morning, and exclaimed, \"There is one too many of\nthem,\" as he thought of the Graces. Favourite, Blachevelle's friend, the\none aged three and twenty, the old one, ran on in front under the great\ngreen boughs, jumped the ditches, stalked distractedly over bushes, and\npresided over this merry-making with the spirit of a young female faun.\nZephine and Dahlia, whom chance had made beautiful in such a way that\nthey set each off when they were together, and completed each other,\nnever left each other, more from an instinct of coquetry than from\nfriendship, and clinging to each other, they assumed English poses; the\nfirst keepsakes had just made their appearance, melancholy was dawning\nfor women, as later on, Byronism dawned for men; and the hair of the\ntender sex began to droop dolefully. Zephine and Dahlia had their hair\ndressed in rolls. Listolier and Fameuil, who were engaged in discussing\ntheir professors, explained to Fantine the difference that existed\nbetween M. Delvincourt and M. Blondeau.\n\nBlachevelle seemed to have been created expressly to carry Favourite's\nsingle-bordered, imitation India shawl of Ternaux's manufacture, on his\narm on Sundays.\n\nTholomyes followed, dominating the group. He was very gay, but one felt\nthe force of government in him; there was dictation in his joviality;\nhis principal ornament was a pair of trousers of elephant-leg pattern of\nnankeen, with straps of braided copper wire; he carried a stout rattan\nworth two hundred francs in his hand, and, as he treated himself to\neverything, a strange thing called a cigar in his mouth. Nothing was\nsacred to him; he smoked.\n\n\"That Tholomyes is astounding!\" said the others, with veneration. \"What\ntrousers! What energy!\"\n\nAs for Fantine, she was a joy to behold. Her splendid teeth had\nevidently received an office from God,--laughter. She preferred to carry\nher little hat of sewed straw, with its long white strings, in her hand\nrather than on her head. Her thick blond hair, which was inclined to\nwave, and which easily uncoiled, and which it was necessary to fasten\nup incessantly, seemed made for the flight of Galatea under the\nwillows. Her rosy lips babbled enchantingly. The corners of her mouth\nvoluptuously turned up, as in the antique masks of Erigone, had an\nair of encouraging the audacious; but her long, shadowy lashes drooped\ndiscreetly over the jollity of the lower part of the face as though to\ncall a halt. There was something indescribably harmonious and striking\nabout her entire dress. She wore a gown of mauve barege, little reddish\nbrown buskins, whose ribbons traced an X on her fine, white, open-worked\nstockings, and that sort of muslin spencer, a Marseilles invention,\nwhose name, canezou, a corruption of the words quinze aout, pronounced\nafter the fashion of the Canebiere, signifies fine weather, heat, and\nmidday. The three others, less timid, as we have already said,\nwore low-necked dresses without disguise, which in summer, beneath\nflower-adorned hats, are very graceful and enticing; but by the side\nof these audacious outfits, blond Fantine's canezou, with its\ntransparencies, its indiscretion, and its reticence, concealing and\ndisplaying at one and the same time, seemed an alluring godsend of\ndecency, and the famous Court of Love, presided over by the Vicomtesse\nde Cette, with the sea-green eyes, would, perhaps, have awarded the\nprize for coquetry to this canezou, in the contest for the prize of\nmodesty. The most ingenious is, at times, the wisest. This does happen.\n\nBrilliant of face, delicate of profile, with eyes of a deep blue, heavy\nlids, feet arched and small, wrists and ankles admirably formed, a white\nskin which, here and there allowed the azure branching of the veins to\nbe seen, joy, a cheek that was young and fresh, the robust throat of the\nJuno of AEgina, a strong and supple nape of the neck, shoulders modelled\nas though by Coustou, with a voluptuous dimple in the middle, visible\nthrough the muslin; a gayety cooled by dreaminess; sculptural and\nexquisite--such was Fantine; and beneath these feminine adornments and\nthese ribbons one could divine a statue, and in that statue a soul.\n\nFantine was beautiful, without being too conscious of it. Those rare\ndreamers, mysterious priests of the beautiful who silently confront\neverything with perfection, would have caught a glimpse in this little\nworking-woman, through the transparency of her Parisian grace, of the\nancient sacred euphony. This daughter of the shadows was thoroughbred.\nShe was beautiful in the two ways--style and rhythm. Style is the form\nof the ideal; rhythm is its movement.\n\nWe have said that Fantine was joy; she was also modesty.\n\nTo an observer who studied her attentively, that which breathed from\nher athwart all the intoxication of her age, the season, and her\nlove affair, was an invincible expression of reserve and modesty. She\nremained a little astonished. This chaste astonishment is the shade\nof difference which separates Psyche from Venus. Fantine had the long,\nwhite, fine fingers of the vestal virgin who stirs the ashes of the\nsacred fire with a golden pin. Although she would have refused nothing\nto Tholomyes, as we shall have more than ample opportunity to see, her\nface in repose was supremely virginal; a sort of serious and almost\naustere dignity suddenly overwhelmed her at certain times, and there\nwas nothing more singular and disturbing than to see gayety become so\nsuddenly extinct there, and meditation succeed to cheerfulness without\nany transition state. This sudden and sometimes severely accentuated\ngravity resembled the disdain of a goddess. Her brow, her nose, her\nchin, presented that equilibrium of outline which is quite distinct\nfrom equilibrium of proportion, and from which harmony of countenance\nresults; in the very characteristic interval which separates the base\nof the nose from the upper lip, she had that imperceptible and charming\nfold, a mysterious sign of chastity, which makes Barberousse fall in\nlove with a Diana found in the treasures of Iconia.\n\nLove is a fault; so be it. Fantine was innocence floating high over\nfault.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV--THOLOMYES IS SO MERRY THAT HE SINGS A SPANISH DITTY\n\n\nThat day was composed of dawn, from one end to the other. All nature\nseemed to be having a holiday, and to be laughing. The flower-beds of\nSaint-Cloud perfumed the air; the breath of the Seine rustled the\nleaves vaguely; the branches gesticulated in the wind, bees pillaged the\njasmines; a whole bohemia of butterflies swooped down upon the yarrow,\nthe clover, and the sterile oats; in the august park of the King of\nFrance there was a pack of vagabonds, the birds.\n\nThe four merry couples, mingled with the sun, the fields, the flowers,\nthe trees, were resplendent.\n\nAnd in this community of Paradise, talking, singing, running, dancing,\nchasing butterflies, plucking convolvulus, wetting their pink, open-work\nstockings in the tall grass, fresh, wild, without malice, all received,\nto some extent, the kisses of all, with the exception of Fantine,\nwho was hedged about with that vague resistance of hers composed of\ndreaminess and wildness, and who was in love. \"You always have a queer\nlook about you,\" said Favourite to her.\n\nSuch things are joys. These passages of happy couples are a profound\nappeal to life and nature, and make a caress and light spring forth from\neverything. There was once a fairy who created the fields and forests\nexpressly for those in love,--in that eternal hedge-school of lovers,\nwhich is forever beginning anew, and which will last as long as there\nare hedges and scholars. Hence the popularity of spring among thinkers.\nThe patrician and the knife-grinder, the duke and the peer, the limb\nof the law, the courtiers and townspeople, as they used to say in olden\ntimes, all are subjects of this fairy. They laugh and hunt, and there\nis in the air the brilliance of an apotheosis--what a transfiguration\neffected by love! Notaries' clerks are gods. And the little cries,\nthe pursuits through the grass, the waists embraced on the fly, those\njargons which are melodies, those adorations which burst forth in the\nmanner of pronouncing a syllable, those cherries torn from one mouth by\nanother,--all this blazes forth and takes its place among the celestial\nglories. Beautiful women waste themselves sweetly. They think that this\nwill never come to an end. Philosophers, poets, painters, observe these\necstasies and know not what to make of it, so greatly are they dazzled\nby it. The departure for Cythera! exclaims Watteau; Lancret, the painter\nof plebeians, contemplates his bourgeois, who have flitted away into the\nazure sky; Diderot stretches out his arms to all these love idyls, and\nd'Urfe mingles druids with them.\n\nAfter breakfast the four couples went to what was then called the King's\nSquare to see a newly arrived plant from India, whose name escapes our\nmemory at this moment, and which, at that epoch, was attracting all\nParis to Saint-Cloud. It was an odd and charming shrub with a long stem,\nwhose numerous branches, bristling and leafless and as fine as threads,\nwere covered with a million tiny white rosettes; this gave the shrub the\nair of a head of hair studded with flowers. There was always an admiring\ncrowd about it.\n\nAfter viewing the shrub, Tholomyes exclaimed, \"I offer you asses!\" and\nhaving agreed upon a price with the owner of the asses, they returned\nby way of Vanvres and Issy. At Issy an incident occurred. The truly\nnational park, at that time owned by Bourguin the contractor, happened\nto be wide open. They passed the gates, visited the manikin anchorite in\nhis grotto, tried the mysterious little effects of the famous cabinet\nof mirrors, the wanton trap worthy of a satyr become a millionaire or of\nTurcaret metamorphosed into a Priapus. They had stoutly shaken the swing\nattached to the two chestnut-trees celebrated by the Abbe de Bernis.\nAs he swung these beauties, one after the other, producing folds in the\nfluttering skirts which Greuze would have found to his taste, amid peals\nof laughter, the Toulousan Tholomyes, who was somewhat of a Spaniard,\nToulouse being the cousin of Tolosa, sang, to a melancholy chant, the\nold ballad gallega, probably inspired by some lovely maid dashing in\nfull flight upon a rope between two trees:--\n\n      \"Soy de Badajoz,        \"Badajoz is my home,\n       Amor me llama,          And Love is my name;\n       Toda mi alma,           To my eyes in flame,\n       Es en mi ojos,          All my soul doth come;\n       Porque ensenas,         For instruction meet\n       A tuas piernas.         I receive at thy feet\"\n\n\nFantine alone refused to swing.\n\n\"I don't like to have people put on airs like that,\" muttered Favourite,\nwith a good deal of acrimony.\n\nAfter leaving the asses there was a fresh delight; they crossed the\nSeine in a boat, and proceeding from Passy on foot they reached the\nbarrier of l'Etoile. They had been up since five o'clock that morning,\nas the reader will remember; but bah! there is no such thing as fatigue\non Sunday, said Favourite; on Sunday fatigue does not work.\n\nAbout three o'clock the four couples, frightened at their happiness,\nwere sliding down the Russian mountains, a singular edifice which then\noccupied the heights of Beaujon, and whose undulating line was visible\nabove the trees of the Champs Elysees.\n\nFrom time to time Favourite exclaimed:--\n\n\"And the surprise? I claim the surprise.\"\n\n\"Patience,\" replied Tholomyes.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V--AT BOMBARDA'S\n\nThe Russian mountains having been exhausted, they began to think about\ndinner; and the radiant party of eight, somewhat weary at last, became\nstranded in Bombarda's public house, a branch establishment which had\nbeen set up in the Champs-Elysees by that famous restaurant-keeper,\nBombarda, whose sign could then be seen in the Rue de Rivoli, near\nDelorme Alley.\n\nA large but ugly room, with an alcove and a bed at the end (they had\nbeen obliged to put up with this accommodation in view of the Sunday\ncrowd); two windows whence they could survey beyond the elms, the quay\nand the river; a magnificent August sunlight lightly touching the panes;\ntwo tables; upon one of them a triumphant mountain of bouquets, mingled\nwith the hats of men and women; at the other the four couples seated\nround a merry confusion of platters, dishes, glasses, and bottles; jugs\nof beer mingled with flasks of wine; very little order on the table,\nsome disorder beneath it;\n\n               \"They made beneath the table\n     A noise, a clatter of the feet that was abominable,\"\n\nsays Moliere.\n\nThis was the state which the shepherd idyl, begun at five o'clock in\nthe morning, had reached at half-past four in the afternoon. The sun was\nsetting; their appetites were satisfied.\n\nThe Champs-Elysees, filled with sunshine and with people, were nothing\nbut light and dust, the two things of which glory is composed. The\nhorses of Marly, those neighing marbles, were prancing in a cloud\nof gold. Carriages were going and coming. A squadron of magnificent\nbody-guards, with their clarions at their head, were descending the\nAvenue de Neuilly; the white flag, showing faintly rosy in the setting\nsun, floated over the dome of the Tuileries. The Place de la Concorde,\nwhich had become the Place Louis XV. once more, was choked with happy\npromenaders. Many wore the silver fleur-de-lys suspended from the\nwhite-watered ribbon, which had not yet wholly disappeared from\nbutton-holes in the year 1817. Here and there choruses of little girls\nthrew to the winds, amid the passersby, who formed into circles and\napplauded, the then celebrated Bourbon air, which was destined to strike\nthe Hundred Days with lightning, and which had for its refrain:--\n\n               \"Rendez-nous notre pere de Gand,\n                    Rendez-nous notre pere.\"\n\n               \"Give us back our father from Ghent,\n                    Give us back our father.\"\n\n\nGroups of dwellers in the suburbs, in Sunday array, sometimes even\ndecorated with the fleur-de-lys, like the bourgeois, scattered over the\nlarge square and the Marigny square, were playing at rings and revolving\non the wooden horses; others were engaged in drinking; some journeyman\nprinters had on paper caps; their laughter was audible. Every thing\nwas radiant. It was a time of undisputed peace and profound royalist\nsecurity; it was the epoch when a special and private report of Chief\nof Police Angeles to the King, on the subject of the suburbs of Paris,\nterminated with these lines:--\n\n\"Taking all things into consideration, Sire, there is nothing to be\nfeared from these people. They are as heedless and as indolent as cats.\nThe populace is restless in the provinces; it is not in Paris. These are\nvery pretty men, Sire. It would take all of two of them to make one\nof your grenadiers. There is nothing to be feared on the part of the\npopulace of Paris the capital. It is remarkable that the stature of\nthis population should have diminished in the last fifty years; and\nthe populace of the suburbs is still more puny than at the time of the\nRevolution. It is not dangerous. In short, it is an amiable rabble.\"\n\nPrefects of the police do not deem it possible that a cat can transform\nitself into a lion; that does happen, however, and in that lies the\nmiracle wrought by the populace of Paris. Moreover, the cat so despised\nby Count Angles possessed the esteem of the republics of old. In their\neyes it was liberty incarnate; and as though to serve as pendant to\nthe Minerva Aptera of the Piraeus, there stood on the public square in\nCorinth the colossal bronze figure of a cat. The ingenuous police of the\nRestoration beheld the populace of Paris in too \"rose-colored\" a light;\nit is not so much of \"an amiable rabble\" as it is thought. The Parisian\nis to the Frenchman what the Athenian was to the Greek: no one sleeps\nmore soundly than he, no one is more frankly frivolous and lazy than\nhe, no one can better assume the air of forgetfulness; let him not be\ntrusted nevertheless; he is ready for any sort of cool deed; but when\nthere is glory at the end of it, he is worthy of admiration in every\nsort of fury. Give him a pike, he will produce the 10th of August; give\nhim a gun, you will have Austerlitz. He is Napoleon's stay and Danton's\nresource. Is it a question of country, he enlists; is it a question of\nliberty, he tears up the pavements. Beware! his hair filled with wrath,\nis epic; his blouse drapes itself like the folds of a chlamys. Take\ncare! he will make of the first Rue Grenetat which comes to hand Caudine\nForks. When the hour strikes, this man of the faubourgs will grow in\nstature; this little man will arise, and his gaze will be terrible, and\nhis breath will become a tempest, and there will issue forth from that\nslender chest enough wind to disarrange the folds of the Alps. It is,\nthanks to the suburban man of Paris, that the Revolution, mixed with\narms, conquers Europe. He sings; it is his delight. Proportion his song\nto his nature, and you will see! As long as he has for refrain nothing\nbut la Carmagnole, he only overthrows Louis XVI.; make him sing the\nMarseillaise, and he will free the world.\n\nThis note jotted down on the margin of Angles' report, we will return to\nour four couples. The dinner, as we have said, was drawing to its close.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI--A CHAPTER IN WHICH THEY ADORE EACH OTHER\n\nChat at table, the chat of love; it is as impossible to reproduce one as\nthe other; the chat of love is a cloud; the chat at table is smoke.\n\nFameuil and Dahlia were humming. Tholomyes was drinking. Zephine was\nlaughing, Fantine smiling, Listolier blowing a wooden trumpet which he\nhad purchased at Saint-Cloud.\n\nFavourite gazed tenderly at Blachevelle and said:--\n\n\"Blachevelle, I adore you.\"\n\nThis called forth a question from Blachevelle:--\n\n\"What would you do, Favourite, if I were to cease to love you?\"\n\n\"I!\" cried Favourite. \"Ah! Do not say that even in jest! If you were\nto cease to love me, I would spring after you, I would scratch you,\nI should rend you, I would throw you into the water, I would have you\narrested.\"\n\nBlachevelle smiled with the voluptuous self-conceit of a man who is\ntickled in his self-love. Favourite resumed:--\n\n\"Yes, I would scream to the police! Ah! I should not restrain myself,\nnot at all! Rabble!\"\n\nBlachevelle threw himself back in his chair, in an ecstasy, and closed\nboth eyes proudly.\n\nDahlia, as she ate, said in a low voice to Favourite, amid the uproar:--\n\n\"So you really idolize him deeply, that Blachevelle of yours?\"\n\n\"I? I detest him,\" replied Favourite in the same tone, seizing her fork\nagain. \"He is avaricious. I love the little fellow opposite me in my\nhouse. He is very nice, that young man; do you know him? One can see\nthat he is an actor by profession. I love actors. As soon as he comes\nin, his mother says to him: 'Ah! mon Dieu! my peace of mind is gone.\nThere he goes with his shouting. But, my dear, you are splitting my\nhead!' So he goes up to rat-ridden garrets, to black holes, as high as\nhe can mount, and there he sets to singing, declaiming, how do I know\nwhat? so that he can be heard down stairs! He earns twenty sous a day at\nan attorney's by penning quibbles. He is the son of a former precentor\nof Saint-Jacques-du-Haut-Pas. Ah! he is very nice. He idolizes me so,\nthat one day when he saw me making batter for some pancakes, he said to\nme: 'Mamselle, make your gloves into fritters, and I will eat them.' It\nis only artists who can say such things as that. Ah! he is very nice.\nI am in a fair way to go out of my head over that little fellow. Never\nmind; I tell Blachevelle that I adore him--how I lie! Hey! How I do\nlie!\"\n\nFavourite paused, and then went on:--\n\n\"I am sad, you see, Dahlia. It has done nothing but rain all summer; the\nwind irritates me; the wind does not abate. Blachevelle is very stingy;\nthere are hardly any green peas in the market; one does not know what to\neat. I have the spleen, as the English say, butter is so dear! and then\nyou see it is horrible, here we are dining in a room with a bed in it,\nand that disgusts me with life.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII--THE WISDOM OF THOLOMYES\n\nIn the meantime, while some sang, the rest talked together tumultuously\nall at once; it was no longer anything but noise. Tholomyes intervened.\n\n\"Let us not talk at random nor too fast,\" he exclaimed. \"Let us reflect,\nif we wish to be brilliant. Too much improvisation empties the mind in\na stupid way. Running beer gathers no froth. No haste, gentlemen. Let us\nmingle majesty with the feast. Let us eat with meditation; let us make\nhaste slowly. Let us not hurry. Consider the springtime; if it makes\nhaste, it is done for; that is to say, it gets frozen. Excess of zeal\nruins peach-trees and apricot-trees. Excess of zeal kills the grace and\nthe mirth of good dinners. No zeal, gentlemen! Grimod de la Reyniere\nagrees with Talleyrand.\"\n\nA hollow sound of rebellion rumbled through the group.\n\n\"Leave us in peace, Tholomyes,\" said Blachevelle.\n\n\"Down with the tyrant!\" said Fameuil.\n\n\"Bombarda, Bombance, and Bambochel!\" cried Listolier.\n\n\"Sunday exists,\" resumed Fameuil.\n\n\"We are sober,\" added Listolier.\n\n\"Tholomyes,\" remarked Blachevelle, \"contemplate my calmness [mon\ncalme].\"\n\n\"You are the Marquis of that,\" retorted Tholomyes.\n\nThis mediocre play upon words produced the effect of a stone in a pool.\nThe Marquis de Montcalm was at that time a celebrated royalist. All the\nfrogs held their peace.\n\n\"Friends,\" cried Tholomyes, with the accent of a man who had recovered\nhis empire, \"Come to yourselves. This pun which has fallen from the\nskies must not be received with too much stupor. Everything which falls\nin that way is not necessarily worthy of enthusiasm and respect. The pun\nis the dung of the mind which soars. The jest falls, no matter where;\nand the mind after producing a piece of stupidity plunges into the azure\ndepths. A whitish speck flattened against the rock does not prevent the\ncondor from soaring aloft. Far be it from me to insult the pun! I honor\nit in proportion to its merits; nothing more. All the most august, the\nmost sublime, the most charming of humanity, and perhaps outside of\nhumanity, have made puns. Jesus Christ made a pun on St. Peter, Moses on\nIsaac, AEschylus on Polynices, Cleopatra on Octavius. And observe that\nCleopatra's pun preceded the battle of Actium, and that had it not been\nfor it, no one would have remembered the city of Toryne, a Greek name\nwhich signifies a ladle. That once conceded, I return to my exhortation.\nI repeat, brothers, I repeat, no zeal, no hubbub, no excess; even in\nwitticisms, gayety, jollities, or plays on words. Listen to me. I have\nthe prudence of Amphiaraus and the baldness of Caesar. There must be a\nlimit, even to rebuses. Est modus in rebus.\n\n\"There must be a limit, even to dinners. You are fond of apple\nturnovers, ladies; do not indulge in them to excess. Even in the matter\nof turnovers, good sense and art are requisite. Gluttony chastises the\nglutton, Gula punit Gulax. Indigestion is charged by the good God with\npreaching morality to stomachs. And remember this: each one of our\npassions, even love, has a stomach which must not be filled too full. In\nall things the word finis must be written in good season; self-control\nmust be exercised when the matter becomes urgent; the bolt must be drawn\non appetite; one must set one's own fantasy to the violin, and carry\none's self to the post. The sage is the man who knows how, at a given\nmoment, to effect his own arrest. Have some confidence in me, for I\nhave succeeded to some extent in my study of the law, according to\nthe verdict of my examinations, for I know the difference between the\nquestion put and the question pending, for I have sustained a thesis in\nLatin upon the manner in which torture was administered at Rome at the\nepoch when Munatius Demens was quaestor of the Parricide; because I\nam going to be a doctor, apparently it does not follow that it is\nabsolutely necessary that I should be an imbecile. I recommend you to\nmoderation in your desires. It is true that my name is Felix Tholomyes;\nI speak well. Happy is he who, when the hour strikes, takes a heroic\nresolve, and abdicates like Sylla or Origenes.\"\n\nFavourite listened with profound attention.\n\n\"Felix,\" said she, \"what a pretty word! I love that name. It is Latin;\nit means prosper.\"\n\nTholomyes went on:--\n\n\"Quirites, gentlemen, caballeros, my friends. Do you wish never to feel\nthe prick, to do without the nuptial bed, and to brave love? Nothing\nmore simple. Here is the receipt: lemonade, excessive exercise, hard\nlabor; work yourself to death, drag blocks, sleep not, hold vigil,\ngorge yourself with nitrous beverages, and potions of nymphaeas; drink\nemulsions of poppies and agnus castus; season this with a strict diet,\nstarve yourself, and add thereto cold baths, girdles of herbs, the\napplication of a plate of lead, lotions made with the subacetate of\nlead, and fomentations of oxycrat.\"\n\n\"I prefer a woman,\" said Listolier.\n\n\"Woman,\" resumed Tholomyes; \"distrust her. Woe to him who yields himself\nto the unstable heart of woman! Woman is perfidious and disingenuous.\nShe detests the serpent from professional jealousy. The serpent is the\nshop over the way.\"\n\n\"Tholomyes!\" cried Blachevelle, \"you are drunk!\"\n\n\"Pardieu,\" said Tholomyes.\n\n\"Then be gay,\" resumed Blachevelle.\n\n\"I agree to that,\" responded Tholomyes.\n\nAnd, refilling his glass, he rose.\n\n\"Glory to wine! Nunc te, Bacche, canam! Pardon me ladies; that is\nSpanish. And the proof of it, senoras, is this: like people, like cask.\nThe arrobe of Castile contains sixteen litres; the cantaro of Alicante,\ntwelve; the almude of the Canaries, twenty-five; the cuartin of the\nBalearic Isles, twenty-six; the boot of Tzar Peter, thirty. Long\nlive that Tzar who was great, and long live his boot, which was still\ngreater! Ladies, take the advice of a friend; make a mistake in your\nneighbor if you see fit. The property of love is to err. A love\naffair is not made to crouch down and brutalize itself like an English\nserving-maid who has callouses on her knees from scrubbing. It is not\nmade for that; it errs gayly, our gentle love. It has been said, error\nis human; I say, error is love. Ladies, I idolize you all. O Zephine, O\nJosephine, face more than irregular, you would be charming were you not\nall askew. You have the air of a pretty face upon which some one has\nsat down by mistake. As for Favourite, O nymphs and muses! one day\nwhen Blachevelle was crossing the gutter in the Rue Guerin-Boisseau,\nhe espied a beautiful girl with white stockings well drawn up, which\ndisplayed her legs. This prologue pleased him, and Blachevelle fell\nin love. The one he loved was Favourite. O Favourite, thou hast Ionian\nlips. There was a Greek painter named Euphorion, who was surnamed the\npainter of the lips. That Greek alone would have been worthy to paint\nthy mouth. Listen! before thee, there was never a creature worthy of the\nname. Thou wert made to receive the apple like Venus, or to eat it like\nEve; beauty begins with thee. I have just referred to Eve; it is thou\nwho hast created her. Thou deservest the letters-patent of the beautiful\nwoman. O Favourite, I cease to address you as 'thou,' because I pass\nfrom poetry to prose. You were speaking of my name a little while ago.\nThat touched me; but let us, whoever we may be, distrust names. They may\ndelude us. I am called Felix, and I am not happy. Words are liars. Let\nus not blindly accept the indications which they afford us. It would be\na mistake to write to Liege [2] for corks, and to Pau for gloves. Miss\nDahlia, were I in your place, I would call myself Rosa. A flower should\nsmell sweet, and woman should have wit. I say nothing of Fantine; she\nis a dreamer, a musing, thoughtful, pensive person; she is a phantom\npossessed of the form of a nymph and the modesty of a nun, who has\nstrayed into the life of a grisette, but who takes refuge in illusions,\nand who sings and prays and gazes into the azure without very well\nknowing what she sees or what she is doing, and who, with her eyes fixed\non heaven, wanders in a garden where there are more birds than are in\nexistence. O Fantine, know this: I, Tholomyes, I am all illusion; but\nshe does not even hear me, that blond maid of Chimeras! as for the rest,\neverything about her is freshness, suavity, youth, sweet morning light.\nO Fantine, maid worthy of being called Marguerite or Pearl, you are a\nwoman from the beauteous Orient. Ladies, a second piece of advice: do\nnot marry; marriage is a graft; it takes well or ill; avoid that risk.\nBut bah! what am I saying? I am wasting my words. Girls are incurable\non the subject of marriage, and all that we wise men can say will not\nprevent the waistcoat-makers and the shoe-stitchers from dreaming\nof husbands studded with diamonds. Well, so be it; but, my beauties,\nremember this, you eat too much sugar. You have but one fault, O woman,\nand that is nibbling sugar. O nibbling sex, your pretty little white\nteeth adore sugar. Now, heed me well, sugar is a salt. All salts are\nwithering. Sugar is the most desiccating of all salts; it sucks the\nliquids of the blood through the veins; hence the coagulation, and then\nthe solidification of the blood; hence tubercles in the lungs, hence\ndeath. That is why diabetes borders on consumption. Then, do not crunch\nsugar, and you will live. I turn to the men: gentlemen, make conquest,\nrob each other of your well-beloved without remorse. Chassez across.\nIn love there are no friends. Everywhere where there is a pretty woman\nhostility is open. No quarter, war to the death! a pretty woman is a\ncasus belli; a pretty woman is flagrant misdemeanor. All the invasions\nof history have been determined by petticoats. Woman is man's right.\nRomulus carried off the Sabines; William carried off the Saxon women;\nCaesar carried off the Roman women. The man who is not loved soars like\na vulture over the mistresses of other men; and for my own part, to all\nthose unfortunate men who are widowers, I throw the sublime proclamation\nof Bonaparte to the army of Italy: \"Soldiers, you are in need of\neverything; the enemy has it.\"\n\nTholomyes paused.\n\n\"Take breath, Tholomyes,\" said Blachevelle.\n\nAt the same moment Blachevelle, supported by Listolier and Fameuil,\nstruck up to a plaintive air, one of those studio songs composed of\nthe first words which come to hand, rhymed richly and not at all, as\ndestitute of sense as the gesture of the tree and the sound of the wind,\nwhich have their birth in the vapor of pipes, and are dissipated and\ntake their flight with them. This is the couplet by which the group\nreplied to Tholomyes' harangue:--\n\n\n           \"The father turkey-cocks so grave\n            Some money to an agent gave,\n            That master good Clermont-Tonnerre\n            Might be made pope on Saint Johns' day fair.\n            But this good Clermont could not be\n            Made pope, because no priest was he;\n            And then their agent, whose wrath burned,\n            With all their money back returned.\"\n\n\nThis was not calculated to calm Tholomyes' improvisation; he emptied his\nglass, filled, refilled it, and began again:--\n\n\"Down with wisdom! Forget all that I have said. Let us be neither prudes\nnor prudent men nor prudhommes. I propose a toast to mirth; be merry.\nLet us complete our course of law by folly and eating! Indigestion and\nthe digest. Let Justinian be the male, and Feasting, the female! Joy in\nthe depths! Live, O creation! The world is a great diamond. I am happy.\nThe birds are astonishing. What a festival everywhere! The nightingale\nis a gratuitous Elleviou. Summer, I salute thee! O Luxembourg! O\nGeorgics of the Rue Madame, and of the Allee de l'Observatoire! O\npensive infantry soldiers! O all those charming nurses who, while they\nguard the children, amuse themselves! The pampas of America would please\nme if I had not the arcades of the Odeon. My soul flits away into the\nvirgin forests and to the savannas. All is beautiful. The flies buzz in\nthe sun. The sun has sneezed out the humming bird. Embrace me, Fantine!\"\n\nHe made a mistake and embraced Favourite.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII--THE DEATH OF A HORSE\n\n\n\"The dinners are better at Edon's than at Bombarda's,\" exclaimed\nZephine.\n\n\"I prefer Bombarda to Edon,\" declared Blachevelle. \"There is more\nluxury. It is more Asiatic. Look at the room downstairs; there are\nmirrors [glaces] on the walls.\"\n\n\"I prefer them [glaces, ices] on my plate,\" said Favourite.\n\nBlachevelle persisted:--\n\n\"Look at the knives. The handles are of silver at Bombarda's and of bone\nat Edon's. Now, silver is more valuable than bone.\"\n\n\"Except for those who have a silver chin,\" observed Tholomyes.\n\nHe was looking at the dome of the Invalides, which was visible from\nBombarda's windows.\n\nA pause ensued.\n\n\"Tholomyes,\" exclaimed Fameuil, \"Listolier and I were having a\ndiscussion just now.\"\n\n\"A discussion is a good thing,\" replied Tholomyes; \"a quarrel is\nbetter.\"\n\n\"We were disputing about philosophy.\"\n\n\"Well?\"\n\n\"Which do you prefer, Descartes or Spinoza?\"\n\n\"Desaugiers,\" said Tholomyes.\n\nThis decree pronounced, he took a drink, and went on:--\n\n\"I consent to live. All is not at an end on earth since we can still\ntalk nonsense. For that I return thanks to the immortal gods. We lie.\nOne lies, but one laughs. One affirms, but one doubts. The unexpected\nbursts forth from the syllogism. That is fine. There are still human\nbeings here below who know how to open and close the surprise box of the\nparadox merrily. This, ladies, which you are drinking with so tranquil\nan air is Madeira wine, you must know, from the vineyard of Coural das\nFreiras, which is three hundred and seventeen fathoms above the level of\nthe sea. Attention while you drink! three hundred and seventeen fathoms!\nand Monsieur Bombarda, the magnificent eating-house keeper, gives you\nthose three hundred and seventeen fathoms for four francs and fifty\ncentimes.\"\n\nAgain Fameuil interrupted him:--\n\n\"Tholomyes, your opinions fix the law. Who is your favorite author?\"\n\n\"Ber--\"\n\n\"Quin?\"\n\n\"No; Choux.\"\n\nAnd Tholomyes continued:--\n\n\"Honor to Bombarda! He would equal Munophis of Elephanta if he could but\nget me an Indian dancing-girl, and Thygelion of Chaeronea if he could\nbring me a Greek courtesan; for, oh, ladies! there were Bombardas in\nGreece and in Egypt. Apuleius tells us of them. Alas! always the same,\nand nothing new; nothing more unpublished by the creator in creation!\nNil sub sole novum, says Solomon; amor omnibus idem, says Virgil; and\nCarabine mounts with Carabin into the bark at Saint-Cloud, as Aspasia\nembarked with Pericles upon the fleet at Samos. One last word. Do you\nknow what Aspasia was, ladies? Although she lived at an epoch when women\nhad, as yet, no soul, she was a soul; a soul of a rosy and purple\nhue, more ardent hued than fire, fresher than the dawn. Aspasia was\na creature in whom two extremes of womanhood met; she was the goddess\nprostitute; Socrates plus Manon Lescaut. Aspasia was created in case a\nmistress should be needed for Prometheus.\"\n\nTholomyes, once started, would have found some difficulty in stopping,\nhad not a horse fallen down upon the quay just at that moment. The\nshock caused the cart and the orator to come to a dead halt. It was a\nBeauceron mare, old and thin, and one fit for the knacker, which was\ndragging a very heavy cart. On arriving in front of Bombarda's, the\nworn-out, exhausted beast had refused to proceed any further. This\nincident attracted a crowd. Hardly had the cursing and indignant carter\nhad time to utter with proper energy the sacramental word, Matin (the\njade), backed up with a pitiless cut of the whip, when the jade fell,\nnever to rise again. On hearing the hubbub made by the passersby,\nTholomyes' merry auditors turned their heads, and Tholomyes took\nadvantage of the opportunity to bring his allocution to a close with\nthis melancholy strophe:--\n\n      \"Elle etait de ce monde ou coucous et carrosses [3]\n          Ont le meme destin;\n      Et, rosse, elle a vecu ce que vivant les rosses,\n          L'espace d'un matin!\"\n\n\n\"Poor horse!\" sighed Fantine.\n\nAnd Dahlia exclaimed:--\n\n\"There is Fantine on the point of crying over horses. How can one be\nsuch a pitiful fool as that!\"\n\nAt that moment Favourite, folding her arms and throwing her head back,\nlooked resolutely at Tholomyes and said:--\n\n\"Come, now! the surprise?\"\n\n\"Exactly. The moment has arrived,\" replied Tholomyes. \"Gentlemen,\nthe hour for giving these ladies a surprise has struck. Wait for us a\nmoment, ladies.\"\n\n\"It begins with a kiss,\" said Blachevelle.\n\n\"On the brow,\" added Tholomyes.\n\nEach gravely bestowed a kiss on his mistress's brow; then all four filed\nout through the door, with their fingers on their lips.\n\nFavourite clapped her hands on their departure.\n\n\"It is beginning to be amusing already,\" said she.\n\n\"Don't be too long,\" murmured Fantine; \"we are waiting for you.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX--A MERRY END TO MIRTH\n\nWhen the young girls were left alone, they leaned two by two on the\nwindow-sills, chatting, craning out their heads, and talking from one\nwindow to the other.\n\nThey saw the young men emerge from the Cafe Bombarda arm in arm. The\nlatter turned round, made signs to them, smiled, and disappeared in\nthat dusty Sunday throng which makes a weekly invasion into the\nChamps-Elysees.\n\n\"Don't be long!\" cried Fantine.\n\n\"What are they going to bring us?\" said Zephine.\n\n\"It will certainly be something pretty,\" said Dahlia.\n\n\"For my part,\" said Favourite, \"I want it to be of gold.\"\n\nTheir attention was soon distracted by the movements on the shore of the\nlake, which they could see through the branches of the large trees, and\nwhich diverted them greatly.\n\nIt was the hour for the departure of the mail-coaches and diligences.\nNearly all the stage-coaches for the south and west passed through the\nChamps-Elysees. The majority followed the quay and went through the\nPassy Barrier. From moment to moment, some huge vehicle, painted yellow\nand black, heavily loaded, noisily harnessed, rendered shapeless\nby trunks, tarpaulins, and valises, full of heads which immediately\ndisappeared, rushed through the crowd with all the sparks of a forge,\nwith dust for smoke, and an air of fury, grinding the pavements,\nchanging all the paving-stones into steels. This uproar delighted the\nyoung girls. Favourite exclaimed:--\n\n\"What a row! One would say that it was a pile of chains flying away.\"\n\nIt chanced that one of these vehicles, which they could only see with\ndifficulty through the thick elms, halted for a moment, then set out\nagain at a gallop. This surprised Fantine.\n\n\"That's odd!\" said she. \"I thought the diligence never stopped.\"\n\nFavourite shrugged her shoulders.\n\n\"This Fantine is surprising. I am coming to take a look at her out of\ncuriosity. She is dazzled by the simplest things. Suppose a case: I am\na traveller; I say to the diligence, 'I will go on in advance; you shall\npick me up on the quay as you pass.' The diligence passes, sees me,\nhalts, and takes me. That is done every day. You do not know life, my\ndear.\"\n\nIn this manner a certain time elapsed. All at once Favourite made a\nmovement, like a person who is just waking up.\n\n\"Well,\" said she, \"and the surprise?\"\n\n\"Yes, by the way,\" joined in Dahlia, \"the famous surprise?\"\n\n\"They are a very long time about it!\" said Fantine.\n\nAs Fantine concluded this sigh, the waiter who had served them at dinner\nentered. He held in his hand something which resembled a letter.\n\n\"What is that?\" demanded Favourite.\n\nThe waiter replied:--\n\n\"It is a paper that those gentlemen left for these ladies.\"\n\n\"Why did you not bring it at once?\"\n\n\"Because,\" said the waiter, \"the gentlemen ordered me not to deliver it\nto the ladies for an hour.\"\n\nFavourite snatched the paper from the waiter's hand. It was, in fact, a\nletter.\n\n\"Stop!\" said she; \"there is no address; but this is what is written on\nit--\"\n\n                 \"THIS IS THE SURPRISE.\"\n\nShe tore the letter open hastily, opened it, and read [she knew how to\nread]:--\n\n\"OUR BELOVED:--\n\n\"You must know that we have parents. Parents--you do not know much about\nsuch things. They are called fathers and mothers by the civil code,\nwhich is puerile and honest. Now, these parents groan, these old folks\nimplore us, these good men and these good women call us prodigal sons;\nthey desire our return, and offer to kill calves for us. Being virtuous,\nwe obey them. At the hour when you read this, five fiery horses will\nbe bearing us to our papas and mammas. We are pulling up our stakes, as\nBossuet says. We are going; we are gone. We flee in the arms of Lafitte\nand on the wings of Caillard. The Toulouse diligence tears us from\nthe abyss, and the abyss is you, O our little beauties! We return to\nsociety, to duty, to respectability, at full trot, at the rate of three\nleagues an hour. It is necessary for the good of the country that we\nshould be, like the rest of the world, prefects, fathers of families,\nrural police, and councillors of state. Venerate us. We are sacrificing\nourselves. Mourn for us in haste, and replace us with speed. If this\nletter lacerates you, do the same by it. Adieu.\n\n\"For the space of nearly two years we have made you happy. We bear you\nno grudge for that.                                 \"Signed:\n                                            BLACHEVELLE.\n                                            FAMUEIL.\n                                            LISTOLIER.\n                                            FELIX THOLOMYES.\n\n\"Postscriptum. The dinner is paid for.\"\n\n\nThe four young women looked at each other.\n\nFavourite was the first to break the silence.\n\n\"Well!\" she exclaimed, \"it's a very pretty farce, all the same.\"\n\n\"It is very droll,\" said Zephine.\n\n\"That must have been Blachevelle's idea,\" resumed Favourite. \"It makes\nme in love with him. No sooner is he gone than he is loved. This is an\nadventure, indeed.\"\n\n\"No,\" said Dahlia; \"it was one of Tholomyes' ideas. That is evident.\n\n\"In that case,\" retorted Favourite, \"death to Blachevelle, and long live\nTholomyes!\"\n\n\"Long live Tholomyes!\" exclaimed Dahlia and Zephine.\n\nAnd they burst out laughing.\n\nFantine laughed with the rest.\n\nAn hour later, when she had returned to her room, she wept. It was\nher first love affair, as we have said; she had given herself to this\nTholomyes as to a husband, and the poor girl had a child.\n\n\n\n\nBOOK FOURTH.--TO CONFIDE IS SOMETIMES TO DELIVER INTO A PERSON'S POWER\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I--ONE MOTHER MEETS ANOTHER MOTHER\n\nThere was, at Montfermeil, near Paris, during the first quarter of this\ncentury, a sort of cook-shop which no longer exists. This cook-shop was\nkept by some people named Thenardier, husband and wife. It was situated\nin Boulanger Lane. Over the door there was a board nailed flat against\nthe wall. Upon this board was painted something which resembled a\nman carrying another man on his back, the latter wearing the big gilt\nepaulettes of a general, with large silver stars; red spots represented\nblood; the rest of the picture consisted of smoke, and probably\nrepresented a battle. Below ran this inscription: AT THE SIGN OF\nSERGEANT OF WATERLOO (Au Sargent de Waterloo).\n\nNothing is more common than a cart or a truck at the door of a hostelry.\nNevertheless, the vehicle, or, to speak more accurately, the fragment of\na vehicle, which encumbered the street in front of the cook-shop of the\nSergeant of Waterloo, one evening in the spring of 1818, would certainly\nhave attracted, by its mass, the attention of any painter who had passed\nthat way.\n\nIt was the fore-carriage of one of those trucks which are used in wooded\ntracts of country, and which serve to transport thick planks and the\ntrunks of trees. This fore-carriage was composed of a massive iron\naxle-tree with a pivot, into which was fitted a heavy shaft, and\nwhich was supported by two huge wheels. The whole thing was compact,\noverwhelming, and misshapen. It seemed like the gun-carriage of an\nenormous cannon. The ruts of the road had bestowed on the wheels, the\nfellies, the hub, the axle, and the shaft, a layer of mud, a hideous\nyellowish daubing hue, tolerably like that with which people are fond\nof ornamenting cathedrals. The wood was disappearing under mud, and the\niron beneath rust. Under the axle-tree hung, like drapery, a huge chain,\nworthy of some Goliath of a convict. This chain suggested, not the\nbeams, which it was its office to transport, but the mastodons and\nmammoths which it might have served to harness; it had the air of the\ngalleys, but of cyclopean and superhuman galleys, and it seemed to have\nbeen detached from some monster. Homer would have bound Polyphemus with\nit, and Shakespeare, Caliban.\n\nWhy was that fore-carriage of a truck in that place in the street? In\nthe first place, to encumber the street; next, in order that it might\nfinish the process of rusting. There is a throng of institutions in the\nold social order, which one comes across in this fashion as one walks\nabout outdoors, and which have no other reasons for existence than the\nabove.\n\nThe centre of the chain swung very near the ground in the middle, and in\nthe loop, as in the rope of a swing, there were seated and grouped, on\nthat particular evening, in exquisite interlacement, two little girls;\none about two years and a half old, the other, eighteen months; the\nyounger in the arms of the other. A handkerchief, cleverly knotted about\nthem, prevented their falling out. A mother had caught sight of that\nfrightful chain, and had said, \"Come! there's a plaything for my\nchildren.\"\n\nThe two children, who were dressed prettily and with some elegance, were\nradiant with pleasure; one would have said that they were two roses amid\nold iron; their eyes were a triumph; their fresh cheeks were full of\nlaughter. One had chestnut hair; the other, brown. Their innocent faces\nwere two delighted surprises; a blossoming shrub which grew near wafted\nto the passers-by perfumes which seemed to emanate from them; the child\nof eighteen months displayed her pretty little bare stomach with the\nchaste indecency of childhood. Above and around these two delicate\nheads, all made of happiness and steeped in light, the gigantic\nfore-carriage, black with rust, almost terrible, all entangled in curves\nand wild angles, rose in a vault, like the entrance of a cavern. A few\npaces apart, crouching down upon the threshold of the hostelry, the\nmother, not a very prepossessing woman, by the way, though touching\nat that moment, was swinging the two children by means of a long cord,\nwatching them carefully, for fear of accidents, with that animal and\ncelestial expression which is peculiar to maternity. At every backward\nand forward swing the hideous links emitted a strident sound, which\nresembled a cry of rage; the little girls were in ecstasies; the setting\nsun mingled in this joy, and nothing could be more charming than this\ncaprice of chance which had made of a chain of Titans the swing of\ncherubim.\n\nAs she rocked her little ones, the mother hummed in a discordant voice a\nromance then celebrated:--\n\n\n                 \"It must be, said a warrior.\"\n\n\nHer song, and the contemplation of her daughters, prevented her hearing\nand seeing what was going on in the street.\n\nIn the meantime, some one had approached her, as she was beginning the\nfirst couplet of the romance, and suddenly she heard a voice saying very\nnear her ear:--\n\n\"You have two beautiful children there, Madame.\"\n\n\n                 \"To the fair and tender Imogene--\"\n\n\nreplied the mother, continuing her romance; then she turned her head.\n\nA woman stood before her, a few paces distant. This woman also had a\nchild, which she carried in her arms.\n\nShe was carrying, in addition, a large carpet-bag, which seemed very\nheavy.\n\nThis woman's child was one of the most divine creatures that it is\npossible to behold. It was a girl, two or three years of age. She could\nhave entered into competition with the two other little ones, so far as\nthe coquetry of her dress was concerned; she wore a cap of fine linen,\nribbons on her bodice, and Valenciennes lace on her cap. The folds of\nher skirt were raised so as to permit a view of her white, firm, and\ndimpled leg. She was admirably rosy and healthy. The little beauty\ninspired a desire to take a bite from the apples of her cheeks. Of her\neyes nothing could be known, except that they must be very large, and\nthat they had magnificent lashes. She was asleep.\n\nShe slept with that slumber of absolute confidence peculiar to her\nage. The arms of mothers are made of tenderness; in them children sleep\nprofoundly.\n\nAs for the mother, her appearance was sad and poverty-stricken. She\nwas dressed like a working-woman who is inclined to turn into a peasant\nagain. She was young. Was she handsome? Perhaps; but in that attire it\nwas not apparent. Her hair, a golden lock of which had escaped, seemed\nvery thick, but was severely concealed beneath an ugly, tight, close,\nnun-like cap, tied under the chin. A smile displays beautiful teeth when\none has them; but she did not smile. Her eyes did not seem to have been\ndry for a very long time. She was pale; she had a very weary and rather\nsickly appearance. She gazed upon her daughter asleep in her arms with\nthe air peculiar to a mother who has nursed her own child. A large blue\nhandkerchief, such as the Invalides use, was folded into a fichu, and\nconcealed her figure clumsily. Her hands were sunburnt and all dotted\nwith freckles, her forefinger was hardened and lacerated with the\nneedle; she wore a cloak of coarse brown woollen stuff, a linen gown,\nand coarse shoes. It was Fantine.\n\nIt was Fantine, but difficult to recognize. Nevertheless, on\nscrutinizing her attentively, it was evident that she still retained\nher beauty. A melancholy fold, which resembled the beginning of irony,\nwrinkled her right cheek. As for her toilette, that aerial toilette of\nmuslin and ribbons, which seemed made of mirth, of folly, and of music,\nfull of bells, and perfumed with lilacs had vanished like that beautiful\nand dazzling hoar-frost which is mistaken for diamonds in the sunlight;\nit melts and leaves the branch quite black.\n\nTen months had elapsed since the \"pretty farce.\"\n\nWhat had taken place during those ten months? It can be divined.\n\nAfter abandonment, straightened circumstances. Fantine had immediately\nlost sight of Favourite, Zephine and Dahlia; the bond once broken on the\nside of the men, it was loosed between the women; they would have been\ngreatly astonished had any one told them a fortnight later, that they\nhad been friends; there no longer existed any reason for such a thing.\nFantine had remained alone. The father of her child gone,--alas! such\nruptures are irrevocable,--she found herself absolutely isolated, minus\nthe habit of work and plus the taste for pleasure. Drawn away by her\nliaison with Tholomyes to disdain the pretty trade which she knew, she\nhad neglected to keep her market open; it was now closed to her. She had\nno resource. Fantine barely knew how to read, and did not know how to\nwrite; in her childhood she had only been taught to sign her name;\nshe had a public letter-writer indite an epistle to Tholomyes, then a\nsecond, then a third. Tholomyes replied to none of them. Fantine heard\nthe gossips say, as they looked at her child: \"Who takes those children\nseriously! One only shrugs one's shoulders over such children!\" Then she\nthought of Tholomyes, who had shrugged his shoulders over his child,\nand who did not take that innocent being seriously; and her heart grew\ngloomy toward that man. But what was she to do? She no longer knew to\nwhom to apply. She had committed a fault, but the foundation of her\nnature, as will be remembered, was modesty and virtue. She was vaguely\nconscious that she was on the verge of falling into distress, and of\ngliding into a worse state. Courage was necessary; she possessed it, and\nheld herself firm. The idea of returning to her native town of M. sur\nM. occurred to her. There, some one might possibly know her and give her\nwork; yes, but it would be necessary to conceal her fault. In a confused\nway she perceived the necessity of a separation which would be more\npainful than the first one. Her heart contracted, but she took her\nresolution. Fantine, as we shall see, had the fierce bravery of life.\nShe had already valiantly renounced finery, had dressed herself in\nlinen, and had put all her silks, all her ornaments, all her ribbons,\nand all her laces on her daughter, the only vanity which was left to\nher, and a holy one it was. She sold all that she had, which produced\nfor her two hundred francs; her little debts paid, she had only about\neighty francs left. At the age of twenty-two, on a beautiful spring\nmorning, she quitted Paris, bearing her child on her back. Any one who\nhad seen these two pass would have had pity on them. This woman had,\nin all the world, nothing but her child, and the child had, in all the\nworld, no one but this woman. Fantine had nursed her child, and this had\ntired her chest, and she coughed a little.\n\nWe shall have no further occasion to speak of M. Felix Tholomyes. Let us\nconfine ourselves to saying, that, twenty years later, under King Louis\nPhilippe, he was a great provincial lawyer, wealthy and influential, a\nwise elector, and a very severe juryman; he was still a man of pleasure.\n\nTowards the middle of the day, after having, from time to time, for the\nsake of resting herself, travelled, for three or four sous a league, in\nwhat was then known as the Petites Voitures des Environs de Paris, the\n\"little suburban coach service,\" Fantine found herself at Montfermeil,\nin the alley Boulanger.\n\nAs she passed the Thenardier hostelry, the two little girls, blissful\nin the monster swing, had dazzled her in a manner, and she had halted in\nfront of that vision of joy.\n\nCharms exist. These two little girls were a charm to this mother.\n\nShe gazed at them in much emotion. The presence of angels is an\nannouncement of Paradise. She thought that, above this inn, she beheld\nthe mysterious HERE of Providence. These two little creatures were\nevidently happy. She gazed at them, she admired them, in such emotion\nthat at the moment when their mother was recovering her breath between\ntwo couplets of her song, she could not refrain from addressing to her\nthe remark which we have just read:--\n\n\"You have two pretty children, Madame.\"\n\nThe most ferocious creatures are disarmed by caresses bestowed on their\nyoung.\n\nThe mother raised her head and thanked her, and bade the wayfarer\nsit down on the bench at the door, she herself being seated on the\nthreshold. The two women began to chat.\n\n\"My name is Madame Thenardier,\" said the mother of the two little girls.\n\"We keep this inn.\"\n\nThen, her mind still running on her romance, she resumed humming between\nher teeth:--\n\n                 \"It must be so; I am a knight,\n                  And I am off to Palestine.\"\n\n\nThis Madame Thenardier was a sandy-complexioned woman, thin and\nangular--the type of the soldier's wife in all its unpleasantness; and\nwhat was odd, with a languishing air, which she owed to her perusal\nof romances. She was a simpering, but masculine creature. Old romances\nproduce that effect when rubbed against the imagination of cook-shop\nwoman. She was still young; she was barely thirty. If this crouching\nwoman had stood upright, her lofty stature and her frame of a\nperambulating colossus suitable for fairs, might have frightened the\ntraveller at the outset, troubled her confidence, and disturbed what\ncaused what we have to relate to vanish. A person who is seated instead\nof standing erect--destinies hang upon such a thing as that.\n\nThe traveller told her story, with slight modifications.\n\nThat she was a working-woman; that her husband was dead; that her\nwork in Paris had failed her, and that she was on her way to seek it\nelsewhere, in her own native parts; that she had left Paris that morning\non foot; that, as she was carrying her child, and felt fatigued, she had\ngot into the Villemomble coach when she met it; that from Villemomble\nshe had come to Montfermeil on foot; that the little one had walked a\nlittle, but not much, because she was so young, and that she had been\nobliged to take her up, and the jewel had fallen asleep.\n\nAt this word she bestowed on her daughter a passionate kiss, which woke\nher. The child opened her eyes, great blue eyes like her mother's, and\nlooked at--what? Nothing; with that serious and sometimes severe air of\nlittle children, which is a mystery of their luminous innocence in\nthe presence of our twilight of virtue. One would say that they feel\nthemselves to be angels, and that they know us to be men. Then the child\nbegan to laugh; and although the mother held fast to her, she slipped to\nthe ground with the unconquerable energy of a little being which wished\nto run. All at once she caught sight of the two others in the swing,\nstopped short, and put out her tongue, in sign of admiration.\n\nMother Thenardier released her daughters, made them descend from the\nswing, and said:--\n\n\"Now amuse yourselves, all three of you.\"\n\nChildren become acquainted quickly at that age, and at the expiration\nof a minute the little Thenardiers were playing with the new-comer at\nmaking holes in the ground, which was an immense pleasure.\n\nThe new-comer was very gay; the goodness of the mother is written in the\ngayety of the child; she had seized a scrap of wood which served her\nfor a shovel, and energetically dug a cavity big enough for a fly. The\ngrave-digger's business becomes a subject for laughter when performed by\na child.\n\nThe two women pursued their chat.\n\n\"What is your little one's name?\"\n\n\"Cosette.\"\n\nFor Cosette, read Euphrasie. The child's name was Euphrasie. But out\nof Euphrasie the mother had made Cosette by that sweet and graceful\ninstinct of mothers and of the populace which changes Josepha into\nPepita, and Francoise into Sillette. It is a sort of derivative which\ndisarranges and disconcerts the whole science of etymologists. We have\nknown a grandmother who succeeded in turning Theodore into Gnon.\n\n\"How old is she?\"\n\n\"She is going on three.\"\n\n\"That is the age of my eldest.\"\n\nIn the meantime, the three little girls were grouped in an attitude of\nprofound anxiety and blissfulness; an event had happened; a big worm\nhad emerged from the ground, and they were afraid; and they were in\necstasies over it.\n\nTheir radiant brows touched each other; one would have said that there\nwere three heads in one aureole.\n\n\"How easily children get acquainted at once!\" exclaimed Mother\nThenardier; \"one would swear that they were three sisters!\"\n\nThis remark was probably the spark which the other mother had been\nwaiting for. She seized the Thenardier's hand, looked at her fixedly,\nand said:--\n\n\"Will you keep my child for me?\"\n\nThe Thenardier made one of those movements of surprise which signify\nneither assent nor refusal.\n\nCosette's mother continued:--\n\n\"You see, I cannot take my daughter to the country. My work will not\npermit it. With a child one can find no situation. People are ridiculous\nin the country. It was the good God who caused me to pass your inn. When\nI caught sight of your little ones, so pretty, so clean, and so happy,\nit overwhelmed me. I said: 'Here is a good mother. That is just the\nthing; that will make three sisters.' And then, it will not be long\nbefore I return. Will you keep my child for me?\"\n\n\"I must see about it,\" replied the Thenardier.\n\n\"I will give you six francs a month.\"\n\nHere a man's voice called from the depths of the cook-shop:--\n\n\"Not for less than seven francs. And six months paid in advance.\"\n\n\"Six times seven makes forty-two,\" said the Thenardier.\n\n\"I will give it,\" said the mother.\n\n\"And fifteen francs in addition for preliminary expenses,\" added the\nman's voice.\n\n\"Total, fifty-seven francs,\" said Madame Thenardier. And she hummed\nvaguely, with these figures:--\n\n                 \"It must be, said a warrior.\"\n\n\n\"I will pay it,\" said the mother. \"I have eighty francs. I shall have\nenough left to reach the country, by travelling on foot. I shall\nearn money there, and as soon as I have a little I will return for my\ndarling.\"\n\nThe man's voice resumed:--\n\n\"The little one has an outfit?\"\n\n\"That is my husband,\" said the Thenardier.\n\n\"Of course she has an outfit, the poor treasure.--I understood perfectly\nthat it was your husband.--And a beautiful outfit, too! a senseless\noutfit, everything by the dozen, and silk gowns like a lady. It is here,\nin my carpet-bag.\"\n\n\"You must hand it over,\" struck in the man's voice again.\n\n\"Of course I shall give it to you,\" said the mother. \"It would be very\nqueer if I were to leave my daughter quite naked!\"\n\nThe master's face appeared.\n\n\"That's good,\" said he.\n\nThe bargain was concluded. The mother passed the night at the inn, gave\nup her money and left her child, fastened her carpet-bag once more, now\nreduced in volume by the removal of the outfit, and light henceforth\nand set out on the following morning, intending to return soon. People\narrange such departures tranquilly; but they are despairs!\n\nA neighbor of the Thenardiers met this mother as she was setting out,\nand came back with the remark:--\n\n\"I have just seen a woman crying in the street so that it was enough to\nrend your heart.\"\n\nWhen Cosette's mother had taken her departure, the man said to the\nwoman:--\n\n\"That will serve to pay my note for one hundred and ten francs which\nfalls due to-morrow; I lacked fifty francs. Do you know that I should\nhave had a bailiff and a protest after me? You played the mouse-trap\nnicely with your young ones.\"\n\n\"Without suspecting it,\" said the woman.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II--FIRST SKETCH OF TWO UNPREPOSSESSING FIGURES\n\nThe mouse which had been caught was a pitiful specimen; but the cat\nrejoices even over a lean mouse.\n\nWho were these Thenardiers?\n\nLet us say a word or two of them now. We will complete the sketch later\non.\n\nThese beings belonged to that bastard class composed of coarse people\nwho have been successful, and of intelligent people who have descended\nin the scale, which is between the class called \"middle\" and the class\ndenominated as \"inferior,\" and which combines some of the defects of the\nsecond with nearly all the vices of the first, without possessing\nthe generous impulse of the workingman nor the honest order of the\nbourgeois.\n\nThey were of those dwarfed natures which, if a dull fire chances to warm\nthem up, easily become monstrous. There was in the woman a substratum\nof the brute, and in the man the material for a blackguard. Both were\nsusceptible, in the highest degree, of the sort of hideous progress\nwhich is accomplished in the direction of evil. There exist crab-like\nsouls which are continually retreating towards the darkness,\nretrograding in life rather than advancing, employing experience to\naugment their deformity, growing incessantly worse, and becoming more\nand more impregnated with an ever-augmenting blackness. This man and\nwoman possessed such souls.\n\nThenardier, in particular, was troublesome for a physiognomist. One can\nonly look at some men to distrust them; for one feels that they are\ndark in both directions. They are uneasy in the rear and threatening\nin front. There is something of the unknown about them. One can no more\nanswer for what they have done than for what they will do. The shadow\nwhich they bear in their glance denounces them. From merely hearing them\nutter a word or seeing them make a gesture, one obtains a glimpse of\nsombre secrets in their past and of sombre mysteries in their future.\n\nThis Thenardier, if he himself was to be believed, had been a soldier--a\nsergeant, he said. He had probably been through the campaign of 1815,\nand had even conducted himself with tolerable valor, it would seem. We\nshall see later on how much truth there was in this. The sign of his\nhostelry was in allusion to one of his feats of arms. He had painted it\nhimself; for he knew how to do a little of everything, and badly.\n\nIt was at the epoch when the ancient classical romance which, after\nhaving been Clelie, was no longer anything but Lodoiska, still noble,\nbut ever more and more vulgar, having fallen from Mademoiselle de\nScuderi to Madame Bournon-Malarme, and from Madame de Lafayette to\nMadame Barthelemy-Hadot, was setting the loving hearts of the portresses\nof Paris aflame, and even ravaging the suburbs to some extent. Madame\nThenardier was just intelligent enough to read this sort of books. She\nlived on them. In them she drowned what brains she possessed. This had\ngiven her, when very young, and even a little later, a sort of pensive\nattitude towards her husband, a scamp of a certain depth, a ruffian\nlettered to the extent of the grammar, coarse and fine at one and the\nsame time, but, so far as sentimentalism was concerned, given to the\nperusal of Pigault-Lebrun, and \"in what concerns the sex,\" as he said\nin his jargon--a downright, unmitigated lout. His wife was twelve or\nfifteen years younger than he was. Later on, when her hair, arranged in\na romantically drooping fashion, began to grow gray, when the Magaera\nbegan to be developed from the Pamela, the female Thenardier was nothing\nbut a coarse, vicious woman, who had dabbled in stupid romances. Now,\none cannot read nonsense with impunity. The result was that her eldest\ndaughter was named Eponine; as for the younger, the poor little thing\ncame near being called Gulnare; I know not to what diversion, effected\nby a romance of Ducray-Dumenil, she owed the fact that she merely bore\nthe name of Azelma.\n\nHowever, we will remark by the way, everything was not ridiculous and\nsuperficial in that curious epoch to which we are alluding, and which\nmay be designated as the anarchy of baptismal names. By the side of\nthis romantic element which we have just indicated there is the social\nsymptom. It is not rare for the neatherd's boy nowadays to bear the name\nof Arthur, Alfred, or Alphonse, and for the vicomte--if there are\nstill any vicomtes--to be called Thomas, Pierre, or Jacques. This\ndisplacement, which places the \"elegant\" name on the plebeian and the\nrustic name on the aristocrat, is nothing else than an eddy of equality.\nThe irresistible penetration of the new inspiration is there as\neverywhere else. Beneath this apparent discord there is a great and a\nprofound thing,--the French Revolution.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III--THE LARK\n\nIt is not all in all sufficient to be wicked in order to prosper. The\ncook-shop was in a bad way.\n\nThanks to the traveller's fifty-seven francs, Thenardier had been able\nto avoid a protest and to honor his signature. On the following month\nthey were again in need of money. The woman took Cosette's outfit to\nParis, and pawned it at the pawnbroker's for sixty francs. As soon\nas that sum was spent, the Thenardiers grew accustomed to look on the\nlittle girl merely as a child whom they were caring for out of charity;\nand they treated her accordingly. As she had no longer any clothes, they\ndressed her in the cast-off petticoats and chemises of the Thenardier\nbrats; that is to say, in rags. They fed her on what all the rest\nhad left--a little better than the dog, a little worse than the cat.\nMoreover, the cat and the dog were her habitual table-companions;\nCosette ate with them under the table, from a wooden bowl similar to\ntheirs.\n\nThe mother, who had established herself, as we shall see later on, at M.\nsur M., wrote, or, more correctly, caused to be written, a letter every\nmonth, that she might have news of her child. The Thenardiers replied\ninvariably, \"Cosette is doing wonderfully well.\"\n\nAt the expiration of the first six months the mother sent seven francs\nfor the seventh month, and continued her remittances with tolerable\nregularity from month to month. The year was not completed when\nThenardier said: \"A fine favor she is doing us, in sooth! What does she\nexpect us to do with her seven francs?\" and he wrote to demand twelve\nfrancs. The mother, whom they had persuaded into the belief that her\nchild was happy, \"and was coming on well,\" submitted, and forwarded the\ntwelve francs.\n\nCertain natures cannot love on the one hand without hating on the other.\nMother Thenardier loved her two daughters passionately, which caused her\nto hate the stranger.\n\nIt is sad to think that the love of a mother can possess villainous\naspects. Little as was the space occupied by Cosette, it seemed to\nher as though it were taken from her own, and that that little child\ndiminished the air which her daughters breathed. This woman, like many\nwomen of her sort, had a load of caresses and a burden of blows and\ninjuries to dispense each day. If she had not had Cosette, it is certain\nthat her daughters, idolized as they were, would have received the whole\nof it; but the stranger did them the service to divert the blows to\nherself. Her daughters received nothing but caresses. Cosette could not\nmake a motion which did not draw down upon her head a heavy shower of\nviolent blows and unmerited chastisement. The sweet, feeble being, who\nshould not have understood anything of this world or of God, incessantly\npunished, scolded, ill-used, beaten, and seeing beside her two little\ncreatures like herself, who lived in a ray of dawn!\n\nMadame Thenardier was vicious with Cosette. Eponine and Azelma were\nvicious. Children at that age are only copies of their mother. The size\nis smaller; that is all.\n\nA year passed; then another.\n\nPeople in the village said:--\n\n\"Those Thenardiers are good people. They are not rich, and yet they are\nbringing up a poor child who was abandoned on their hands!\"\n\nThey thought that Cosette's mother had forgotten her.\n\nIn the meanwhile, Thenardier, having learned, it is impossible to say by\nwhat obscure means, that the child was probably a bastard, and that the\nmother could not acknowledge it, exacted fifteen francs a month, saying\nthat \"the creature\" was growing and \"eating,\" and threatening to send\nher away. \"Let her not bother me,\" he exclaimed, \"or I'll fire her brat\nright into the middle of her secrets. I must have an increase.\" The\nmother paid the fifteen francs.\n\nFrom year to year the child grew, and so did her wretchedness.\n\nAs long as Cosette was little, she was the scape-goat of the two other\nchildren; as soon as she began to develop a little, that is to say,\nbefore she was even five years old, she became the servant of the\nhousehold.\n\nFive years old! the reader will say; that is not probable. Alas! it is\ntrue. Social suffering begins at all ages. Have we not recently seen the\ntrial of a man named Dumollard, an orphan turned bandit, who, from the\nage of five, as the official documents state, being alone in the world,\n\"worked for his living and stole\"?\n\nCosette was made to run on errands, to sweep the rooms, the courtyard,\nthe street, to wash the dishes, to even carry burdens. The Thenardiers\nconsidered themselves all the more authorized to behave in this manner,\nsince the mother, who was still at M. sur M., had become irregular in\nher payments. Some months she was in arrears.\n\nIf this mother had returned to Montfermeil at the end of these three\nyears, she would not have recognized her child. Cosette, so pretty and\nrosy on her arrival in that house, was now thin and pale. She had an\nindescribably uneasy look. \"The sly creature,\" said the Thenardiers.\n\nInjustice had made her peevish, and misery had made her ugly. Nothing\nremained to her except her beautiful eyes, which inspired pain, because,\nlarge as they were, it seemed as though one beheld in them a still\nlarger amount of sadness.\n\nIt was a heart-breaking thing to see this poor child, not yet six years\nold, shivering in the winter in her old rags of linen, full of holes,\nsweeping the street before daylight, with an enormous broom in her tiny\nred hands, and a tear in her great eyes.\n\n[Illustration: Cossette Sweeping  1b4-1-cossette-sweeping]\n\nShe was called the Lark in the neighborhood. The populace, who are fond\nof these figures of speech, had taken a fancy to bestow this name on\nthis trembling, frightened, and shivering little creature, no bigger\nthan a bird, who was awake every morning before any one else in the\nhouse or the village, and was always in the street or the fields before\ndaybreak.\n\nOnly the little lark never sang.\n\n\n\n\nBOOK FIFTH.--THE DESCENT.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I--THE HISTORY OF A PROGRESS IN BLACK GLASS TRINKETS\n\nAnd in the meantime, what had become of that mother who according to\nthe people at Montfermeil, seemed to have abandoned her child? Where was\nshe? What was she doing?\n\nAfter leaving her little Cosette with the Thenardiers, she had continued\nher journey, and had reached M. sur M.\n\nThis, it will be remembered, was in 1818.\n\nFantine had quitted her province ten years before. M. sur M. had changed\nits aspect. While Fantine had been slowly descending from wretchedness\nto wretchedness, her native town had prospered.\n\nAbout two years previously one of those industrial facts which are the\ngrand events of small districts had taken place.\n\nThis detail is important, and we regard it as useful to develop it at\nlength; we should almost say, to underline it.\n\nFrom time immemorial, M. sur M. had had for its special industry the\nimitation of English jet and the black glass trinkets of Germany. This\nindustry had always vegetated, on account of the high price of the raw\nmaterial, which reacted on the manufacture. At the moment when Fantine\nreturned to M. sur M., an unheard-of transformation had taken place\nin the production of \"black goods.\" Towards the close of 1815 a man,\na stranger, had established himself in the town, and had been inspired\nwith the idea of substituting, in this manufacture, gum-lac for resin,\nand, for bracelets in particular, slides of sheet-iron simply laid\ntogether, for slides of soldered sheet-iron.\n\nThis very small change had effected a revolution.\n\nThis very small change had, in fact, prodigiously reduced the cost of\nthe raw material, which had rendered it possible in the first place, to\nraise the price of manufacture, a benefit to the country; in the second\nplace, to improve the workmanship, an advantage to the consumer; in the\nthird place, to sell at a lower price, while trebling the profit, which\nwas a benefit to the manufacturer.\n\nThus three results ensued from one idea.\n\nIn less than three years the inventor of this process had become rich,\nwhich is good, and had made every one about him rich, which is better.\nHe was a stranger in the Department. Of his origin, nothing was known;\nof the beginning of his career, very little. It was rumored that he had\ncome to town with very little money, a few hundred francs at the most.\n\nIt was from this slender capital, enlisted in the service of an\ningenious idea, developed by method and thought, that he had drawn his\nown fortune, and the fortune of the whole countryside.\n\nOn his arrival at M. sur M. he had only the garments, the appearance,\nand the language of a workingman.\n\nIt appears that on the very day when he made his obscure entry into\nthe little town of M. sur M., just at nightfall, on a December evening,\nknapsack on back and thorn club in hand, a large fire had broken out\nin the town-hall. This man had rushed into the flames and saved, at the\nrisk of his own life, two children who belonged to the captain of the\ngendarmerie; this is why they had forgotten to ask him for his passport.\nAfterwards they had learned his name. He was called Father Madeleine.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II--MADELEINE\n\nHe was a man about fifty years of age, who had a preoccupied air, and\nwho was good. That was all that could be said about him.\n\nThanks to the rapid progress of the industry which he had so admirably\nre-constructed, M. sur M. had become a rather important centre of trade.\nSpain, which consumes a good deal of black jet, made enormous purchases\nthere each year. M. sur M. almost rivalled London and Berlin in this\nbranch of commerce. Father Madeleine's profits were such, that at the\nend of the second year he was able to erect a large factory, in which\nthere were two vast workrooms, one for the men, and the other for women.\nAny one who was hungry could present himself there, and was sure of\nfinding employment and bread. Father Madeleine required of the men good\nwill, of the women pure morals, and of all, probity. He had separated\nthe work-rooms in order to separate the sexes, and so that the women and\ngirls might remain discreet. On this point he was inflexible. It was the\nonly thing in which he was in a manner intolerant. He was all the more\nfirmly set on this severity, since M. sur M., being a garrison town,\nopportunities for corruption abounded. However, his coming had been a\nboon, and his presence was a godsend. Before Father Madeleine's arrival,\neverything had languished in the country; now everything lived with\na healthy life of toil. A strong circulation warmed everything and\npenetrated everywhere. Slack seasons and wretchedness were unknown.\nThere was no pocket so obscure that it had not a little money in it; no\ndwelling so lowly that there was not some little joy within it.\n\nFather Madeleine gave employment to every one. He exacted but one thing:\nBe an honest man. Be an honest woman.\n\nAs we have said, in the midst of this activity of which he was the cause\nand the pivot, Father Madeleine made his fortune; but a singular thing\nin a simple man of business, it did not seem as though that were his\nchief care. He appeared to be thinking much of others, and little of\nhimself. In 1820 he was known to have a sum of six hundred and thirty\nthousand francs lodged in his name with Laffitte; but before reserving\nthese six hundred and thirty thousand francs, he had spent more than a\nmillion for the town and its poor.\n\nThe hospital was badly endowed; he founded six beds there. M. sur M. is\ndivided into the upper and the lower town. The lower town, in which he\nlived, had but one school, a miserable hovel, which was falling to ruin:\nhe constructed two, one for girls, the other for boys. He allotted a\nsalary from his own funds to the two instructors, a salary twice as\nlarge as their meagre official salary, and one day he said to some one\nwho expressed surprise, \"The two prime functionaries of the state are\nthe nurse and the schoolmaster.\" He created at his own expense an infant\nschool, a thing then almost unknown in France, and a fund for aiding old\nand infirm workmen. As his factory was a centre, a new quarter, in which\nthere were a good many indigent families, rose rapidly around him; he\nestablished there a free dispensary.\n\nAt first, when they watched his beginnings, the good souls said, \"He's\na jolly fellow who means to get rich.\" When they saw him enriching\nthe country before he enriched himself, the good souls said, \"He is\nan ambitious man.\" This seemed all the more probable since the man was\nreligious, and even practised his religion to a certain degree, a thing\nwhich was very favorably viewed at that epoch. He went regularly to\nlow mass every Sunday. The local deputy, who nosed out all rivalry\neverywhere, soon began to grow uneasy over this religion. This deputy\nhad been a member of the legislative body of the Empire, and shared the\nreligious ideas of a father of the Oratoire, known under the name\nof Fouche, Duc d'Otrante, whose creature and friend he had been. He\nindulged in gentle raillery at God with closed doors. But when he beheld\nthe wealthy manufacturer Madeleine going to low mass at seven o'clock,\nhe perceived in him a possible candidate, and resolved to outdo him; he\ntook a Jesuit confessor, and went to high mass and to vespers. Ambition\nwas at that time, in the direct acceptation of the word, a race to the\nsteeple. The poor profited by this terror as well as the good God, for\nthe honorable deputy also founded two beds in the hospital, which made\ntwelve.\n\nNevertheless, in 1819 a rumor one morning circulated through the town\nto the effect that, on the representations of the prefect and in\nconsideration of the services rendered by him to the country, Father\nMadeleine was to be appointed by the King, mayor of M. sur M. Those who\nhad pronounced this new-comer to be \"an ambitious fellow,\" seized with\ndelight on this opportunity which all men desire, to exclaim, \"There!\nwhat did we say!\" All M. sur M. was in an uproar. The rumor was well\nfounded. Several days later the appointment appeared in the Moniteur. On\nthe following day Father Madeleine refused.\n\nIn this same year of 1819 the products of the new process invented by\nMadeleine figured in the industrial exhibition; when the jury made their\nreport, the King appointed the inventor a chevalier of the Legion of\nHonor. A fresh excitement in the little town. Well, so it was the cross\nthat he wanted! Father Madeleine refused the cross.\n\nDecidedly this man was an enigma. The good souls got out of their\npredicament by saying, \"After all, he is some sort of an adventurer.\"\n\nWe have seen that the country owed much to him; the poor owed him\neverything; he was so useful and he was so gentle that people had been\nobliged to honor and respect him. His workmen, in particular, adored\nhim, and he endured this adoration with a sort of melancholy gravity.\nWhen he was known to be rich, \"people in society\" bowed to him, and\nhe received invitations in the town; he was called, in town, Monsieur\nMadeleine; his workmen and the children continued to call him Father\nMadeleine, and that was what was most adapted to make him smile. In\nproportion as he mounted, throve, invitations rained down upon him.\n\"Society\" claimed him for its own. The prim little drawing-rooms on\nM. sur M., which, of course, had at first been closed to the artisan,\nopened both leaves of their folding-doors to the millionnaire. They made\na thousand advances to him. He refused.\n\nThis time the good gossips had no trouble. \"He is an ignorant man, of\nno education. No one knows where he came from. He would not know how to\nbehave in society. It has not been absolutely proved that he knows how\nto read.\"\n\nWhen they saw him making money, they said, \"He is a man of business.\"\nWhen they saw him scattering his money about, they said, \"He is an\nambitious man.\" When he was seen to decline honors, they said, \"He is\nan adventurer.\" When they saw him repulse society, they said, \"He is a\nbrute.\"\n\nIn 1820, five years after his arrival in M. sur M., the services which\nhe had rendered to the district were so dazzling, the opinion of\nthe whole country round about was so unanimous, that the King again\nappointed him mayor of the town. He again declined; but the prefect\nresisted his refusal, all the notabilities of the place came to implore\nhim, the people in the street besought him; the urging was so vigorous\nthat he ended by accepting. It was noticed that the thing which seemed\nchiefly to bring him to a decision was the almost irritated apostrophe\naddressed to him by an old woman of the people, who called to him from\nher threshold, in an angry way: \"A good mayor is a useful thing. Is he\ndrawing back before the good which he can do?\"\n\nThis was the third phase of his ascent. Father Madeleine had become\nMonsieur Madeleine. Monsieur Madeleine became Monsieur le Maire.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III--SUMS DEPOSITED WITH LAFFITTE\n\nOn the other hand, he remained as simple as on the first day. He had\ngray hair, a serious eye, the sunburned complexion of a laborer, the\nthoughtful visage of a philosopher. He habitually wore a hat with a\nwide brim, and a long coat of coarse cloth, buttoned to the chin. He\nfulfilled his duties as mayor; but, with that exception, he lived in\nsolitude. He spoke to but few people. He avoided polite attentions;\nhe escaped quickly; he smiled to relieve himself of the necessity of\ntalking; he gave, in order to get rid of the necessity for smiling, The\nwomen said of him, \"What a good-natured bear!\" His pleasure consisted in\nstrolling in the fields.\n\nHe always took his meals alone, with an open book before him, which he\nread. He had a well-selected little library. He loved books; books\nare cold but safe friends. In proportion as leisure came to him with\nfortune, he seemed to take advantage of it to cultivate his mind. It had\nbeen observed that, ever since his arrival at M. sur M.. his language\nhad grown more polished, more choice, and more gentle with every passing\nyear. He liked to carry a gun with him on his strolls, but he rarely\nmade use of it. When he did happen to do so, his shooting was something\nso infallible as to inspire terror. He never killed an inoffensive\nanimal. He never shot at a little bird.\n\nAlthough he was no longer young, it was thought that he was still\nprodigiously strong. He offered his assistance to any one who was in\nneed of it, lifted a horse, released a wheel clogged in the mud, or\nstopped a runaway bull by the horns. He always had his pockets full\nof money when he went out; but they were empty on his return. When he\npassed through a village, the ragged brats ran joyously after him, and\nsurrounded him like a swarm of gnats.\n\nIt was thought that he must, in the past, have lived a country life,\nsince he knew all sorts of useful secrets, which he taught to the\npeasants. He taught them how to destroy scurf on wheat, by sprinkling it\nand the granary and inundating the cracks in the floor with a solution\nof common salt; and how to chase away weevils by hanging up orviot in\nbloom everywhere, on the walls and the ceilings, among the grass and in\nthe houses.\n\nHe had \"recipes\" for exterminating from a field, blight, tares, foxtail,\nand all parasitic growths which destroy the wheat. He defended a rabbit\nwarren against rats, simply by the odor of a guinea-pig which he placed\nin it.\n\nOne day he saw some country people busily engaged in pulling up nettles;\nhe examined the plants, which were uprooted and already dried, and said:\n\"They are dead. Nevertheless, it would be a good thing to know how to\nmake use of them. When the nettle is young, the leaf makes an excellent\nvegetable; when it is older, it has filaments and fibres like hemp and\nflax. Nettle cloth is as good as linen cloth. Chopped up, nettles are\ngood for poultry; pounded, they are good for horned cattle. The seed of\nthe nettle, mixed with fodder, gives gloss to the hair of animals; the\nroot, mixed with salt, produces a beautiful yellow coloring-matter.\nMoreover, it is an excellent hay, which can be cut twice. And what is\nrequired for the nettle? A little soil, no care, no culture. Only the\nseed falls as it is ripe, and it is difficult to collect it. That\nis all. With the exercise of a little care, the nettle could be made\nuseful; it is neglected and it becomes hurtful. It is exterminated. How\nmany men resemble the nettle!\" He added, after a pause: \"Remember this,\nmy friends: there are no such things as bad plants or bad men. There are\nonly bad cultivators.\"\n\nThe children loved him because he knew how to make charming little\ntrifles of straw and cocoanuts.\n\nWhen he saw the door of a church hung in black, he entered: he sought\nout funerals as other men seek christenings. Widowhood and the grief of\nothers attracted him, because of his great gentleness; he mingled with\nthe friends clad in mourning, with families dressed in black, with\nthe priests groaning around a coffin. He seemed to like to give to his\nthoughts for text these funereal psalmodies filled with the vision of\nthe other world. With his eyes fixed on heaven, he listened with a\nsort of aspiration towards all the mysteries of the infinite, those sad\nvoices which sing on the verge of the obscure abyss of death.\n\nHe performed a multitude of good actions, concealing his agency in them\nas a man conceals himself because of evil actions. He penetrated houses\nprivately, at night; he ascended staircases furtively. A poor wretch\non returning to his attic would find that his door had been opened,\nsometimes even forced, during his absence. The poor man made a clamor\nover it: some malefactor had been there! He entered, and the first\nthing he beheld was a piece of gold lying forgotten on some piece of\nfurniture. The \"malefactor\" who had been there was Father Madeleine.\n\nHe was affable and sad. The people said: \"There is a rich man who has\nnot a haughty air. There is a happy man who has not a contented air.\"\n\nSome people maintained that he was a mysterious person, and that no\none ever entered his chamber, which was a regular anchorite's cell,\nfurnished with winged hour-glasses and enlivened by cross-bones and\nskulls of dead men! This was much talked of, so that one of the elegant\nand malicious young women of M. sur M. came to him one day, and asked:\n\"Monsieur le Maire, pray show us your chamber. It is said to be a\ngrotto.\" He smiled, and introduced them instantly into this \"grotto.\"\nThey were well punished for their curiosity. The room was very simply\nfurnished in mahogany, which was rather ugly, like all furniture of\nthat sort, and hung with paper worth twelve sous. They could see nothing\nremarkable about it, except two candlesticks of antique pattern which\nstood on the chimney-piece and appeared to be silver, \"for they were\nhall-marked,\" an observation full of the type of wit of petty towns.\n\nNevertheless, people continued to say that no one ever got into the\nroom, and that it was a hermit's cave, a mysterious retreat, a hole, a\ntomb.\n\nIt was also whispered about that he had \"immense\" sums deposited with\nLaffitte, with this peculiar feature, that they were always at his\nimmediate disposal, so that, it was added, M. Madeleine could make his\nappearance at Laffitte's any morning, sign a receipt, and carry off his\ntwo or three millions in ten minutes. In reality, \"these two or three\nmillions\" were reducible, as we have said, to six hundred and thirty or\nforty thousand francs.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV--M. MADELEINE IN MOURNING\n\nAt the beginning of 1820 the newspapers announced the death of M.\nMyriel, Bishop of D----, surnamed \"Monseigneur Bienvenu,\" who had died\nin the odor of sanctity at the age of eighty-two.\n\nThe Bishop of D---- to supply here a detail which the papers\nomitted--had been blind for many years before his death, and content to\nbe blind, as his sister was beside him.\n\nLet us remark by the way, that to be blind and to be loved, is, in fact,\none of the most strangely exquisite forms of happiness upon this earth,\nwhere nothing is complete. To have continually at one's side a woman, a\ndaughter, a sister, a charming being, who is there because you need her\nand because she cannot do without you; to know that we are indispensable\nto a person who is necessary to us; to be able to incessantly measure\none's affection by the amount of her presence which she bestows on us,\nand to say to ourselves, \"Since she consecrates the whole of her time\nto me, it is because I possess the whole of her heart\"; to behold her\nthought in lieu of her face; to be able to verify the fidelity of one\nbeing amid the eclipse of the world; to regard the rustle of a gown\nas the sound of wings; to hear her come and go, retire, speak, return,\nsing, and to think that one is the centre of these steps, of this\nspeech; to manifest at each instant one's personal attraction; to feel\none's self all the more powerful because of one's infirmity; to become\nin one's obscurity, and through one's obscurity, the star around which\nthis angel gravitates,--few felicities equal this. The supreme happiness\nof life consists in the conviction that one is loved; loved for\none's own sake--let us say rather, loved in spite of one's self; this\nconviction the blind man possesses. To be served in distress is to be\ncaressed. Does he lack anything? No. One does not lose the sight when\none has love. And what love! A love wholly constituted of virtue! There\nis no blindness where there is certainty. Soul seeks soul, gropingly,\nand finds it. And this soul, found and tested, is a woman. A hand\nsustains you; it is hers: a mouth lightly touches your brow; it is her\nmouth: you hear a breath very near you; it is hers. To have everything\nof her, from her worship to her pity, never to be left, to have that\nsweet weakness aiding you, to lean upon that immovable reed, to\ntouch Providence with one's hands, and to be able to take it in\none's arms,--God made tangible,--what bliss! The heart, that obscure,\ncelestial flower, undergoes a mysterious blossoming. One would not\nexchange that shadow for all brightness! The angel soul is there,\nuninterruptedly there; if she departs, it is but to return again; she\nvanishes like a dream, and reappears like reality. One feels warmth\napproaching, and behold! she is there. One overflows with serenity, with\ngayety, with ecstasy; one is a radiance amid the night. And there are\na thousand little cares. Nothings, which are enormous in that void. The\nmost ineffable accents of the feminine voice employed to lull you, and\nsupplying the vanished universe to you. One is caressed with the soul.\nOne sees nothing, but one feels that one is adored. It is a paradise of\nshadows.\n\nIt was from this paradise that Monseigneur Welcome had passed to the\nother.\n\nThe announcement of his death was reprinted by the local journal of M.\nsur M. On the following day, M. Madeleine appeared clad wholly in black,\nand with crape on his hat.\n\nThis mourning was noticed in the town, and commented on. It seemed\nto throw a light on M. Madeleine's origin. It was concluded that some\nrelationship existed between him and the venerable Bishop. \"He has gone\ninto mourning for the Bishop of D----\" said the drawing-rooms; this\nraised M. Madeleine's credit greatly, and procured for him, instantly\nand at one blow, a certain consideration in the noble world of M. sur\nM. The microscopic Faubourg Saint-Germain of the place meditated raising\nthe quarantine against M. Madeleine, the probable relative of a bishop.\nM. Madeleine perceived the advancement which he had obtained, by the\nmore numerous courtesies of the old women and the more plentiful smiles\nof the young ones. One evening, a ruler in that petty great world, who\nwas curious by right of seniority, ventured to ask him, \"M. le Maire is\ndoubtless a cousin of the late Bishop of D----?\"\n\nHe said, \"No, Madame.\"\n\n\"But,\" resumed the dowager, \"you are wearing mourning for him.\"\n\nHe replied, \"It is because I was a servant in his family in my youth.\"\n\nAnother thing which was remarked, was, that every time that he\nencountered in the town a young Savoyard who was roaming about the\ncountry and seeking chimneys to sweep, the mayor had him summoned,\ninquired his name, and gave him money. The little Savoyards told each\nother about it: a great many of them passed that way.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V--VAGUE FLASHES ON THE HORIZON\n\nLittle by little, and in the course of time, all this opposition\nsubsided. There had at first been exercised against M. Madeleine,\nin virtue of a sort of law which all those who rise must submit to,\nblackening and calumnies; then they grew to be nothing more than\nill-nature, then merely malicious remarks, then even this entirely\ndisappeared; respect became complete, unanimous, cordial, and towards\n1821 the moment arrived when the word \"Monsieur le Maire\" was pronounced\nat M. sur M. with almost the same accent as \"Monseigneur the Bishop\"\nhad been pronounced in D---- in 1815. People came from a distance of ten\nleagues around to consult M. Madeleine. He put an end to differences,\nhe prevented lawsuits, he reconciled enemies. Every one took him for the\njudge, and with good reason. It seemed as though he had for a soul the\nbook of the natural law. It was like an epidemic of veneration, which in\nthe course of six or seven years gradually took possession of the whole\ndistrict.\n\nOne single man in the town, in the arrondissement, absolutely escaped\nthis contagion, and, whatever Father Madeleine did, remained his\nopponent as though a sort of incorruptible and imperturbable instinct\nkept him on the alert and uneasy. It seems, in fact, as though there\nexisted in certain men a veritable bestial instinct, though pure and\nupright, like all instincts, which creates antipathies and sympathies,\nwhich fatally separates one nature from another nature, which does not\nhesitate, which feels no disquiet, which does not hold its peace,\nand which never belies itself, clear in its obscurity, infallible,\nimperious, intractable, stubborn to all counsels of the intelligence\nand to all the dissolvents of reason, and which, in whatever manner\ndestinies are arranged, secretly warns the man-dog of the presence of\nthe man-cat, and the man-fox of the presence of the man-lion.\n\nIt frequently happened that when M. Madeleine was passing along a\nstreet, calm, affectionate, surrounded by the blessings of all, a man of\nlofty stature, clad in an iron-gray frock-coat, armed with a heavy\ncane, and wearing a battered hat, turned round abruptly behind him, and\nfollowed him with his eyes until he disappeared, with folded arms and\na slow shake of the head, and his upper lip raised in company with\nhis lower to his nose, a sort of significant grimace which might be\ntranslated by: \"What is that man, after all? I certainly have seen him\nsomewhere. In any case, I am not his dupe.\"\n\nThis person, grave with a gravity which was almost menacing, was one\nof those men who, even when only seen by a rapid glimpse, arrest the\nspectator's attention.\n\nHis name was Javert, and he belonged to the police.\n\nAt M. sur M. he exercised the unpleasant but useful functions of an\ninspector. He had not seen Madeleine's beginnings. Javert owed the post\nwhich he occupied to the protection of M. Chabouillet, the secretary of\nthe Minister of State, Comte Angeles, then prefect of police at Paris.\nWhen Javert arrived at M. sur M. the fortune of the great manufacturer\nwas already made, and Father Madeleine had become Monsieur Madeleine.\n\nCertain police officers have a peculiar physiognomy, which is\ncomplicated with an air of baseness mingled with an air of authority.\nJavert possessed this physiognomy minus the baseness.\n\nIt is our conviction that if souls were visible to the eyes, we should\nbe able to see distinctly that strange thing that each one individual\nof the human race corresponds to some one of the species of the animal\ncreation; and we could easily recognize this truth, hardly perceived\nby the thinker, that from the oyster to the eagle, from the pig to the\ntiger, all animals exist in man, and that each one of them is in a man.\nSometimes even several of them at a time.\n\nAnimals are nothing else than the figures of our virtues and our vices,\nstraying before our eyes, the visible phantoms of our souls. God shows\nthem to us in order to induce us to reflect. Only since animals are mere\nshadows, God has not made them capable of education in the full sense\nof the word; what is the use? On the contrary, our souls being realities\nand having a goal which is appropriate to them, God has bestowed on\nthem intelligence; that is to say, the possibility of education. Social\neducation, when well done, can always draw from a soul, of whatever sort\nit may be, the utility which it contains.\n\nThis, be it said, is of course from the restricted point of view of the\nterrestrial life which is apparent, and without prejudging the profound\nquestion of the anterior or ulterior personality of the beings which are\nnot man. The visible _I_ in nowise authorizes the thinker to deny the\nlatent _I_. Having made this reservation, let us pass on.\n\nNow, if the reader will admit, for a moment, with us, that in every man\nthere is one of the animal species of creation, it will be easy for us\nto say what there was in Police Officer Javert.\n\nThe peasants of Asturias are convinced that in every litter of wolves\nthere is one dog, which is killed by the mother because, otherwise, as\nhe grew up, he would devour the other little ones.\n\nGive to this dog-son of a wolf a human face, and the result will be\nJavert.\n\nJavert had been born in prison, of a fortune-teller, whose husband was\nin the galleys. As he grew up, he thought that he was outside the pale\nof society, and he despaired of ever re-entering it. He observed that\nsociety unpardoningly excludes two classes of men,--those who attack\nit and those who guard it; he had no choice except between these\ntwo classes; at the same time, he was conscious of an indescribable\nfoundation of rigidity, regularity, and probity, complicated with an\ninexpressible hatred for the race of bohemians whence he was sprung. He\nentered the police; he succeeded there. At forty years of age he was an\ninspector.\n\nDuring his youth he had been employed in the convict establishments of\nthe South.\n\nBefore proceeding further, let us come to an understanding as to the\nwords, \"human face,\" which we have just applied to Javert.\n\nThe human face of Javert consisted of a flat nose, with two deep\nnostrils, towards which enormous whiskers ascended on his cheeks. One\nfelt ill at ease when he saw these two forests and these two caverns\nfor the first time. When Javert laughed,--and his laugh was rare and\nterrible,--his thin lips parted and revealed to view not only his teeth,\nbut his gums, and around his nose there formed a flattened and savage\nfold, as on the muzzle of a wild beast. Javert, serious, was a watchdog;\nwhen he laughed, he was a tiger. As for the rest, he had very little\nskull and a great deal of jaw; his hair concealed his forehead and\nfell over his eyebrows; between his eyes there was a permanent, central\nfrown, like an imprint of wrath; his gaze was obscure; his mouth pursed\nup and terrible; his air that of ferocious command.\n\nThis man was composed of two very simple and two very good sentiments,\ncomparatively; but he rendered them almost bad, by dint of exaggerating\nthem,--respect for authority, hatred of rebellion; and in his eyes,\nmurder, robbery, all crimes, are only forms of rebellion. He enveloped\nin a blind and profound faith every one who had a function in the state,\nfrom the prime minister to the rural policeman. He covered with scorn,\naversion, and disgust every one who had once crossed the legal threshold\nof evil. He was absolute, and admitted no exceptions. On the one hand,\nhe said, \"The functionary can make no mistake; the magistrate is never\nthe wrong.\" On the other hand, he said, \"These men are irremediably\nlost. Nothing good can come from them.\" He fully shared the opinion of\nthose extreme minds which attribute to human law I know not what power\nof making, or, if the reader will have it so, of authenticating, demons,\nand who place a Styx at the base of society. He was stoical, serious,\naustere; a melancholy dreamer, humble and haughty, like fanatics. His\nglance was like a gimlet, cold and piercing. His whole life hung on\nthese two words: watchfulness and supervision. He had introduced a\nstraight line into what is the most crooked thing in the world;\nhe possessed the conscience of his usefulness, the religion of his\nfunctions, and he was a spy as other men are priests. Woe to the man\nwho fell into his hands! He would have arrested his own father, if\nthe latter had escaped from the galleys, and would have denounced his\nmother, if she had broken her ban. And he would have done it with that\nsort of inward satisfaction which is conferred by virtue. And, withal,\na life of privation, isolation, abnegation, chastity, with never\na diversion. It was implacable duty; the police understood, as the\nSpartans understood Sparta, a pitiless lying in wait, a ferocious\nhonesty, a marble informer, Brutus in Vidocq.\n\nJavert's whole person was expressive of the man who spies and who\nwithdraws himself from observation. The mystical school of Joseph de\nMaistre, which at that epoch seasoned with lofty cosmogony those things\nwhich were called the ultra newspapers, would not have failed to declare\nthat Javert was a symbol. His brow was not visible; it disappeared\nbeneath his hat: his eyes were not visible, since they were lost under\nhis eyebrows: his chin was not visible, for it was plunged in his\ncravat: his hands were not visible; they were drawn up in his sleeves:\nand his cane was not visible; he carried it under his coat. But when the\noccasion presented itself, there was suddenly seen to emerge from all\nthis shadow, as from an ambuscade, a narrow and angular forehead, a\nbaleful glance, a threatening chin, enormous hands, and a monstrous\ncudgel.\n\nIn his leisure moments, which were far from frequent, he read, although\nhe hated books; this caused him to be not wholly illiterate. This could\nbe recognized by some emphasis in his speech.\n\nAs we have said, he had no vices. When he was pleased with himself,\nhe permitted himself a pinch of snuff. Therein lay his connection with\nhumanity.\n\nThe reader will have no difficulty in understanding that Javert was the\nterror of that whole class which the annual statistics of the Ministry\nof Justice designates under the rubric, Vagrants. The name of Javert\nrouted them by its mere utterance; the face of Javert petrified them at\nsight.\n\nSuch was this formidable man.\n\nJavert was like an eye constantly fixed on M. Madeleine. An eye full of\nsuspicion and conjecture. M. Madeleine had finally perceived the fact;\nbut it seemed to be of no importance to him. He did not even put a\nquestion to Javert; he neither sought nor avoided him; he bore that\nembarrassing and almost oppressive gaze without appearing to notice it.\nHe treated Javert with ease and courtesy, as he did all the rest of the\nworld.\n\nIt was divined, from some words which escaped Javert, that he had\nsecretly investigated, with that curiosity which belongs to the race,\nand into which there enters as much instinct as will, all the anterior\ntraces which Father Madeleine might have left elsewhere. He seemed to\nknow, and he sometimes said in covert words, that some one had gleaned\ncertain information in a certain district about a family which had\ndisappeared. Once he chanced to say, as he was talking to himself, \"I\nthink I have him!\" Then he remained pensive for three days, and uttered\nnot a word. It seemed that the thread which he thought he held had\nbroken.\n\nMoreover, and this furnishes the necessary corrective for the too\nabsolute sense which certain words might present, there can be nothing\nreally infallible in a human creature, and the peculiarity of instinct\nis that it can become confused, thrown off the track, and defeated.\nOtherwise, it would be superior to intelligence, and the beast would be\nfound to be provided with a better light than man.\n\nJavert was evidently somewhat disconcerted by the perfect naturalness\nand tranquillity of M. Madeleine.\n\nOne day, nevertheless, his strange manner appeared to produce an\nimpression on M. Madeleine. It was on the following occasion.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI--FATHER FAUCHELEVENT\n\nOne morning M. Madeleine was passing through an unpaved alley of M. sur\nM.; he heard a noise, and saw a group some distance away. He approached.\nAn old man named Father Fauchelevent had just fallen beneath his cart,\nhis horse having tumbled down.\n\nThis Fauchelevent was one of the few enemies whom M. Madeleine had at\nthat time. When Madeleine arrived in the neighborhood, Fauchelevent, an\nex-notary and a peasant who was almost educated, had a business which\nwas beginning to be in a bad way. Fauchelevent had seen this simple\nworkman grow rich, while he, a lawyer, was being ruined. This had filled\nhim with jealousy, and he had done all he could, on every occasion,\nto injure Madeleine. Then bankruptcy had come; and as the old man had\nnothing left but a cart and a horse, and neither family nor children, he\nhad turned carter.\n\nThe horse had two broken legs and could not rise. The old man was caught\nin the wheels. The fall had been so unlucky that the whole weight of the\nvehicle rested on his breast. The cart was quite heavily laden. Father\nFauchelevent was rattling in the throat in the most lamentable manner.\nThey had tried, but in vain, to drag him out. An unmethodical effort,\naid awkwardly given, a wrong shake, might kill him. It was impossible to\ndisengage him otherwise than by lifting the vehicle off of him.\nJavert, who had come up at the moment of the accident, had sent for a\njack-screw.\n\nM. Madeleine arrived. People stood aside respectfully.\n\n\"Help!\" cried old Fauchelevent. \"Who will be good and save the old man?\"\n\nM. Madeleine turned towards those present:--\n\n\"Is there a jack-screw to be had?\"\n\n\"One has been sent for,\" answered the peasant.\n\n\"How long will it take to get it?\"\n\n\"They have gone for the nearest, to Flachot's place, where there is a\nfarrier; but it makes no difference; it will take a good quarter of an\nhour.\"\n\n\"A quarter of an hour!\" exclaimed Madeleine.\n\nIt had rained on the preceding night; the soil was soaked.\n\nThe cart was sinking deeper into the earth every moment, and crushing\nthe old carter's breast more and more. It was evident that his ribs\nwould be broken in five minutes more.\n\n\"It is impossible to wait another quarter of an hour,\" said Madeleine to\nthe peasants, who were staring at him.\n\n\"We must!\"\n\n\"But it will be too late then! Don't you see that the cart is sinking?\"\n\n\"Well!\"\n\n\"Listen,\" resumed Madeleine; \"there is still room enough under the cart\nto allow a man to crawl beneath it and raise it with his back. Only half\na minute, and the poor man can be taken out. Is there any one here who\nhas stout loins and heart? There are five louis d'or to be earned!\"\n\nNot a man in the group stirred.\n\n\"Ten louis,\" said Madeleine.\n\nThe persons present dropped their eyes. One of them muttered: \"A man\nwould need to be devilish strong. And then he runs the risk of getting\ncrushed!\"\n\n\"Come,\" began Madeleine again, \"twenty louis.\"\n\nThe same silence.\n\n\"It is not the will which is lacking,\" said a voice.\n\nM. Madeleine turned round, and recognized Javert. He had not noticed him\non his arrival.\n\nJavert went on:--\n\n\"It is strength. One would have to be a terrible man to do such a thing\nas lift a cart like that on his back.\"\n\nThen, gazing fixedly at M. Madeleine, he went on, emphasizing every word\nthat he uttered:--\n\n\"Monsieur Madeleine, I have never known but one man capable of doing\nwhat you ask.\"\n\nMadeleine shuddered.\n\nJavert added, with an air of indifference, but without removing his eyes\nfrom Madeleine:--\n\n\"He was a convict.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" said Madeleine.\n\n\"In the galleys at Toulon.\"\n\nMadeleine turned pale.\n\nMeanwhile, the cart continued to sink slowly. Father Fauchelevent\nrattled in the throat, and shrieked:--\n\n\"I am strangling! My ribs are breaking! a screw! something! Ah!\"\n\nMadeleine glanced about him.\n\n\"Is there, then, no one who wishes to earn twenty louis and save the\nlife of this poor old man?\"\n\nNo one stirred. Javert resumed:--\n\n\"I have never known but one man who could take the place of a screw, and\nhe was that convict.\"\n\n\"Ah! It is crushing me!\" cried the old man.\n\nMadeleine raised his head, met Javert's falcon eye still fixed upon\nhim, looked at the motionless peasants, and smiled sadly. Then, without\nsaying a word, he fell on his knees, and before the crowd had even had\ntime to utter a cry, he was underneath the vehicle.\n\nA terrible moment of expectation and silence ensued.\n\nThey beheld Madeleine, almost flat on his stomach beneath that terrible\nweight, make two vain efforts to bring his knees and his elbows\ntogether. They shouted to him, \"Father Madeleine, come out!\" Old\nFauchelevent himself said to him, \"Monsieur Madeleine, go away! You see\nthat I am fated to die! Leave me! You will get yourself crushed also!\"\nMadeleine made no reply.\n\nAll the spectators were panting. The wheels had continued to sink, and\nit had become almost impossible for Madeleine to make his way from under\nthe vehicle.\n\nSuddenly the enormous mass was seen to quiver, the cart rose slowly, the\nwheels half emerged from the ruts. They heard a stifled voice crying,\n\"Make haste! Help!\" It was Madeleine, who had just made a final effort.\n\nThey rushed forwards. The devotion of a single man had given force and\ncourage to all. The cart was raised by twenty arms. Old Fauchelevent was\nsaved.\n\nMadeleine rose. He was pale, though dripping with perspiration. His\nclothes were torn and covered with mud. All wept. The old man kissed\nhis knees and called him the good God. As for him, he bore upon\nhis countenance an indescribable expression of happy and celestial\nsuffering, and he fixed his tranquil eye on Javert, who was still\nstaring at him.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII--FAUCHELEVENT BECOMES A GARDENER IN PARIS\n\n\nFauchelevent had dislocated his kneepan in his fall. Father Madeleine\nhad him conveyed to an infirmary which he had established for his\nworkmen in the factory building itself, and which was served by two\nsisters of charity. On the following morning the old man found a\nthousand-franc bank-note on his night-stand, with these words in Father\nMadeleine's writing: \"I purchase your horse and cart.\" The cart was\nbroken, and the horse was dead. Fauchelevent recovered, but his knee\nremained stiff. M. Madeleine, on the recommendation of the sisters of\ncharity and of his priest, got the good man a place as gardener in a\nfemale convent in the Rue Saint-Antoine in Paris.\n\nSome time afterwards, M. Madeleine was appointed mayor. The first time\nthat Javert beheld M. Madeleine clothed in the scarf which gave him\nauthority over the town, he felt the sort of shudder which a watch-dog\nmight experience on smelling a wolf in his master's clothes. From\nthat time forth he avoided him as much as he possibly could. When the\nrequirements of the service imperatively demanded it, and he could\nnot do otherwise than meet the mayor, he addressed him with profound\nrespect.\n\nThis prosperity created at M. sur M. by Father Madeleine had, besides\nthe visible signs which we have mentioned, another symptom which was\nnone the less significant for not being visible. This never deceives.\nWhen the population suffers, when work is lacking, when there is no\ncommerce, the tax-payer resists imposts through penury, he exhausts and\noversteps his respite, and the state expends a great deal of money in\nthe charges for compelling and collection. When work is abundant, when\nthe country is rich and happy, the taxes are paid easily and cost the\nstate nothing. It may be said, that there is one infallible thermometer\nof the public misery and riches,--the cost of collecting the taxes.\nIn the course of seven years the expense of collecting the taxes had\ndiminished three-fourths in the arrondissement of M. sur M., and this\nled to this arrondissement being frequently cited from all the rest by\nM. de Villele, then Minister of Finance.\n\nSuch was the condition of the country when Fantine returned thither. No\none remembered her. Fortunately, the door of M. Madeleine's factory was\nlike the face of a friend. She presented herself there, and was admitted\nto the women's workroom. The trade was entirely new to Fantine; she\ncould not be very skilful at it, and she therefore earned but little by\nher day's work; but it was sufficient; the problem was solved; she was\nearning her living.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII--MADAME VICTURNIEN EXPENDS THIRTY FRANCS ON MORALITY\n\nWhen Fantine saw that she was making her living, she felt joyful for a\nmoment. To live honestly by her own labor, what mercy from heaven! The\ntaste for work had really returned to her. She bought a looking-glass,\ntook pleasure in surveying in it her youth, her beautiful hair, her fine\nteeth; she forgot many things; she thought only of Cosette and of the\npossible future, and was almost happy. She hired a little room and\nfurnished on credit on the strength of her future work--a lingering\ntrace of her improvident ways. As she was not able to say that she was\nmarried she took good care, as we have seen, not to mention her little\ngirl.\n\nAt first, as the reader has seen, she paid the Thenardiers promptly. As\nshe only knew how to sign her name, she was obliged to write through a\npublic letter-writer.\n\nShe wrote often, and this was noticed. It began to be said in an\nundertone, in the women's workroom, that Fantine \"wrote letters\" and\nthat \"she had ways about her.\"\n\nThere is no one for spying on people's actions like those who are\nnot concerned in them. Why does that gentleman never come except at\nnightfall? Why does Mr. So-and-So never hang his key on its nail on\nTuesday? Why does he always take the narrow streets? Why does Madame\nalways descend from her hackney-coach before reaching her house? Why\ndoes she send out to purchase six sheets of note paper, when she has a\n\"whole stationer's shop full of it?\" etc. There exist beings who, for\nthe sake of obtaining the key to these enigmas, which are, moreover, of\nno consequence whatever to them, spend more money, waste more time,\ntake more trouble, than would be required for ten good actions, and\nthat gratuitously, for their own pleasure, without receiving any other\npayment for their curiosity than curiosity. They will follow up such and\nsuch a man or woman for whole days; they will do sentry duty for hours\nat a time on the corners of the streets, under alley-way doors at night,\nin cold and rain; they will bribe errand-porters, they will make the\ndrivers of hackney-coaches and lackeys tipsy, buy a waiting-maid, suborn\na porter. Why? For no reason. A pure passion for seeing, knowing,\nand penetrating into things. A pure itch for talking. And often\nthese secrets once known, these mysteries made public, these enigmas\nilluminated by the light of day, bring on catastrophies, duels,\nfailures, the ruin of families, and broken lives, to the great joy\nof those who have \"found out everything,\" without any interest in the\nmatter, and by pure instinct. A sad thing.\n\nCertain persons are malicious solely through a necessity for talking.\nTheir conversation, the chat of the drawing-room, gossip of the\nanteroom, is like those chimneys which consume wood rapidly; they need\na great amount of combustibles; and their combustibles are furnished by\ntheir neighbors.\n\nSo Fantine was watched.\n\nIn addition, many a one was jealous of her golden hair and of her white\nteeth.\n\nIt was remarked that in the workroom she often turned aside, in the\nmidst of the rest, to wipe away a tear. These were the moments when she\nwas thinking of her child; perhaps, also, of the man whom she had loved.\n\nBreaking the gloomy bonds of the past is a mournful task.\n\nIt was observed that she wrote twice a month at least, and that she\npaid the carriage on the letter. They managed to obtain the address:\nMonsieur, Monsieur Thenardier, inn-keeper at Montfermeil. The public\nwriter, a good old man who could not fill his stomach with red wine\nwithout emptying his pocket of secrets, was made to talk in the\nwine-shop. In short, it was discovered that Fantine had a child. \"She\nmust be a pretty sort of a woman.\" An old gossip was found, who made the\ntrip to Montfermeil, talked to the Thenardiers, and said on her return:\n\"For my five and thirty francs I have freed my mind. I have seen the\nchild.\"\n\nThe gossip who did this thing was a gorgon named Madame Victurnien, the\nguardian and door-keeper of every one's virtue. Madame Victurnien was\nfifty-six, and re-enforced the mask of ugliness with the mask of age.\nA quavering voice, a whimsical mind. This old dame had once been\nyoung--astonishing fact! In her youth, in '93, she had married a\nmonk who had fled from his cloister in a red cap, and passed from\nthe Bernardines to the Jacobins. She was dry, rough, peevish, sharp,\ncaptious, almost venomous; all this in memory of her monk, whose widow\nshe was, and who had ruled over her masterfully and bent her to his\nwill. She was a nettle in which the rustle of the cassock was visible.\nAt the Restoration she had turned bigot, and that with so much energy\nthat the priests had forgiven her her monk. She had a small property,\nwhich she bequeathed with much ostentation to a religious community.\nShe was in high favor at the episcopal palace of Arras. So this Madame\nVicturnien went to Montfermeil, and returned with the remark, \"I have\nseen the child.\"\n\nAll this took time. Fantine had been at the factory for more than a\nyear, when, one morning, the superintendent of the workroom handed her\nfifty francs from the mayor, told her that she was no longer employed\nin the shop, and requested her, in the mayor's name, to leave the\nneighborhood.\n\nThis was the very month when the Thenardiers, after having demanded\ntwelve francs instead of six, had just exacted fifteen francs instead of\ntwelve.\n\nFantine was overwhelmed. She could not leave the neighborhood; she was\nin debt for her rent and furniture. Fifty francs was not sufficient\nto cancel this debt. She stammered a few supplicating words. The\nsuperintendent ordered her to leave the shop on the instant. Besides,\nFantine was only a moderately good workwoman. Overcome with shame, even\nmore than with despair, she quitted the shop, and returned to her room.\nSo her fault was now known to every one.\n\nShe no longer felt strong enough to say a word. She was advised to\nsee the mayor; she did not dare. The mayor had given her fifty francs\nbecause he was good, and had dismissed her because he was just. She\nbowed before the decision.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX--MADAME VICTURNIEN'S SUCCESS\n\nSo the monk's widow was good for something.\n\nBut M. Madeleine had heard nothing of all this. Life is full of just\nsuch combinations of events. M. Madeleine was in the habit of almost\nnever entering the women's workroom.\n\nAt the head of this room he had placed an elderly spinster, whom\nthe priest had provided for him, and he had full confidence in this\nsuperintendent,--a truly respectable person, firm, equitable, upright,\nfull of the charity which consists in giving, but not having in the same\ndegree that charity which consists in understanding and in forgiving.\nM. Madeleine relied wholly on her. The best men are often obliged\nto delegate their authority. It was with this full power, and the\nconviction that she was doing right, that the superintendent had\ninstituted the suit, judged, condemned, and executed Fantine.\n\nAs regards the fifty francs, she had given them from a fund which M.\nMadeleine had intrusted to her for charitable purposes, and for giving\nassistance to the workwomen, and of which she rendered no account.\n\nFantine tried to obtain a situation as a servant in the neighborhood;\nshe went from house to house. No one would have her. She could not\nleave town. The second-hand dealer, to whom she was in debt for her\nfurniture--and what furniture!--said to her, \"If you leave, I will have\nyou arrested as a thief.\" The householder, whom she owed for her rent,\nsaid to her, \"You are young and pretty; you can pay.\" She divided the\nfifty francs between the landlord and the furniture-dealer, returned to\nthe latter three-quarters of his goods, kept only necessaries, and found\nherself without work, without a trade, with nothing but her bed, and\nstill about fifty francs in debt.\n\nShe began to make coarse shirts for soldiers of the garrison, and earned\ntwelve sous a day. Her daughter cost her ten. It was at this point that\nshe began to pay the Thenardiers irregularly.\n\nHowever, the old woman who lighted her candle for her when she returned\nat night, taught her the art of living in misery. Back of living on\nlittle, there is the living on nothing. These are the two chambers; the\nfirst is dark, the second is black.\n\nFantine learned how to live without fire entirely in the winter; how to\ngive up a bird which eats a half a farthing's worth of millet every\ntwo days; how to make a coverlet of one's petticoat, and a petticoat of\none's coverlet; how to save one's candle, by taking one's meals by\nthe light of the opposite window. No one knows all that certain feeble\ncreatures, who have grown old in privation and honesty, can get out of\na sou. It ends by being a talent. Fantine acquired this sublime talent,\nand regained a little courage.\n\nAt this epoch she said to a neighbor, \"Bah! I say to myself, by only\nsleeping five hours, and working all the rest of the time at my sewing,\nI shall always manage to nearly earn my bread. And, then, when one is\nsad, one eats less. Well, sufferings, uneasiness, a little bread on one\nhand, trouble on the other,--all this will support me.\"\n\nIt would have been a great happiness to have her little girl with her in\nthis distress. She thought of having her come. But what then! Make her\nshare her own destitution! And then, she was in debt to the Thenardiers!\nHow could she pay them? And the journey! How pay for that?\n\nThe old woman who had given her lessons in what may be called the life\nof indigence, was a sainted spinster named Marguerite, who was pious\nwith a true piety, poor and charitable towards the poor, and even\ntowards the rich, knowing how to write just sufficiently to sign herself\nMarguerite, and believing in God, which is science.\n\nThere are many such virtuous people in this lower world; some day they\nwill be in the world above. This life has a morrow.\n\nAt first, Fantine had been so ashamed that she had not dared to go out.\n\nWhen she was in the street, she divined that people turned round behind\nher, and pointed at her; every one stared at her and no one greeted her;\nthe cold and bitter scorn of the passers-by penetrated her very flesh\nand soul like a north wind.\n\nIt seems as though an unfortunate woman were utterly bare beneath the\nsarcasm and the curiosity of all in small towns. In Paris, at least, no\none knows you, and this obscurity is a garment. Oh! how she would have\nliked to betake herself to Paris! Impossible!\n\nShe was obliged to accustom herself to disrepute, as she had accustomed\nherself to indigence. Gradually she decided on her course. At the\nexpiration of two or three months she shook off her shame, and began to\ngo about as though there were nothing the matter. \"It is all the same to\nme,\" she said.\n\nShe went and came, bearing her head well up, with a bitter smile, and\nwas conscious that she was becoming brazen-faced.\n\nMadame Victurnien sometimes saw her passing, from her window, noticed\nthe distress of \"that creature\" who, \"thanks to her,\" had been \"put back\nin her proper place,\" and congratulated herself. The happiness of the\nevil-minded is black.\n\nExcess of toil wore out Fantine, and the little dry cough which troubled\nher increased. She sometimes said to her neighbor, Marguerite, \"Just\nfeel how hot my hands are!\"\n\nNevertheless, when she combed her beautiful hair in the morning with\nan old broken comb, and it flowed about her like floss silk, she\nexperienced a moment of happy coquetry.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X--RESULT OF THE SUCCESS\n\nShe had been dismissed towards the end of the winter; the summer passed,\nbut winter came again. Short days, less work. Winter: no warmth,\nno light, no noonday, the evening joining on to the morning, fogs,\ntwilight; the window is gray; it is impossible to see clearly at it. The\nsky is but a vent-hole. The whole day is a cavern. The sun has the air\nof a beggar. A frightful season! Winter changes the water of heaven and\nthe heart of man into a stone. Her creditors harrassed her.\n\nFantine earned too little. Her debts had increased. The Thenardiers, who\nwere not promptly paid, wrote to her constantly letters whose contents\ndrove her to despair, and whose carriage ruined her. One day they wrote\nto her that her little Cosette was entirely naked in that cold weather,\nthat she needed a woollen skirt, and that her mother must send at least\nten francs for this. She received the letter, and crushed it in her\nhands all day long. That evening she went into a barber's shop at the\ncorner of the street, and pulled out her comb. Her admirable golden hair\nfell to her knees.\n\n\"What splendid hair!\" exclaimed the barber.\n\n\"How much will you give me for it?\" said she.\n\n\"Ten francs.\"\n\n\"Cut it off.\"\n\nShe purchased a knitted petticoat and sent it to the Thenardiers. This\npetticoat made the Thenardiers furious. It was the money that they\nwanted. They gave the petticoat to Eponine. The poor Lark continued to\nshiver.\n\nFantine thought: \"My child is no longer cold. I have clothed her with my\nhair.\" She put on little round caps which concealed her shorn head, and\nin which she was still pretty.\n\nDark thoughts held possession of Fantine's heart.\n\nWhen she saw that she could no longer dress her hair, she began to hate\nevery one about her. She had long shared the universal veneration for\nFather Madeleine; yet, by dint of repeating to herself that it was he\nwho had discharged her, that he was the cause of her unhappiness, she\ncame to hate him also, and most of all. When she passed the factory in\nworking hours, when the workpeople were at the door, she affected to\nlaugh and sing.\n\nAn old workwoman who once saw her laughing and singing in this fashion\nsaid, \"There's a girl who will come to a bad end.\"\n\nShe took a lover, the first who offered, a man whom she did not love,\nout of bravado and with rage in her heart. He was a miserable scamp,\na sort of mendicant musician, a lazy beggar, who beat her, and who\nabandoned her as she had taken him, in disgust.\n\nShe adored her child.\n\nThe lower she descended, the darker everything grew about her, the more\nradiant shone that little angel at the bottom of her heart. She said,\n\"When I get rich, I will have my Cosette with me;\" and she laughed. Her\ncough did not leave her, and she had sweats on her back.\n\nOne day she received from the Thenardiers a letter couched in the\nfollowing terms: \"Cosette is ill with a malady which is going the rounds\nof the neighborhood. A miliary fever, they call it. Expensive drugs are\nrequired. This is ruining us, and we can no longer pay for them. If you\ndo not send us forty francs before the week is out, the little one will\nbe dead.\"\n\nShe burst out laughing, and said to her old neighbor: \"Ah! they are\ngood! Forty francs! the idea! That makes two napoleons! Where do they\nthink I am to get them? These peasants are stupid, truly.\"\n\nNevertheless she went to a dormer window in the staircase and read the\nletter once more. Then she descended the stairs and emerged, running and\nleaping and still laughing.\n\nSome one met her and said to her, \"What makes you so gay?\"\n\nShe replied: \"A fine piece of stupidity that some country people have\nwritten to me. They demand forty francs of me. So much for you, you\npeasants!\"\n\nAs she crossed the square, she saw a great many people collected around\na carriage of eccentric shape, upon the top of which stood a man dressed\nin red, who was holding forth. He was a quack dentist on his rounds,\nwho was offering to the public full sets of teeth, opiates, powders and\nelixirs.\n\nFantine mingled in the group, and began to laugh with the rest at\nthe harangue, which contained slang for the populace and jargon for\nrespectable people. The tooth-puller espied the lovely, laughing girl,\nand suddenly exclaimed: \"You have beautiful teeth, you girl there, who\nare laughing; if you want to sell me your palettes, I will give you a\ngold napoleon apiece for them.\"\n\n\"What are my palettes?\" asked Fantine.\n\n\"The palettes,\" replied the dental professor, \"are the front teeth, the\ntwo upper ones.\"\n\n\"How horrible!\" exclaimed Fantine.\n\n\"Two napoleons!\" grumbled a toothless old woman who was present. \"Here's\na lucky girl!\"\n\nFantine fled and stopped her ears that she might not hear the hoarse\nvoice of the man shouting to her: \"Reflect, my beauty! two napoleons;\nthey may prove of service. If your heart bids you, come this evening to\nthe inn of the Tillac d'Argent; you will find me there.\"\n\nFantine returned home. She was furious, and related the occurrence to\nher good neighbor Marguerite: \"Can you understand such a thing? Is he\nnot an abominable man? How can they allow such people to go about the\ncountry! Pull out my two front teeth! Why, I should be horrible! My hair\nwill grow again, but my teeth! Ah! what a monster of a man! I should\nprefer to throw myself head first on the pavement from the fifth story!\nHe told me that he should be at the Tillac d'Argent this evening.\"\n\n\"And what did he offer?\" asked Marguerite.\n\n\"Two napoleons.\"\n\n\"That makes forty francs.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Fantine; \"that makes forty francs.\"\n\nShe remained thoughtful, and began her work. At the expiration of a\nquarter of an hour she left her sewing and went to read the Thenardiers'\nletter once more on the staircase.\n\nOn her return, she said to Marguerite, who was at work beside her:--\n\n\"What is a miliary fever? Do you know?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" answered the old spinster; \"it is a disease.\"\n\n\"Does it require many drugs?\"\n\n\"Oh! terrible drugs.\"\n\n\"How does one get it?\"\n\n\"It is a malady that one gets without knowing how.\"\n\n\"Then it attacks children?\"\n\n\"Children in particular.\"\n\n\"Do people die of it?\"\n\n\"They may,\" said Marguerite.\n\nFantine left the room and went to read her letter once more on the\nstaircase.\n\nThat evening she went out, and was seen to turn her steps in the\ndirection of the Rue de Paris, where the inns are situated.\n\nThe next morning, when Marguerite entered Fantine's room before\ndaylight,--for they always worked together, and in this manner used only\none candle for the two,--she found Fantine seated on her bed, pale and\nfrozen. She had not lain down. Her cap had fallen on her knees.\nHer candle had burned all night, and was almost entirely consumed.\nMarguerite halted on the threshold, petrified at this tremendous\nwastefulness, and exclaimed:--\n\n\"Lord! the candle is all burned out! Something has happened.\"\n\nThen she looked at Fantine, who turned toward her her head bereft of its\nhair.\n\nFantine had grown ten years older since the preceding night.\n\n\"Jesus!\" said Marguerite, \"what is the matter with you, Fantine?\"\n\n\"Nothing,\" replied Fantine. \"Quite the contrary. My child will not die\nof that frightful malady, for lack of succor. I am content.\"\n\nSo saying, she pointed out to the spinster two napoleons which were\nglittering on the table.\n\n\"Ah! Jesus God!\" cried Marguerite. \"Why, it is a fortune! Where did you\nget those louis d'or?\"\n\n\"I got them,\" replied Fantine.\n\nAt the same time she smiled. The candle illuminated her countenance. It\nwas a bloody smile. A reddish saliva soiled the corners of her lips, and\nshe had a black hole in her mouth.\n\nThe two teeth had been extracted.\n\nShe sent the forty francs to Montfermeil.\n\nAfter all it was a ruse of the Thenardiers to obtain money. Cosette was\nnot ill.\n\nFantine threw her mirror out of the window. She had long since quitted\nher cell on the second floor for an attic with only a latch to fasten\nit, next the roof; one of those attics whose extremity forms an angle\nwith the floor, and knocks you on the head every instant. The poor\noccupant can reach the end of his chamber as he can the end of his\ndestiny, only by bending over more and more.\n\nShe had no longer a bed; a rag which she called her coverlet, a mattress\non the floor, and a seatless chair still remained. A little rosebush\nwhich she had, had dried up, forgotten, in one corner. In the other\ncorner was a butter-pot to hold water, which froze in winter, and in\nwhich the various levels of the water remained long marked by these\ncircles of ice. She had lost her shame; she lost her coquetry. A final\nsign. She went out, with dirty caps. Whether from lack of time or from\nindifference, she no longer mended her linen. As the heels wore out,\nshe dragged her stockings down into her shoes. This was evident from the\nperpendicular wrinkles. She patched her bodice, which was old and worn\nout, with scraps of calico which tore at the slightest movement. The\npeople to whom she was indebted made \"scenes\" and gave her no peace.\nShe found them in the street, she found them again on her staircase. She\npassed many a night weeping and thinking. Her eyes were very bright,\nand she felt a steady pain in her shoulder towards the top of the\nleft shoulder-blade. She coughed a great deal. She deeply hated Father\nMadeleine, but made no complaint. She sewed seventeen hours a day; but\na contractor for the work of prisons, who made the prisoners work at a\ndiscount, suddenly made prices fall, which reduced the daily earnings\nof working-women to nine sous. Seventeen hours of toil, and nine sous a\nday! Her creditors were more pitiless than ever. The second-hand dealer,\nwho had taken back nearly all his furniture, said to her incessantly,\n\"When will you pay me, you hussy?\" What did they want of her, good God!\nShe felt that she was being hunted, and something of the wild beast\ndeveloped in her. About the same time, Thenardier wrote to her that he\nhad waited with decidedly too much amiability and that he must have a\nhundred francs at once; otherwise he would turn little Cosette out of\ndoors, convalescent as she was from her heavy illness, into the cold and\nthe streets, and that she might do what she liked with herself, and die\nif she chose. \"A hundred francs,\" thought Fantine. \"But in what trade\ncan one earn a hundred sous a day?\"\n\n\"Come!\" said she, \"let us sell what is left.\"\n\nThe unfortunate girl became a woman of the town.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI--CHRISTUS NOS LIBERAVIT\n\nWhat is this history of Fantine? It is society purchasing a slave.\n\nFrom whom? From misery.\n\nFrom hunger, cold, isolation, destitution. A dolorous bargain. A soul\nfor a morsel of bread. Misery offers; society accepts.\n\nThe sacred law of Jesus Christ governs our civilization, but it does\nnot, as yet, permeate it; it is said that slavery has disappeared from\nEuropean civilization. This is a mistake. It still exists; but it weighs\nonly upon the woman, and it is called prostitution.\n\nIt weighs upon the woman, that is to say, upon grace, weakness, beauty,\nmaternity. This is not one of the least of man's disgraces.\n\nAt the point in this melancholy drama which we have now reached, nothing\nis left to Fantine of that which she had formerly been.\n\nShe has become marble in becoming mire. Whoever touches her feels cold.\nShe passes; she endures you; she ignores you; she is the severe and\ndishonored figure. Life and the social order have said their last word\nfor her. All has happened to her that will happen to her. She has\nfelt everything, borne everything, experienced everything, suffered\neverything, lost everything, mourned everything. She is resigned, with\nthat resignation which resembles indifference, as death resembles sleep.\nShe no longer avoids anything. Let all the clouds fall upon her, and all\nthe ocean sweep over her! What matters it to her? She is a sponge that\nis soaked.\n\nAt least, she believes it to be so; but it is an error to imagine that\nfate can be exhausted, and that one has reached the bottom of anything\nwhatever.\n\nAlas! What are all these fates, driven on pell-mell? Whither are they\ngoing? Why are they thus?\n\nHe who knows that sees the whole of the shadow.\n\nHe is alone. His name is God.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII--M. BAMATABOIS'S INACTIVITY\n\nThere is in all small towns, and there was at M. sur M. in particular,\na class of young men who nibble away an income of fifteen hundred\nfrancs with the same air with which their prototypes devour two hundred\nthousand francs a year in Paris. These are beings of the great neuter\nspecies: impotent men, parasites, cyphers, who have a little land, a\nlittle folly, a little wit; who would be rustics in a drawing-room, and\nwho think themselves gentlemen in the dram-shop; who say, \"My fields,\nmy peasants, my woods\"; who hiss actresses at the theatre to prove that\nthey are persons of taste; quarrel with the officers of the garrison\nto prove that they are men of war; hunt, smoke, yawn, drink, smell of\ntobacco, play billiards, stare at travellers as they descend from the\ndiligence, live at the cafe, dine at the inn, have a dog which eats the\nbones under the table, and a mistress who eats the dishes on the table;\nwho stick at a sou, exaggerate the fashions, admire tragedy, despise\nwomen, wear out their old boots, copy London through Paris, and Paris\nthrough the medium of Pont-A-Mousson, grow old as dullards, never work,\nserve no use, and do no great harm.\n\nM. Felix Tholomyes, had he remained in his own province and never beheld\nParis, would have been one of these men.\n\nIf they were richer, one would say, \"They are dandies;\" if they were\npoorer, one would say, \"They are idlers.\" They are simply men without\nemployment. Among these unemployed there are bores, the bored, dreamers,\nand some knaves.\n\nAt that period a dandy was composed of a tall collar, a big cravat, a\nwatch with trinkets, three vests of different colors, worn one on top of\nthe other--the red and blue inside; of a short-waisted olive coat, with\na codfish tail, a double row of silver buttons set close to each other\nand running up to the shoulder; and a pair of trousers of a lighter\nshade of olive, ornamented on the two seams with an indefinite, but\nalways uneven, number of lines, varying from one to eleven--a limit\nwhich was never exceeded. Add to this, high shoes with little irons\non the heels, a tall hat with a narrow brim, hair worn in a tuft, an\nenormous cane, and conversation set off by puns of Potier. Over all,\nspurs and a mustache. At that epoch mustaches indicated the bourgeois,\nand spurs the pedestrian.\n\nThe provincial dandy wore the longest of spurs and the fiercest of\nmustaches.\n\nIt was the period of the conflict of the republics of South America with\nthe King of Spain, of Bolivar against Morillo. Narrow-brimmed hats were\nroyalist, and were called morillos; liberals wore hats with wide brims,\nwhich were called bolivars.\n\nEight or ten months, then, after that which is related in the preceding\npages, towards the first of January, 1823, on a snowy evening, one of\nthese dandies, one of these unemployed, a \"right thinker,\" for he wore\na morillo, and was, moreover, warmly enveloped in one of those large\ncloaks which completed the fashionable costume in cold weather, was\namusing himself by tormenting a creature who was prowling about in a\nball-dress, with neck uncovered and flowers in her hair, in front of\nthe officers' cafe. This dandy was smoking, for he was decidedly\nfashionable.\n\nEach time that the woman passed in front of him, he bestowed on her,\ntogether with a puff from his cigar, some apostrophe which he considered\nwitty and mirthful, such as, \"How ugly you are!--Will you get out of my\nsight?--You have no teeth!\" etc., etc. This gentleman was known as M.\nBamatabois. The woman, a melancholy, decorated spectre which went and\ncame through the snow, made him no reply, did not even glance at him,\nand nevertheless continued her promenade in silence, and with a sombre\nregularity, which brought her every five minutes within reach of this\nsarcasm, like the condemned soldier who returns under the rods. The\nsmall effect which he produced no doubt piqued the lounger; and taking\nadvantage of a moment when her back was turned, he crept up behind her\nwith the gait of a wolf, and stifling his laugh, bent down, picked up a\nhandful of snow from the pavement, and thrust it abruptly into her back,\nbetween her bare shoulders. The woman uttered a roar, whirled round,\ngave a leap like a panther, and hurled herself upon the man, burying her\nnails in his face, with the most frightful words which could fall from\nthe guard-room into the gutter. These insults, poured forth in a voice\nroughened by brandy, did, indeed, proceed in hideous wise from a mouth\nwhich lacked its two front teeth. It was Fantine.\n\nAt the noise thus produced, the officers ran out in throngs from the\ncafe, passers-by collected, and a large and merry circle, hooting and\napplauding, was formed around this whirlwind composed of two beings,\nwhom there was some difficulty in recognizing as a man and a woman: the\nman struggling, his hat on the ground; the woman striking out with feet\nand fists, bareheaded, howling, minus hair and teeth, livid with wrath,\nhorrible.\n\nSuddenly a man of lofty stature emerged vivaciously from the crowd,\nseized the woman by her satin bodice, which was covered with mud, and\nsaid to her, \"Follow me!\"\n\nThe woman raised her head; her furious voice suddenly died away. Her\neyes were glassy; she turned pale instead of livid, and she trembled\nwith a quiver of terror. She had recognized Javert.\n\nThe dandy took advantage of the incident to make his escape.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII--THE SOLUTION OF SOME QUESTIONS CONNECTED WITH THE\nMUNICIPAL POLICE\n\nJavert thrust aside the spectators, broke the circle, and set out\nwith long strides towards the police station, which is situated at the\nextremity of the square, dragging the wretched woman after him. She\nyielded mechanically. Neither he nor she uttered a word. The cloud of\nspectators followed, jesting, in a paroxysm of delight. Supreme misery\nan occasion for obscenity.\n\nOn arriving at the police station, which was a low room, warmed by a\nstove, with a glazed and grated door opening on the street, and guarded\nby a detachment, Javert opened the door, entered with Fantine, and shut\nthe door behind him, to the great disappointment of the curious, who\nraised themselves on tiptoe, and craned their necks in front of the\nthick glass of the station-house, in their effort to see. Curiosity is a\nsort of gluttony. To see is to devour.\n\nOn entering, Fantine fell down in a corner, motionless and mute,\ncrouching down like a terrified dog.\n\nThe sergeant of the guard brought a lighted candle to the table. Javert\nseated himself, drew a sheet of stamped paper from his pocket, and began\nto write.\n\nThis class of women is consigned by our laws entirely to the discretion\nof the police. The latter do what they please, punish them, as seems\ngood to them, and confiscate at their will those two sorry things which\nthey entitle their industry and their liberty. Javert was impassive; his\ngrave face betrayed no emotion whatever. Nevertheless, he was seriously\nand deeply preoccupied. It was one of those moments when he was\nexercising without control, but subject to all the scruples of a severe\nconscience, his redoubtable discretionary power. At that moment he was\nconscious that his police agent's stool was a tribunal. He was entering\njudgment. He judged and condemned. He summoned all the ideas which could\npossibly exist in his mind, around the great thing which he was doing.\nThe more he examined the deed of this woman, the more shocked he felt.\nIt was evident that he had just witnessed the commission of a crime.\nHe had just beheld, yonder, in the street, society, in the person of a\nfreeholder and an elector, insulted and attacked by a creature who was\noutside all pales. A prostitute had made an attempt on the life of a\ncitizen. He had seen that, he, Javert. He wrote in silence.\n\nWhen he had finished he signed the paper, folded it, and said to the\nsergeant of the guard, as he handed it to him, \"Take three men and\nconduct this creature to jail.\"\n\nThen, turning to Fantine, \"You are to have six months of it.\" The\nunhappy woman shuddered.\n\n\"Six months! six months of prison!\" she exclaimed. \"Six months in which\nto earn seven sous a day! But what will become of Cosette? My daughter!\nmy daughter! But I still owe the Thenardiers over a hundred francs; do\nyou know that, Monsieur Inspector?\"\n\nShe dragged herself across the damp floor, among the muddy boots of all\nthose men, without rising, with clasped hands, and taking great strides\non her knees.\n\n\"Monsieur Javert,\" said she, \"I beseech your mercy. I assure you that\nI was not in the wrong. If you had seen the beginning, you would have\nseen. I swear to you by the good God that I was not to blame! That\ngentleman, the bourgeois, whom I do not know, put snow in my back. Has\nany one the right to put snow down our backs when we are walking along\npeaceably, and doing no harm to any one? I am rather ill, as you see.\nAnd then, he had been saying impertinent things to me for a long time:\n'You are ugly! you have no teeth!' I know well that I have no longer\nthose teeth. I did nothing; I said to myself, 'The gentleman is amusing\nhimself.' I was honest with him; I did not speak to him. It was at that\nmoment that he put the snow down my back. Monsieur Javert, good Monsieur\nInspector! is there not some person here who saw it and can tell you\nthat this is quite true? Perhaps I did wrong to get angry. You know that\none is not master of one's self at the first moment. One gives way to\nvivacity; and then, when some one puts something cold down your\nback just when you are not expecting it! I did wrong to spoil that\ngentleman's hat. Why did he go away? I would ask his pardon. Oh, my God!\nIt makes no difference to me whether I ask his pardon. Do me the favor\nto-day, for this once, Monsieur Javert. Hold! you do not know that in\nprison one can earn only seven sous a day; it is not the government's\nfault, but seven sous is one's earnings; and just fancy, I must pay\none hundred francs, or my little girl will be sent to me. Oh, my God!\nI cannot have her with me. What I do is so vile! Oh, my Cosette! Oh, my\nlittle angel of the Holy Virgin! what will become of her, poor creature?\nI will tell you: it is the Thenardiers, inn-keepers, peasants; and such\npeople are unreasonable. They want money. Don't put me in prison! You\nsee, there is a little girl who will be turned out into the street to\nget along as best she may, in the very heart of the winter; and you must\nhave pity on such a being, my good Monsieur Javert. If she were older,\nshe might earn her living; but it cannot be done at that age. I am not a\nbad woman at bottom. It is not cowardliness and gluttony that have made\nme what I am. If I have drunk brandy, it was out of misery. I do not\nlove it; but it benumbs the senses. When I was happy, it was only\nnecessary to glance into my closets, and it would have been evident that\nI was not a coquettish and untidy woman. I had linen, a great deal of\nlinen. Have pity on me, Monsieur Javert!\"\n\nShe spoke thus, rent in twain, shaken with sobs, blinded with tears,\nher neck bare, wringing her hands, and coughing with a dry, short cough,\nstammering softly with a voice of agony. Great sorrow is a divine and\nterrible ray, which transfigures the unhappy. At that moment Fantine had\nbecome beautiful once more. From time to time she paused, and tenderly\nkissed the police agent's coat. She would have softened a heart of\ngranite; but a heart of wood cannot be softened.\n\n\"Come!\" said Javert, \"I have heard you out. Have you entirely finished?\nYou will get six months. Now march! The Eternal Father in person could\ndo nothing more.\"\n\nAt these solemn words, \"the Eternal Father in person could do nothing\nmore,\" she understood that her fate was sealed. She sank down,\nmurmuring, \"Mercy!\"\n\nJavert turned his back.\n\nThe soldiers seized her by the arms.\n\nA few moments earlier a man had entered, but no one had paid any heed\nto him. He shut the door, leaned his back against it, and listened to\nFantine's despairing supplications.\n\nAt the instant when the soldiers laid their hands upon the unfortunate\nwoman, who would not rise, he emerged from the shadow, and said:--\n\n\"One moment, if you please.\"\n\nJavert raised his eyes and recognized M. Madeleine. He removed his hat,\nand, saluting him with a sort of aggrieved awkwardness:--\n\n\"Excuse me, Mr. Mayor--\"\n\nThe words \"Mr. Mayor\" produced a curious effect upon Fantine. She rose\nto her feet with one bound, like a spectre springing from the earth,\nthrust aside the soldiers with both arms, walked straight up to M.\nMadeleine before any one could prevent her, and gazing intently at him,\nwith a bewildered air, she cried:--\n\n\"Ah! so it is you who are M. le Maire!\"\n\nThen she burst into a laugh, and spit in his face.\n\nM. Madeleine wiped his face, and said:--\n\n\"Inspector Javert, set this woman at liberty.\"\n\nJavert felt that he was on the verge of going mad. He experienced at\nthat moment, blow upon blow and almost simultaneously, the most violent\nemotions which he had ever undergone in all his life. To see a woman of\nthe town spit in the mayor's face was a thing so monstrous that, in his\nmost daring flights of fancy, he would have regarded it as a sacrilege\nto believe it possible. On the other hand, at the very bottom of his\nthought, he made a hideous comparison as to what this woman was, and as\nto what this mayor might be; and then he, with horror, caught a glimpse\nof I know not what simple explanation of this prodigious attack. But\nwhen he beheld that mayor, that magistrate, calmly wipe his face and\nsay, \"Set this woman at liberty,\" he underwent a sort of intoxication\nof amazement; thought and word failed him equally; the sum total of\npossible astonishment had been exceeded in his case. He remained mute.\n\nThe words had produced no less strange an effect on Fantine. She raised\nher bare arm, and clung to the damper of the stove, like a person who\nis reeling. Nevertheless, she glanced about her, and began to speak in a\nlow voice, as though talking to herself:--\n\n\"At liberty! I am to be allowed to go! I am not to go to prison for six\nmonths! Who said that? It is not possible that any one could have said\nthat. I did not hear aright. It cannot have been that monster of a\nmayor! Was it you, my good Monsieur Javert, who said that I was to be\nset free? Oh, see here! I will tell you about it, and you will let me\ngo. That monster of a mayor, that old blackguard of a mayor, is the\ncause of all. Just imagine, Monsieur Javert, he turned me out! all\nbecause of a pack of rascally women, who gossip in the workroom. If that\nis not a horror, what is? To dismiss a poor girl who is doing her\nwork honestly! Then I could no longer earn enough, and all this misery\nfollowed. In the first place, there is one improvement which these\ngentlemen of the police ought to make, and that is, to prevent prison\ncontractors from wronging poor people. I will explain it to you, you\nsee: you are earning twelve sous at shirt-making, the price falls to\nnine sous; and it is not enough to live on. Then one has to become\nwhatever one can. As for me, I had my little Cosette, and I was actually\nforced to become a bad woman. Now you understand how it is that that\nblackguard of a mayor caused all the mischief. After that I stamped on\nthat gentleman's hat in front of the officers' cafe; but he had spoiled\nmy whole dress with snow. We women have but one silk dress for evening\nwear. You see that I did not do wrong deliberately--truly, Monsieur\nJavert; and everywhere I behold women who are far more wicked than I,\nand who are much happier. O Monsieur Javert! it was you who gave orders\nthat I am to be set free, was it not? Make inquiries, speak to my\nlandlord; I am paying my rent now; they will tell you that I am\nperfectly honest. Ah! my God! I beg your pardon; I have unintentionally\ntouched the damper of the stove, and it has made it smoke.\"\n\nM. Madeleine listened to her with profound attention. While she was\nspeaking, he fumbled in his waistcoat, drew out his purse and opened\nit. It was empty. He put it back in his pocket. He said to Fantine, \"How\nmuch did you say that you owed?\"\n\nFantine, who was looking at Javert only, turned towards him:--\n\n\"Was I speaking to you?\"\n\nThen, addressing the soldiers:--\n\n\"Say, you fellows, did you see how I spit in his face? Ah! you old\nwretch of a mayor, you came here to frighten me, but I'm not afraid of\nyou. I am afraid of Monsieur Javert. I am afraid of my good Monsieur\nJavert!\"\n\nSo saying, she turned to the inspector again:--\n\n\"And yet, you see, Mr. Inspector, it is necessary to be just. I\nunderstand that you are just, Mr. Inspector; in fact, it is perfectly\nsimple: a man amuses himself by putting snow down a woman's back, and\nthat makes the officers laugh; one must divert themselves in some way;\nand we--well, we are here for them to amuse themselves with, of course!\nAnd then, you, you come; you are certainly obliged to preserve order,\nyou lead off the woman who is in the wrong; but on reflection, since you\nare a good man, you say that I am to be set at liberty; it is for\nthe sake of the little one, for six months in prison would prevent my\nsupporting my child. 'Only, don't do it again, you hussy!' Oh! I won't\ndo it again, Monsieur Javert! They may do whatever they please to me\nnow; I will not stir. But to-day, you see, I cried because it hurt me.\nI was not expecting that snow from the gentleman at all; and then as I\ntold you, I am not well; I have a cough; I seem to have a burning ball\nin my stomach, and the doctor tells me, 'Take care of yourself.' Here,\nfeel, give me your hand; don't be afraid--it is here.\"\n\nShe no longer wept, her voice was caressing; she placed Javert's coarse\nhand on her delicate, white throat and looked smilingly at him.\n\nAll at once she rapidly adjusted her disordered garments, dropped the\nfolds of her skirt, which had been pushed up as she dragged herself\nalong, almost to the height of her knee, and stepped towards the door,\nsaying to the soldiers in a low voice, and with a friendly nod:--\n\n\"Children, Monsieur l'Inspecteur has said that I am to be released, and\nI am going.\"\n\nShe laid her hand on the latch of the door. One step more and she would\nbe in the street.\n\nJavert up to that moment had remained erect, motionless, with his eyes\nfixed on the ground, cast athwart this scene like some displaced statue,\nwhich is waiting to be put away somewhere.\n\nThe sound of the latch roused him. He raised his head with an expression\nof sovereign authority, an expression all the more alarming in\nproportion as the authority rests on a low level, ferocious in the wild\nbeast, atrocious in the man of no estate.\n\n\"Sergeant!\" he cried, \"don't you see that that jade is walking off! Who\nbade you let her go?\"\n\n\"I,\" said Madeleine.\n\nFantine trembled at the sound of Javert's voice, and let go of the latch\nas a thief relinquishes the article which he has stolen. At the sound\nof Madeleine's voice she turned around, and from that moment forth she\nuttered no word, nor dared so much as to breathe freely, but her glance\nstrayed from Madeleine to Javert, and from Javert to Madeleine in turn,\naccording to which was speaking.\n\nIt was evident that Javert must have been exasperated beyond measure\nbefore he would permit himself to apostrophize the sergeant as he\nhad done, after the mayor's suggestion that Fantine should be set at\nliberty. Had he reached the point of forgetting the mayor's presence?\nHad he finally declared to himself that it was impossible that any\n\"authority\" should have given such an order, and that the mayor must\ncertainly have said one thing by mistake for another, without intending\nit? Or, in view of the enormities of which he had been a witness for the\npast two hours, did he say to himself, that it was necessary to recur to\nsupreme resolutions, that it was indispensable that the small should\nbe made great, that the police spy should transform himself into a\nmagistrate, that the policeman should become a dispenser of justice, and\nthat, in this prodigious extremity, order, law, morality, government,\nsociety in its entirety, was personified in him, Javert?\n\nHowever that may be, when M. Madeleine uttered that word, _I_, as we\nhave just heard, Police Inspector Javert was seen to turn toward the\nmayor, pale, cold, with blue lips, and a look of despair, his whole body\nagitated by an imperceptible quiver and an unprecedented occurrence, and\nsay to him, with downcast eyes but a firm voice:--\n\n\"Mr. Mayor, that cannot be.\"\n\n\"Why not?\" said M. Madeleine.\n\n\"This miserable woman has insulted a citizen.\"\n\n\"Inspector Javert,\" replied the mayor, in a calm and conciliating tone,\n\"listen. You are an honest man, and I feel no hesitation in explaining\nmatters to you. Here is the true state of the case: I was passing\nthrough the square just as you were leading this woman away; there were\nstill groups of people standing about, and I made inquiries and learned\neverything; it was the townsman who was in the wrong and who should have\nbeen arrested by properly conducted police.\"\n\nJavert retorted:--\n\n\"This wretch has just insulted Monsieur le Maire.\"\n\n\"That concerns me,\" said M. Madeleine. \"My own insult belongs to me, I\nthink. I can do what I please about it.\"\n\n\"I beg Monsieur le Maire's pardon. The insult is not to him but to the\nlaw.\"\n\n\"Inspector Javert,\" replied M. Madeleine, \"the highest law is\nconscience. I have heard this woman; I know what I am doing.\"\n\n\"And I, Mr. Mayor, do not know what I see.\"\n\n\"Then content yourself with obeying.\"\n\n\"I am obeying my duty. My duty demands that this woman shall serve six\nmonths in prison.\"\n\nM. Madeleine replied gently:--\n\n\"Heed this well; she will not serve a single day.\"\n\nAt this decisive word, Javert ventured to fix a searching look on the\nmayor and to say, but in a tone of voice that was still profoundly\nrespectful:--\n\n\"I am sorry to oppose Monsieur le Maire; it is for the first time in my\nlife, but he will permit me to remark that I am within the bounds of my\nauthority. I confine myself, since Monsieur le Maire desires it, to the\nquestion of the gentleman. I was present. This woman flung herself\non Monsieur Bamatabnois, who is an elector and the proprietor of that\nhandsome house with a balcony, which forms the corner of the esplanade,\nthree stories high and entirely of cut stone. Such things as there are\nin the world! In any case, Monsieur le Maire, this is a question of\npolice regulations in the streets, and concerns me, and I shall detain\nthis woman Fantine.\"\n\nThen M. Madeleine folded his arms, and said in a severe voice which no\none in the town had heard hitherto:--\n\n\"The matter to which you refer is one connected with the municipal\npolice. According to the terms of articles nine, eleven, fifteen, and\nsixty-six of the code of criminal examination, I am the judge. I order\nthat this woman shall be set at liberty.\"\n\nJavert ventured to make a final effort.\n\n\"But, Mr. Mayor--\"\n\n\"I refer you to article eighty-one of the law of the 13th of December,\n1799, in regard to arbitrary detention.\"\n\n\"Monsieur le Maire, permit me--\"\n\n\"Not another word.\"\n\n\"But--\"\n\n\"Leave the room,\" said M. Madeleine.\n\nJavert received the blow erect, full in the face, in his breast, like\na Russian soldier. He bowed to the very earth before the mayor and left\nthe room.\n\nFantine stood aside from the door and stared at him in amazement as he\npassed.\n\nNevertheless, she also was the prey to a strange confusion. She had just\nseen herself a subject of dispute between two opposing powers. She had\nseen two men who held in their hands her liberty, her life, her soul,\nher child, in combat before her very eyes; one of these men was drawing\nher towards darkness, the other was leading her back towards the light.\nIn this conflict, viewed through the exaggerations of terror, these two\nmen had appeared to her like two giants; the one spoke like her demon,\nthe other like her good angel. The angel had conquered the demon, and,\nstrange to say, that which made her shudder from head to foot was\nthe fact that this angel, this liberator, was the very man whom she\nabhorred, that mayor whom she had so long regarded as the author of all\nher woes, that Madeleine! And at the very moment when she had insulted\nhim in so hideous a fashion, he had saved her! Had she, then, been\nmistaken? Must she change her whole soul? She did not know; she\ntrembled. She listened in bewilderment, she looked on in affright, and\nat every word uttered by M. Madeleine she felt the frightful shades of\nhatred crumble and melt within her, and something warm and ineffable,\nindescribable, which was both joy, confidence and love, dawn in her\nheart.\n\nWhen Javert had taken his departure, M. Madeleine turned to her and said\nto her in a deliberate voice, like a serious man who does not wish to\nweep and who finds some difficulty in speaking:--\n\n\"I have heard you. I knew nothing about what you have mentioned. I\nbelieve that it is true, and I feel that it is true. I was even ignorant\nof the fact that you had left my shop. Why did you not apply to me? But\nhere; I will pay your debts, I will send for your child, or you shall go\nto her. You shall live here, in Paris, or where you please. I undertake\nthe care of your child and yourself. You shall not work any longer if\nyou do not like. I will give all the money you require. You shall be\nhonest and happy once more. And listen! I declare to you that if all\nis as you say,--and I do not doubt it,--you have never ceased to be\nvirtuous and holy in the sight of God. Oh! poor woman.\"\n\nThis was more than Fantine could bear. To have Cosette! To leave this\nlife of infamy. To live free, rich, happy, respectable with Cosette; to\nsee all these realities of paradise blossom of a sudden in the midst of\nher misery. She stared stupidly at this man who was talking to her, and\ncould only give vent to two or three sobs, \"Oh! Oh! Oh!\"\n\nHer limbs gave way beneath her, she knelt in front of M. Madeleine, and\nbefore he could prevent her he felt her grasp his hand and press her\nlips to it.\n\nThen she fainted.\n\n\n\n\nBOOK SIXTH.--JAVERT\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I--THE BEGINNING OF REPOSE\n\n\nM. Madeleine had Fantine removed to that infirmary which he had\nestablished in his own house. He confided her to the sisters, who put\nher to bed. A burning fever had come on. She passed a part of the night\nin delirium and raving. At length, however, she fell asleep.\n\nOn the morrow, towards midday, Fantine awoke. She heard some one\nbreathing close to her bed; she drew aside the curtain and saw M.\nMadeleine standing there and looking at something over her head. His\ngaze was full of pity, anguish, and supplication. She followed its\ndirection, and saw that it was fixed on a crucifix which was nailed to\nthe wall.\n\nThenceforth, M. Madeleine was transfigured in Fantine's eyes. He seemed\nto her to be clothed in light. He was absorbed in a sort of prayer. She\ngazed at him for a long time without daring to interrupt him. At last\nshe said timidly:--\n\n\"What are you doing?\"\n\nM. Madeleine had been there for an hour. He had been waiting for Fantine\nto awake. He took her hand, felt of her pulse, and replied:--\n\n\"How do you feel?\"\n\n\"Well, I have slept,\" she replied; \"I think that I am better, It is\nnothing.\"\n\nHe answered, responding to the first question which she had put to him\nas though he had just heard it:--\n\n\"I was praying to the martyr there on high.\"\n\nAnd he added in his own mind, \"For the martyr here below.\"\n\nM. Madeleine had passed the night and the morning in making inquiries.\nHe knew all now. He knew Fantine's history in all its heart-rending\ndetails. He went on:--\n\n\"You have suffered much, poor mother. Oh! do not complain; you now have\nthe dowry of the elect. It is thus that men are transformed into angels.\nIt is not their fault they do not know how to go to work otherwise.\nYou see this hell from which you have just emerged is the first form of\nheaven. It was necessary to begin there.\"\n\nHe sighed deeply. But she smiled on him with that sublime smile in which\ntwo teeth were lacking.\n\nThat same night, Javert wrote a letter. The next morning be posted it\nhimself at the office of M. sur M. It was addressed to Paris, and the\nsuperscription ran: To Monsieur Chabouillet, Secretary of Monsieur le\nPrefet of Police. As the affair in the station-house had been bruited\nabout, the post-mistress and some other persons who saw the letter\nbefore it was sent off, and who recognized Javert's handwriting on the\ncover, thought that he was sending in his resignation.\n\nM. Madeleine made haste to write to the Thenardiers. Fantine owed\nthem one hundred and twenty francs. He sent them three hundred francs,\ntelling them to pay themselves from that sum, and to fetch the child\ninstantly to M. sur M., where her sick mother required her presence.\n\nThis dazzled Thenardier. \"The devil!\" said the man to his wife; \"don't\nlet's allow the child to go. This lark is going to turn into a milch\ncow. I see through it. Some ninny has taken a fancy to the mother.\"\n\nHe replied with a very well drawn-up bill for five hundred and some odd\nfrancs. In this memorandum two indisputable items figured up over three\nhundred francs,--one for the doctor, the other for the apothecary\nwho had attended and physicked Eponine and Azelma through two long\nillnesses. Cosette, as we have already said, had not been ill. It was\nonly a question of a trifling substitution of names. At the foot of the\nmemorandum Thenardier wrote, Received on account, three hundred francs.\n\nM. Madeleine immediately sent three hundred francs more, and wrote,\n\"Make haste to bring Cosette.\"\n\n\"Christi!\" said Thenardier, \"let's not give up the child.\"\n\nIn the meantime, Fantine did not recover. She still remained in the\ninfirmary.\n\nThe sisters had at first only received and nursed \"that woman\" with\nrepugnance. Those who have seen the bas-reliefs of Rheims will recall\nthe inflation of the lower lip of the wise virgins as they survey the\nfoolish virgins. The ancient scorn of the vestals for the ambubajae is\none of the most profound instincts of feminine dignity; the sisters\nfelt it with the double force contributed by religion. But in a few days\nFantine disarmed them. She said all kinds of humble and gentle things,\nand the mother in her provoked tenderness. One day the sisters heard\nher say amid her fever: \"I have been a sinner; but when I have my child\nbeside me, it will be a sign that God has pardoned me. While I was\nleading a bad life, I should not have liked to have my Cosette with me;\nI could not have borne her sad, astonished eyes. It was for her sake\nthat I did evil, and that is why God pardons me. I shall feel the\nbenediction of the good God when Cosette is here. I shall gaze at her;\nit will do me good to see that innocent creature. She knows nothing at\nall. She is an angel, you see, my sisters. At that age the wings have\nnot fallen off.\"\n\nM. Madeleine went to see her twice a day, and each time she asked him:--\n\n\"Shall I see my Cosette soon?\"\n\nHe answered:--\n\n\"To-morrow, perhaps. She may arrive at any moment. I am expecting her.\"\n\nAnd the mother's pale face grew radiant.\n\n\"Oh!\" she said, \"how happy I am going to be!\"\n\nWe have just said that she did not recover her health. On the contrary,\nher condition seemed to become more grave from week to week. That\nhandful of snow applied to her bare skin between her shoulder-blades had\nbrought about a sudden suppression of perspiration, as a consequence of\nwhich the malady which had been smouldering within her for many years\nwas violently developed at last. At that time people were beginning to\nfollow the fine Laennec's fine suggestions in the study and treatment of\nchest maladies. The doctor sounded Fantine's chest and shook his head.\n\nM. Madeleine said to the doctor:--\n\n\"Well?\"\n\n\"Has she not a child which she desires to see?\" said the doctor.\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Well! Make haste and get it here!\"\n\nM. Madeleine shuddered.\n\nFantine inquired:--\n\n\"What did the doctor say?\"\n\nM. Madeleine forced himself to smile.\n\n\"He said that your child was to be brought speedily. That that would\nrestore your health.\"\n\n\"Oh!\" she rejoined, \"he is right! But what do those Thenardiers mean\nby keeping my Cosette from me! Oh! she is coming. At last I behold\nhappiness close beside me!\"\n\nIn the meantime Thenardier did not \"let go of the child,\" and gave a\nhundred insufficient reasons for it. Cosette was not quite well enough\nto take a journey in the winter. And then, there still remained some\npetty but pressing debts in the neighborhood, and they were collecting\nthe bills for them, etc., etc.\n\n\"I shall send some one to fetch Cosette!\" said Father Madeleine. \"If\nnecessary, I will go myself.\"\n\nHe wrote the following letter to Fantine's dictation, and made her sign\nit:--\n\n \"MONSIEUR THENARDIER:--\n          You will deliver Cosette to this person.\n          You will be paid for all the little things.\n          I have the honor to salute you with respect.\n                                                  \"FANTINE.\"\n\n\nIn the meantime a serious incident occurred. Carve as we will the\nmysterious block of which our life is made, the black vein of destiny\nconstantly reappears in it.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II--HOW JEAN MAY BECOME CHAMP\n\n\nOne morning M. Madeleine was in his study, occupied in arranging in\nadvance some pressing matters connected with the mayor's office, in case\nhe should decide to take the trip to Montfermeil, when he was informed\nthat Police Inspector Javert was desirous of speaking with him.\nMadeleine could not refrain from a disagreeable impression on hearing\nthis name. Javert had avoided him more than ever since the affair of the\npolice-station, and M. Madeleine had not seen him.\n\n\"Admit him,\" he said.\n\nJavert entered.\n\nM. Madeleine had retained his seat near the fire, pen in hand, his eyes\nfixed on the docket which he was turning over and annotating, and which\ncontained the trials of the commission on highways for the infraction of\npolice regulations. He did not disturb himself on Javert's account. He\ncould not help thinking of poor Fantine, and it suited him to be glacial\nin his manner.\n\nJavert bestowed a respectful salute on the mayor, whose back was turned\nto him. The mayor did not look at him, but went on annotating this\ndocket.\n\nJavert advanced two or three paces into the study, and halted, without\nbreaking the silence.\n\nIf any physiognomist who had been familiar with Javert, and who had\nmade a lengthy study of this savage in the service of civilization,\nthis singular composite of the Roman, the Spartan, the monk, and the\ncorporal, this spy who was incapable of a lie, this unspotted police\nagent--if any physiognomist had known his secret and long-cherished\naversion for M. Madeleine, his conflict with the mayor on the subject of\nFantine, and had examined Javert at that moment, he would have said to\nhimself, \"What has taken place?\" It was evident to any one acquainted\nwith that clear, upright, sincere, honest, austere, and ferocious\nconscience, that Javert had but just gone through some great interior\nstruggle. Javert had nothing in his soul which he had not also in his\ncountenance. Like violent people in general, he was subject to abrupt\nchanges of opinion. His physiognomy had never been more peculiar and\nstartling. On entering he bowed to M. Madeleine with a look in which\nthere was neither rancor, anger, nor distrust; he halted a few paces in\nthe rear of the mayor's arm-chair, and there he stood, perfectly erect,\nin an attitude almost of discipline, with the cold, ingenuous roughness\nof a man who has never been gentle and who has always been patient; he\nwaited without uttering a word, without making a movement, in genuine\nhumility and tranquil resignation, calm, serious, hat in hand, with\neyes cast down, and an expression which was half-way between that of a\nsoldier in the presence of his officer and a criminal in the presence\nof his judge, until it should please the mayor to turn round. All the\nsentiments as well as all the memories which one might have attributed\nto him had disappeared. That face, as impenetrable and simple as\ngranite, no longer bore any trace of anything but a melancholy\ndepression. His whole person breathed lowliness and firmness and an\nindescribable courageous despondency.\n\nAt last the mayor laid down his pen and turned half round.\n\n\"Well! What is it? What is the matter, Javert?\"\n\nJavert remained silent for an instant as though collecting his ideas,\nthen raised his voice with a sort of sad solemnity, which did not,\nhowever, preclude simplicity.\n\n\"This is the matter, Mr. Mayor; a culpable act has been committed.\"\n\n\"What act?\"\n\n\"An inferior agent of the authorities has failed in respect, and in the\ngravest manner, towards a magistrate. I have come to bring the fact to\nyour knowledge, as it is my duty to do.\"\n\n\"Who is the agent?\" asked M. Madeleine.\n\n\"I,\" said Javert.\n\n\"You?\"\n\n\"I.\"\n\n\"And who is the magistrate who has reason to complain of the agent?\"\n\n\"You, Mr. Mayor.\"\n\nM. Madeleine sat erect in his arm-chair. Javert went on, with a severe\nair and his eyes still cast down.\n\n\"Mr. Mayor, I have come to request you to instigate the authorities to\ndismiss me.\"\n\nM. Madeleine opened his mouth in amazement. Javert interrupted him:--\n\n\"You will say that I might have handed in my resignation, but that does\nnot suffice. Handing in one's resignation is honorable. I have failed in\nmy duty; I ought to be punished; I must be turned out.\"\n\nAnd after a pause he added:--\n\n\"Mr. Mayor, you were severe with me the other day, and unjustly. Be so\nto-day, with justice.\"\n\n\"Come, now! Why?\" exclaimed M. Madeleine. \"What nonsense is this?\nWhat is the meaning of this? What culpable act have you been guilty of\ntowards me? What have you done to me? What are your wrongs with regard\nto me? You accuse yourself; you wish to be superseded--\"\n\n\"Turned out,\" said Javert.\n\n\"Turned out; so it be, then. That is well. I do not understand.\"\n\n\"You shall understand, Mr. Mayor.\"\n\nJavert sighed from the very bottom of his chest, and resumed, still\ncoldly and sadly:--\n\n\"Mr. Mayor, six weeks ago, in consequence of the scene over that woman,\nI was furious, and I informed against you.\"\n\n\"Informed against me!\"\n\n\"At the Prefecture of Police in Paris.\"\n\nM. Madeleine, who was not in the habit of laughing much oftener than\nJavert himself, burst out laughing now:--\n\n\"As a mayor who had encroached on the province of the police?\"\n\n\"As an ex-convict.\"\n\nThe mayor turned livid.\n\nJavert, who had not raised his eyes, went on:--\n\n\"I thought it was so. I had had an idea for a long time; a resemblance;\ninquiries which you had caused to be made at Faverolles; the strength\nof your loins; the adventure with old Fauchelevant; your skill in\nmarksmanship; your leg, which you drag a little;--I hardly know what\nall,--absurdities! But, at all events, I took you for a certain Jean\nValjean.\"\n\n\"A certain--What did you say the name was?\"\n\n\"Jean Valjean. He was a convict whom I was in the habit of seeing twenty\nyears ago, when I was adjutant-guard of convicts at Toulon. On leaving\nthe galleys, this Jean Valjean, as it appears, robbed a bishop; then he\ncommitted another theft, accompanied with violence, on a public highway\non the person of a little Savoyard. He disappeared eight years ago, no\none knows how, and he has been sought, I fancied. In short, I did this\nthing! Wrath impelled me; I denounced you at the Prefecture!\"\n\nM. Madeleine, who had taken up the docket again several moments before\nthis, resumed with an air of perfect indifference:--\n\n\"And what reply did you receive?\"\n\n\"That I was mad.\"\n\n\"Well?\"\n\n\"Well, they were right.\"\n\n\"It is lucky that you recognize the fact.\"\n\n\"I am forced to do so, since the real Jean Valjean has been found.\"\n\nThe sheet of paper which M. Madeleine was holding dropped from his\nhand; he raised his head, gazed fixedly at Javert, and said with his\nindescribable accent:--\n\n\"Ah!\"\n\nJavert continued:--\n\n\"This is the way it is, Mr. Mayor. It seems that there was in the\nneighborhood near Ailly-le-Haut-Clocher an old fellow who was called\nFather Champmathieu. He was a very wretched creature. No one paid any\nattention to him. No one knows what such people subsist on. Lately, last\nautumn, Father Champmathieu was arrested for the theft of some cider\napples from--Well, no matter, a theft had been committed, a wall scaled,\nbranches of trees broken. My Champmathieu was arrested. He still had\nthe branch of apple-tree in his hand. The scamp is locked up. Up to\nthis point it was merely an affair of a misdemeanor. But here is where\nProvidence intervened.\n\n\"The jail being in a bad condition, the examining magistrate finds it\nconvenient to transfer Champmathieu to Arras, where the departmental\nprison is situated. In this prison at Arras there is an ex-convict named\nBrevet, who is detained for I know not what, and who has been appointed\nturnkey of the house, because of good behavior. Mr. Mayor, no sooner had\nChampmathieu arrived than Brevet exclaims: 'Eh! Why, I know that man!\nHe is a fagot![4] Take a good look at me, my good man! You are Jean\nValjean!' 'Jean Valjean! who's Jean Valjean?' Champmathieu feigns\nastonishment. 'Don't play the innocent dodge,' says Brevet. 'You are\nJean Valjean! You have been in the galleys of Toulon; it was twenty\nyears ago; we were there together.' Champmathieu denies it. Parbleu! You\nunderstand. The case is investigated. The thing was well ventilated for\nme. This is what they discovered: This Champmathieu had been, thirty\nyears ago, a pruner of trees in various localities, notably at\nFaverolles. There all trace of him was lost. A long time afterwards he\nwas seen again in Auvergne; then in Paris, where he is said to have been\na wheelwright, and to have had a daughter, who was a laundress; but that\nhas not been proved. Now, before going to the galleys for theft, what\nwas Jean Valjean? A pruner of trees. Where? At Faverolles. Another fact.\nThis Valjean's Christian name was Jean, and his mother's surname was\nMathieu. What more natural to suppose than that, on emerging from the\ngalleys, he should have taken his mother's name for the purpose of\nconcealing himself, and have called himself Jean Mathieu? He goes to\nAuvergne. The local pronunciation turns Jean into Chan--he is called\nChan Mathieu. Our man offers no opposition, and behold him transformed\ninto Champmathieu. You follow me, do you not? Inquiries were made at\nFaverolles. The family of Jean Valjean is no longer there. It is not\nknown where they have gone. You know that among those classes a family\noften disappears. Search was made, and nothing was found. When such\npeople are not mud, they are dust. And then, as the beginning of the\nstory dates thirty years back, there is no longer any one at Faverolles\nwho knew Jean Valjean. Inquiries were made at Toulon. Besides Brevet,\nthere are only two convicts in existence who have seen Jean Valjean;\nthey are Cochepaille and Chenildieu, and are sentenced for life.\nThey are taken from the galleys and confronted with the pretended\nChampmathieu. They do not hesitate; he is Jean Valjean for them as well\nas for Brevet. The same age,--he is fifty-four,--the same height, the\nsame air, the same man; in short, it is he. It was precisely at this\nmoment that I forwarded my denunciation to the Prefecture in Paris. I\nwas told that I had lost my reason, and that Jean Valjean is at Arras,\nin the power of the authorities. You can imagine whether this surprised\nme, when I thought that I had that same Jean Valjean here. I write to\nthe examining judge; he sends for me; Champmathieu is conducted to me--\"\n\n\"Well?\" interposed M. Madeleine.\n\nJavert replied, his face incorruptible, and as melancholy as ever:--\n\n\"Mr. Mayor, the truth is the truth. I am sorry; but that man is Jean\nValjean. I recognized him also.\"\n\nM. Madeleine resumed in, a very low voice:--\n\n\"You are sure?\"\n\nJavert began to laugh, with that mournful laugh which comes from\nprofound conviction.\n\n\"O! Sure!\"\n\nHe stood there thoughtfully for a moment, mechanically taking pinches of\npowdered wood for blotting ink from the wooden bowl which stood on the\ntable, and he added:--\n\n\"And even now that I have seen the real Jean Valjean, I do not see how I\ncould have thought otherwise. I beg your pardon, Mr. Mayor.\"\n\nJavert, as he addressed these grave and supplicating words to the man,\nwho six weeks before had humiliated him in the presence of the whole\nstation-house, and bade him \"leave the room,\"--Javert, that haughty man,\nwas unconsciously full of simplicity and dignity,--M. Madeleine made no\nother reply to his prayer than the abrupt question:--\n\n\"And what does this man say?\"\n\n\"Ah! Indeed, Mr. Mayor, it's a bad business. If he is Jean Valjean, he\nhas his previous conviction against him. To climb a wall, to break a\nbranch, to purloin apples, is a mischievous trick in a child; for a\nman it is a misdemeanor; for a convict it is a crime. Robbing\nand housebreaking--it is all there. It is no longer a question of\ncorrectional police; it is a matter for the Court of Assizes. It is no\nlonger a matter of a few days in prison; it is the galleys for life. And\nthen, there is the affair with the little Savoyard, who will return, I\nhope. The deuce! there is plenty to dispute in the matter, is there not?\nYes, for any one but Jean Valjean. But Jean Valjean is a sly dog. That\nis the way I recognized him. Any other man would have felt that things\nwere getting hot for him; he would struggle, he would cry out--the\nkettle sings before the fire; he would not be Jean Valjean, et\ncetera. But he has not the appearance of understanding; he says, 'I am\nChampmathieu, and I won't depart from that!' He has an astonished air,\nhe pretends to be stupid; it is far better. Oh! the rogue is clever! But\nit makes no difference. The proofs are there. He has been recognized by\nfour persons; the old scamp will be condemned. The case has been taken\nto the Assizes at Arras. I shall go there to give my testimony. I have\nbeen summoned.\"\n\nM. Madeleine had turned to his desk again, and taken up his docket, and\nwas turning over the leaves tranquilly, reading and writing by turns,\nlike a busy man. He turned to Javert:--\n\n\"That will do, Javert. In truth, all these details interest me but\nlittle. We are wasting our time, and we have pressing business on hand.\nJavert, you will betake yourself at once to the house of the woman\nBuseaupied, who sells herbs at the corner of the Rue Saint-Saulve. You\nwill tell her that she must enter her complaint against carter Pierre\nChesnelong. The man is a brute, who came near crushing this woman and\nher child. He must be punished. You will then go to M. Charcellay,\nRue Montre-de-Champigny. He complained that there is a gutter on the\nadjoining house which discharges rain-water on his premises, and is\nundermining the foundations of his house. After that, you will verify\nthe infractions of police regulations which have been reported to me in\nthe Rue Guibourg, at Widow Doris's, and Rue du Garraud-Blanc, at Madame\nRenee le Bosse's, and you will prepare documents. But I am giving you a\ngreat deal of work. Are you not to be absent? Did you not tell me that\nyou were going to Arras on that matter in a week or ten days?\"\n\n\"Sooner than that, Mr. Mayor.\"\n\n\"On what day, then?\"\n\n\"Why, I thought that I had said to Monsieur le Maire that the case was\nto be tried to-morrow, and that I am to set out by diligence to-night.\"\n\nM. Madeleine made an imperceptible movement.\n\n\"And how long will the case last?\"\n\n\"One day, at the most. The judgment will be pronounced to-morrow evening\nat latest. But I shall not wait for the sentence, which is certain; I\nshall return here as soon as my deposition has been taken.\"\n\n\"That is well,\" said M. Madeleine.\n\nAnd he dismissed Javert with a wave of the hand.\n\nJavert did not withdraw.\n\n\"Excuse me, Mr. Mayor,\" said he.\n\n\"What is it now?\" demanded M. Madeleine.\n\n\"Mr. Mayor, there is still something of which I must remind you.\"\n\n\"What is it?\"\n\n\"That I must be dismissed.\"\n\nM. Madeleine rose.\n\n\"Javert, you are a man of honor, and I esteem you. You exaggerate your\nfault. Moreover, this is an offence which concerns me. Javert, you\ndeserve promotion instead of degradation. I wish you to retain your\npost.\"\n\nJavert gazed at M. Madeleine with his candid eyes, in whose depths his\nnot very enlightened but pure and rigid conscience seemed visible, and\nsaid in a tranquil voice:--\n\n\"Mr. Mayor, I cannot grant you that.\"\n\n\"I repeat,\" replied M. Madeleine, \"that the matter concerns me.\"\n\nBut Javert, heeding his own thought only, continued:--\n\n\"So far as exaggeration is concerned, I am not exaggerating. This is the\nway I reason: I have suspected you unjustly. That is nothing. It is our\nright to cherish suspicion, although suspicion directed above ourselves\nis an abuse. But without proofs, in a fit of rage, with the object\nof wreaking my vengeance, I have denounced you as a convict, you, a\nrespectable man, a mayor, a magistrate! That is serious, very serious. I\nhave insulted authority in your person, I, an agent of the authorities!\nIf one of my subordinates had done what I have done, I should have\ndeclared him unworthy of the service, and have expelled him. Well? Stop,\nMr. Mayor; one word more. I have often been severe in the course of my\nlife towards others. That is just. I have done well. Now, if I were not\nsevere towards myself, all the justice that I have done would become\ninjustice. Ought I to spare myself more than others? No! What! I should\nbe good for nothing but to chastise others, and not myself! Why, I\nshould be a blackguard! Those who say, 'That blackguard of a Javert!'\nwould be in the right. Mr. Mayor, I do not desire that you should treat\nme kindly; your kindness roused sufficient bad blood in me when it was\ndirected to others. I want none of it for myself. The kindness which\nconsists in upholding a woman of the town against a citizen, the police\nagent against the mayor, the man who is down against the man who is\nup in the world, is what I call false kindness. That is the sort of\nkindness which disorganizes society. Good God! it is very easy to be\nkind; the difficulty lies in being just. Come! if you had been what I\nthought you, I should not have been kind to you, not I! You would have\nseen! Mr. Mayor, I must treat myself as I would treat any other man.\nWhen I have subdued malefactors, when I have proceeded with vigor\nagainst rascals, I have often said to myself, 'If you flinch, if I ever\ncatch you in fault, you may rest at your ease!' I have flinched, I\nhave caught myself in a fault. So much the worse! Come, discharged,\ncashiered, expelled! That is well. I have arms. I will till the soil; it\nmakes no difference to me. Mr. Mayor, the good of the service demands an\nexample. I simply require the discharge of Inspector Javert.\"\n\nAll this was uttered in a proud, humble, despairing, yet convinced tone,\nwhich lent indescribable grandeur to this singular, honest man.\n\n\"We shall see,\" said M. Madeleine.\n\nAnd he offered him his hand.\n\nJavert recoiled, and said in a wild voice:--\n\n\"Excuse me, Mr. Mayor, but this must not be. A mayor does not offer his\nhand to a police spy.\"\n\nHe added between his teeth:--\n\n\"A police spy, yes; from the moment when I have misused the police. I am\nno more than a police spy.\"\n\nThen he bowed profoundly, and directed his steps towards the door.\n\nThere he wheeled round, and with eyes still downcast:--\n\n\"Mr. Mayor,\" he said, \"I shall continue to serve until I am superseded.\"\n\nHe withdrew. M. Madeleine remained thoughtfully listening to the firm,\nsure step, which died away on the pavement of the corridor.\n\n\n\n\nBOOK SEVENTH.--THE CHAMPMATHIEU AFFAIR\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I--SISTER SIMPLICE\n\nThe incidents the reader is about to peruse were not all known at M. sur\nM. But the small portion of them which became known left such a memory\nin that town that a serious gap would exist in this book if we did\nnot narrate them in their most minute details. Among these details the\nreader will encounter two or three improbable circumstances, which we\npreserve out of respect for the truth.\n\nOn the afternoon following the visit of Javert, M. Madeleine went to see\nFantine according to his wont.\n\nBefore entering Fantine's room, he had Sister Simplice summoned.\n\nThe two nuns who performed the services of nurse in the infirmary,\nLazariste ladies, like all sisters of charity, bore the names of Sister\nPerpetue and Sister Simplice.\n\nSister Perpetue was an ordinary villager, a sister of charity in a\ncoarse style, who had entered the service of God as one enters any other\nservice. She was a nun as other women are cooks. This type is not\nso very rare. The monastic orders gladly accept this heavy peasant\nearthenware, which is easily fashioned into a Capuchin or an Ursuline.\nThese rustics are utilized for the rough work of devotion. The\ntransition from a drover to a Carmelite is not in the least violent;\nthe one turns into the other without much effort; the fund of ignorance\ncommon to the village and the cloister is a preparation ready at hand,\nand places the boor at once on the same footing as the monk: a little\nmore amplitude in the smock, and it becomes a frock. Sister Perpetue\nwas a robust nun from Marines near Pontoise, who chattered her patois,\ndroned, grumbled, sugared the potion according to the bigotry or the\nhypocrisy of the invalid, treated her patients abruptly, roughly, was\ncrabbed with the dying, almost flung God in their faces, stoned their\ndeath agony with prayers mumbled in a rage; was bold, honest, and ruddy.\n\nSister Simplice was white, with a waxen pallor. Beside Sister Perpetue,\nshe was the taper beside the candle. Vincent de Paul has divinely traced\nthe features of the Sister of Charity in these admirable words, in which\nhe mingles as much freedom as servitude: \"They shall have for their\nconvent only the house of the sick; for cell only a hired room; for\nchapel only their parish church; for cloister only the streets of the\ntown and the wards of the hospitals; for enclosure only obedience; for\ngratings only the fear of God; for veil only modesty.\" This ideal was\nrealized in the living person of Sister Simplice: she had never been\nyoung, and it seemed as though she would never grow old. No one could\nhave told Sister Simplice's age. She was a person--we dare not say a\nwoman--who was gentle, austere, well-bred, cold, and who had never lied.\nShe was so gentle that she appeared fragile; but she was more solid than\ngranite. She touched the unhappy with fingers that were charmingly pure\nand fine. There was, so to speak, silence in her speech; she said just\nwhat was necessary, and she possessed a tone of voice which would\nhave equally edified a confessional or enchanted a drawing-room. This\ndelicacy accommodated itself to the serge gown, finding in this harsh\ncontact a continual reminder of heaven and of God. Let us emphasize\none detail. Never to have lied, never to have said, for any interest\nwhatever, even in indifference, any single thing which was not the\ntruth, the sacred truth, was Sister Simplice's distinctive trait; it was\nthe accent of her virtue. She was almost renowned in the congregation\nfor this imperturbable veracity. The Abbe Sicard speaks of Sister\nSimplice in a letter to the deaf-mute Massieu. However pure and sincere\nwe may be, we all bear upon our candor the crack of the little, innocent\nlie. She did not. Little lie, innocent lie--does such a thing exist? To\nlie is the absolute form of evil. To lie a little is not possible: he\nwho lies, lies the whole lie. To lie is the very face of the demon.\nSatan has two names; he is called Satan and Lying. That is what she\nthought; and as she thought, so she did. The result was the whiteness\nwhich we have mentioned--a whiteness which covered even her lips and her\neyes with radiance. Her smile was white, her glance was white. There was\nnot a single spider's web, not a grain of dust, on the glass window of\nthat conscience. On entering the order of Saint Vincent de Paul, she had\ntaken the name of Simplice by special choice. Simplice of Sicily, as we\nknow, is the saint who preferred to allow both her breasts to be torn\noff rather than to say that she had been born at Segesta when she had\nbeen born at Syracuse--a lie which would have saved her. This patron\nsaint suited this soul.\n\nSister Simplice, on her entrance into the order, had had two faults\nwhich she had gradually corrected: she had a taste for dainties, and she\nliked to receive letters. She never read anything but a book of prayers\nprinted in Latin, in coarse type. She did not understand Latin, but she\nunderstood the book.\n\nThis pious woman had conceived an affection for Fantine, probably\nfeeling a latent virtue there, and she had devoted herself almost\nexclusively to her care.\n\nM. Madeleine took Sister Simplice apart and recommended Fantine to her\nin a singular tone, which the sister recalled later on.\n\nOn leaving the sister, he approached Fantine.\n\nFantine awaited M. Madeleine's appearance every day as one awaits a ray\nof warmth and joy. She said to the sisters, \"I only live when Monsieur\nle Maire is here.\"\n\nShe had a great deal of fever that day. As soon as she saw M. Madeleine\nshe asked him:--\n\n\"And Cosette?\"\n\nHe replied with a smile:--\n\n\"Soon.\"\n\nM. Madeleine was the same as usual with Fantine. Only he remained an\nhour instead of half an hour, to Fantine's great delight. He urged every\none repeatedly not to allow the invalid to want for anything. It was\nnoticed that there was a moment when his countenance became very sombre.\nBut this was explained when it became known that the doctor had bent\ndown to his ear and said to him, \"She is losing ground fast.\"\n\nThen he returned to the town-hall, and the clerk observed him\nattentively examining a road map of France which hung in his study. He\nwrote a few figures on a bit of paper with a pencil.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II--THE PERSPICACITY OF MASTER SCAUFFLAIRE\n\nFrom the town-hall he betook himself to the extremity of the town, to a\nFleming named Master Scaufflaer, French Scaufflaire, who let out \"horses\nand cabriolets as desired.\"\n\nIn order to reach this Scaufflaire, the shortest way was to take the\nlittle-frequented street in which was situated the parsonage of the\nparish in which M. Madeleine resided. The cure was, it was said, a\nworthy, respectable, and sensible man. At the moment when M. Madeleine\narrived in front of the parsonage there was but one passer-by in the\nstreet, and this person noticed this: After the mayor had passed the\npriest's house he halted, stood motionless, then turned about, and\nretraced his steps to the door of the parsonage, which had an iron\nknocker. He laid his hand quickly on the knocker and lifted it; then\nhe paused again and stopped short, as though in thought, and after\nthe lapse of a few seconds, instead of allowing the knocker to fall\nabruptly, he placed it gently, and resumed his way with a sort of haste\nwhich had not been apparent previously.\n\nM. Madeleine found Master Scaufflaire at home, engaged in stitching a\nharness over.\n\n\"Master Scaufflaire,\" he inquired, \"have you a good horse?\"\n\n\"Mr. Mayor,\" said the Fleming, \"all my horses are good. What do you mean\nby a good horse?\"\n\n\"I mean a horse which can travel twenty leagues in a day.\"\n\n\"The deuce!\" said the Fleming. \"Twenty leagues!\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Hitched to a cabriolet?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"And how long can he rest at the end of his journey?\"\n\n\"He must be able to set out again on the next day if necessary.\"\n\n\"To traverse the same road?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"The deuce! the deuce! And it is twenty leagues?\"\n\nM. Madeleine drew from his pocket the paper on which he had pencilled\nsome figures. He showed it to the Fleming. The figures were 5, 6, 8 1/2.\n\n\"You see,\" he said, \"total, nineteen and a half; as well say twenty\nleagues.\"\n\n\"Mr. Mayor,\" returned the Fleming, \"I have just what you want. My little\nwhite horse--you may have seen him pass occasionally; he is a small\nbeast from Lower Boulonnais. He is full of fire. They wanted to make\na saddle-horse of him at first. Bah! He reared, he kicked, he laid\neverybody flat on the ground. He was thought to be vicious, and no one\nknew what to do with him. I bought him. I harnessed him to a carriage.\nThat is what he wanted, sir; he is as gentle as a girl; he goes like the\nwind. Ah! indeed he must not be mounted. It does not suit his ideas to\nbe a saddle-horse. Every one has his ambition. 'Draw? Yes. Carry? No.'\nWe must suppose that is what he said to himself.\"\n\n\"And he will accomplish the trip?\"\n\n\"Your twenty leagues all at a full trot, and in less than eight hours.\nBut here are the conditions.\"\n\n\"State them.\"\n\n\"In the first place, you will give him half an hour's breathing spell\nmidway of the road; he will eat; and some one must be by while he is\neating to prevent the stable boy of the inn from stealing his oats; for\nI have noticed that in inns the oats are more often drunk by the stable\nmen than eaten by the horses.\"\n\n\"Some one will be by.\"\n\n\"In the second place--is the cabriolet for Monsieur le Maire?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Does Monsieur le Maire know how to drive?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Well, Monsieur le Maire will travel alone and without baggage, in order\nnot to overload the horse?\"\n\n\"Agreed.\"\n\n\"But as Monsieur le Maire will have no one with him, he will be obliged\nto take the trouble himself of seeing that the oats are not stolen.\"\n\n\"That is understood.\"\n\n\"I am to have thirty francs a day. The days of rest to be paid for\nalso--not a farthing less; and the beast's food to be at Monsieur le\nMaire's expense.\"\n\nM. Madeleine drew three napoleons from his purse and laid them on the\ntable.\n\n\"Here is the pay for two days in advance.\"\n\n\"Fourthly, for such a journey a cabriolet would be too heavy, and would\nfatigue the horse. Monsieur le Maire must consent to travel in a little\ntilbury that I own.\"\n\n\"I consent to that.\"\n\n\"It is light, but it has no cover.\"\n\n\"That makes no difference to me.\"\n\n\"Has Monsieur le Maire reflected that we are in the middle of winter?\"\n\nM. Madeleine did not reply. The Fleming resumed:--\n\n\"That it is very cold?\"\n\nM. Madeleine preserved silence.\n\nMaster Scaufflaire continued:--\n\n\"That it may rain?\"\n\nM. Madeleine raised his head and said:--\n\n\"The tilbury and the horse will be in front of my door to-morrow morning\nat half-past four o'clock.\"\n\n\"Of course, Monsieur le Maire,\" replied Scaufflaire; then, scratching a\nspeck in the wood of the table with his thumb-nail, he resumed with that\ncareless air which the Flemings understand so well how to mingle with\ntheir shrewdness:--\n\n\"But this is what I am thinking of now: Monsieur le Maire has not told\nme where he is going. Where is Monsieur le Maire going?\"\n\nHe had been thinking of nothing else since the beginning of the\nconversation, but he did not know why he had not dared to put the\nquestion.\n\n\"Are your horse's forelegs good?\" said M. Madeleine.\n\n\"Yes, Monsieur le Maire. You must hold him in a little when going down\nhill. Are there many descends between here and the place whither you are\ngoing?\"\n\n\"Do not forget to be at my door at precisely half-past four o'clock\nto-morrow morning,\" replied M. Madeleine; and he took his departure.\n\nThe Fleming remained \"utterly stupid,\" as he himself said some time\nafterwards.\n\nThe mayor had been gone two or three minutes when the door opened again;\nit was the mayor once more.\n\nHe still wore the same impassive and preoccupied air.\n\n\"Monsieur Scaufflaire,\" said he, \"at what sum do you estimate the value\nof the horse and tilbury which you are to let to me,--the one bearing\nthe other?\"\n\n\"The one dragging the other, Monsieur le Maire,\" said the Fleming, with\na broad smile.\n\n\"So be it. Well?\"\n\n\"Does Monsieur le Maire wish to purchase them or me?\"\n\n\"No; but I wish to guarantee you in any case. You shall give me back\nthe sum at my return. At what value do you estimate your horse and\ncabriolet?\"\n\n\"Five hundred francs, Monsieur le Maire.\"\n\n\"Here it is.\"\n\nM. Madeleine laid a bank-bill on the table, then left the room; and this\ntime he did not return.\n\nMaster Scaufflaire experienced a frightful regret that he had not said a\nthousand francs. Besides the horse and tilbury together were worth but a\nhundred crowns.\n\nThe Fleming called his wife, and related the affair to her. \"Where the\ndevil could Monsieur le Maire be going?\" They held counsel together.\n\"He is going to Paris,\" said the wife. \"I don't believe it,\" said the\nhusband.\n\nM. Madeleine had forgotten the paper with the figures on it, and it lay\non the chimney-piece. The Fleming picked it up and studied it. \"Five,\nsix, eight and a half? That must designate the posting relays.\" He\nturned to his wife:--\n\n\"I have found out.\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"It is five leagues from here to Hesdin, six from Hesdin to Saint-Pol,\neight and a half from Saint-Pol to Arras. He is going to Arras.\"\n\nMeanwhile, M. Madeleine had returned home. He had taken the longest way\nto return from Master Scaufflaire's, as though the parsonage door had\nbeen a temptation for him, and he had wished to avoid it. He ascended\nto his room, and there he shut himself up, which was a very simple act,\nsince he liked to go to bed early. Nevertheless, the portress of the\nfactory, who was, at the same time, M. Madeleine's only servant, noticed\nthat the latter's light was extinguished at half-past eight, and she\nmentioned it to the cashier when he came home, adding:--\n\n\"Is Monsieur le Maire ill? I thought he had a rather singular air.\"\n\nThis cashier occupied a room situated directly under M. Madeleine's\nchamber. He paid no heed to the portress's words, but went to bed and\nto sleep. Towards midnight he woke up with a start; in his sleep he had\nheard a noise above his head. He listened; it was a footstep pacing back\nand forth, as though some one were walking in the room above him. He\nlistened more attentively, and recognized M. Madeleine's step. This\nstruck him as strange; usually, there was no noise in M. Madeleine's\nchamber until he rose in the morning. A moment later the cashier heard\na noise which resembled that of a cupboard being opened, and then shut\nagain; then a piece of furniture was disarranged; then a pause ensued;\nthen the step began again. The cashier sat up in bed, quite awake now,\nand staring; and through his window-panes he saw the reddish gleam of a\nlighted window reflected on the opposite wall; from the direction of the\nrays, it could only come from the window of M. Madeleine's chamber. The\nreflection wavered, as though it came rather from a fire which had\nbeen lighted than from a candle. The shadow of the window-frame was not\nshown, which indicated that the window was wide open. The fact that this\nwindow was open in such cold weather was surprising. The cashier fell\nasleep again. An hour or two later he waked again. The same step was\nstill passing slowly and regularly back and forth overhead.\n\nThe reflection was still visible on the wall, but now it was pale and\npeaceful, like the reflection of a lamp or of a candle. The window was\nstill open.\n\nThis is what had taken place in M. Madeleine's room.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III--A TEMPEST IN A SKULL\n\nThe reader has, no doubt, already divined that M. Madeleine is no other\nthan Jean Valjean.\n\nWe have already gazed into the depths of this conscience; the moment has\nnow come when we must take another look into it. We do so not without\nemotion and trepidation. There is nothing more terrible in existence\nthan this sort of contemplation. The eye of the spirit can nowhere find\nmore dazzling brilliance and more shadow than in man; it can fix itself\non no other thing which is more formidable, more complicated, more\nmysterious, and more infinite. There is a spectacle more grand than the\nsea; it is heaven: there is a spectacle more grand than heaven; it is\nthe inmost recesses of the soul.\n\nTo make the poem of the human conscience, were it only with reference to\na single man, were it only in connection with the basest of men, would\nbe to blend all epics into one superior and definitive epic. Conscience\nis the chaos of chimeras, of lusts, and of temptations; the furnace of\ndreams; the lair of ideas of which we are ashamed; it is the pandemonium\nof sophisms; it is the battlefield of the passions. Penetrate, at\ncertain hours, past the livid face of a human being who is engaged\nin reflection, and look behind, gaze into that soul, gaze into that\nobscurity. There, beneath that external silence, battles of giants,\nlike those recorded in Homer, are in progress; skirmishes of dragons and\nhydras and swarms of phantoms, as in Milton; visionary circles, as in\nDante. What a solemn thing is this infinity which every man bears within\nhim, and which he measures with despair against the caprices of his\nbrain and the actions of his life!\n\nAlighieri one day met with a sinister-looking door, before which he\nhesitated. Here is one before us, upon whose threshold we hesitate. Let\nus enter, nevertheless.\n\nWe have but little to add to what the reader already knows of what had\nhappened to Jean Valjean after the adventure with Little Gervais. From\nthat moment forth he was, as we have seen, a totally different man. What\nthe Bishop had wished to make of him, that he carried out. It was more\nthan a transformation; it was a transfiguration.\n\nHe succeeded in disappearing, sold the Bishop's silver, reserving only\nthe candlesticks as a souvenir, crept from town to town, traversed\nFrance, came to M. sur M., conceived the idea which we have mentioned,\naccomplished what we have related, succeeded in rendering himself safe\nfrom seizure and inaccessible, and, thenceforth, established at M. sur\nM., happy in feeling his conscience saddened by the past and the first\nhalf of his existence belied by the last, he lived in peace, reassured\nand hopeful, having henceforth only two thoughts,--to conceal his name\nand to sanctify his life; to escape men and to return to God.\n\nThese two thoughts were so closely intertwined in his mind that\nthey formed but a single one there; both were equally absorbing and\nimperative and ruled his slightest actions. In general, they conspired\nto regulate the conduct of his life; they turned him towards the gloom;\nthey rendered him kindly and simple; they counselled him to the same\nthings. Sometimes, however, they conflicted. In that case, as the reader\nwill remember, the man whom all the country of M. sur M. called M.\nMadeleine did not hesitate to sacrifice the first to the second--his\nsecurity to his virtue. Thus, in spite of all his reserve and all his\nprudence, he had preserved the Bishop's candlesticks, worn mourning for\nhim, summoned and interrogated all the little Savoyards who passed that\nway, collected information regarding the families at Faverolles, and\nsaved old Fauchelevent's life, despite the disquieting insinuations of\nJavert. It seemed, as we have already remarked, as though he thought,\nfollowing the example of all those who have been wise, holy, and just,\nthat his first duty was not towards himself.\n\nAt the same time, it must be confessed, nothing just like this had yet\npresented itself.\n\nNever had the two ideas which governed the unhappy man whose sufferings\nwe are narrating, engaged in so serious a struggle. He understood this\nconfusedly but profoundly at the very first words pronounced by Javert,\nwhen the latter entered his study. At the moment when that name, which\nhe had buried beneath so many layers, was so strangely articulated,\nhe was struck with stupor, and as though intoxicated with the sinister\neccentricity of his destiny; and through this stupor he felt that\nshudder which precedes great shocks. He bent like an oak at the approach\nof a storm, like a soldier at the approach of an assault. He felt\nshadows filled with thunders and lightnings descending upon his head.\nAs he listened to Javert, the first thought which occurred to him was to\ngo, to run and denounce himself, to take that Champmathieu out of prison\nand place himself there; this was as painful and as poignant as an\nincision in the living flesh. Then it passed away, and he said to\nhimself, \"We will see! We will see!\" He repressed this first, generous\ninstinct, and recoiled before heroism.\n\nIt would be beautiful, no doubt, after the Bishop's holy words, after\nso many years of repentance and abnegation, in the midst of a penitence\nadmirably begun, if this man had not flinched for an instant, even in\nthe presence of so terrible a conjecture, but had continued to walk with\nthe same step towards this yawning precipice, at the bottom of which\nlay heaven; that would have been beautiful; but it was not thus. We must\nrender an account of the things which went on in this soul, and we can\nonly tell what there was there. He was carried away, at first, by\nthe instinct of self-preservation; he rallied all his ideas in haste,\nstifled his emotions, took into consideration Javert's presence, that\ngreat danger, postponed all decision with the firmness of terror, shook\noff thought as to what he had to do, and resumed his calmness as a\nwarrior picks up his buckler.\n\nHe remained in this state during the rest of the day, a whirlwind\nwithin, a profound tranquillity without. He took no \"preservative\nmeasures,\" as they may be called. Everything was still confused, and\njostling together in his brain. His trouble was so great that he could\nnot perceive the form of a single idea distinctly, and he could have\ntold nothing about himself, except that he had received a great blow.\n\nHe repaired to Fantine's bed of suffering, as usual, and prolonged his\nvisit, through a kindly instinct, telling himself that he must behave\nthus, and recommend her well to the sisters, in case he should be\nobliged to be absent himself. He had a vague feeling that he might be\nobliged to go to Arras; and without having the least in the world made\nup his mind to this trip, he said to himself that being, as he was,\nbeyond the shadow of any suspicion, there could be nothing out of the\nway in being a witness to what was to take place, and he engaged the\ntilbury from Scaufflaire in order to be prepared in any event.\n\nHe dined with a good deal of appetite.\n\nOn returning to his room, he communed with himself.\n\nHe examined the situation, and found it unprecedented; so unprecedented\nthat in the midst of his revery he rose from his chair, moved by some\ninexplicable impulse of anxiety, and bolted his door. He feared\nlest something more should enter. He was barricading himself against\npossibilities.\n\nA moment later he extinguished his light; it embarrassed him.\n\nIt seemed to him as though he might be seen.\n\nBy whom?\n\nAlas! That on which he desired to close the door had already entered;\nthat which he desired to blind was staring him in the face,--his\nconscience.\n\nHis conscience; that is to say, God.\n\nNevertheless, he deluded himself at first; he had a feeling of security\nand of solitude; the bolt once drawn, he thought himself impregnable;\nthe candle extinguished, he felt himself invisible. Then he took\npossession of himself: he set his elbows on the table, leaned his head\non his hand, and began to meditate in the dark.\n\n\"Where do I stand? Am not I dreaming? What have I heard? Is it really\ntrue that I have seen that Javert, and that he spoke to me in that\nmanner? Who can that Champmathieu be? So he resembles me! Is it\npossible? When I reflect that yesterday I was so tranquil, and so far\nfrom suspecting anything! What was I doing yesterday at this hour? What\nis there in this incident? What will the end be? What is to be done?\"\n\nThis was the torment in which he found himself. His brain had lost its\npower of retaining ideas; they passed like waves, and he clutched his\nbrow in both hands to arrest them.\n\nNothing but anguish extricated itself from this tumult which overwhelmed\nhis will and his reason, and from which he sought to draw proof and\nresolution.\n\nHis head was burning. He went to the window and threw it wide open.\nThere were no stars in the sky. He returned and seated himself at the\ntable.\n\nThe first hour passed in this manner.\n\nGradually, however, vague outlines began to take form and to fix\nthemselves in his meditation, and he was able to catch a glimpse with\nprecision of the reality,--not the whole situation, but some of\nthe details. He began by recognizing the fact that, critical and\nextraordinary as was this situation, he was completely master of it.\n\nThis only caused an increase of his stupor.\n\nIndependently of the severe and religious aim which he had assigned to\nhis actions, all that he had made up to that day had been nothing but a\nhole in which to bury his name. That which he had always feared most of\nall in his hours of self-communion, during his sleepless nights, was to\never hear that name pronounced; he had said to himself, that that would\nbe the end of all things for him; that on the day when that name made\nits reappearance it would cause his new life to vanish from about\nhim, and--who knows?--perhaps even his new soul within him, also. He\nshuddered at the very thought that this was possible. Assuredly, if any\none had said to him at such moments that the hour would come when that\nname would ring in his ears, when the hideous words, Jean Valjean, would\nsuddenly emerge from the darkness and rise in front of him, when that\nformidable light, capable of dissipating the mystery in which he had\nenveloped himself, would suddenly blaze forth above his head, and that\nthat name would not menace him, that that light would but produce\nan obscurity more dense, that this rent veil would but increase the\nmystery, that this earthquake would solidify his edifice, that this\nprodigious incident would have no other result, so far as he was\nconcerned, if so it seemed good to him, than that of rendering his\nexistence at once clearer and more impenetrable, and that, out of his\nconfrontation with the phantom of Jean Valjean, the good and worthy\ncitizen Monsieur Madeleine would emerge more honored, more peaceful, and\nmore respected than ever--if any one had told him that, he would have\ntossed his head and regarded the words as those of a madman. Well, all\nthis was precisely what had just come to pass; all that accumulation of\nimpossibilities was a fact, and God had permitted these wild fancies to\nbecome real things!\n\nHis revery continued to grow clearer. He came more and more to an\nunderstanding of his position.\n\nIt seemed to him that he had but just waked up from some inexplicable\ndream, and that he found himself slipping down a declivity in the middle\nof the night, erect, shivering, holding back all in vain, on the very\nbrink of the abyss. He distinctly perceived in the darkness a stranger,\na man unknown to him, whom destiny had mistaken for him, and whom she\nwas thrusting into the gulf in his stead; in order that the gulf might\nclose once more, it was necessary that some one, himself or that other\nman, should fall into it: he had only let things take their course.\n\nThe light became complete, and he acknowledged this to himself: That\nhis place was empty in the galleys; that do what he would, it was still\nawaiting him; that the theft from little Gervais had led him back to it;\nthat this vacant place would await him, and draw him on until he filled\nit; that this was inevitable and fatal; and then he said to himself,\n\"that, at this moment, he had a substitute; that it appeared that a\ncertain Champmathieu had that ill luck, and that, as regards himself,\nbeing present in the galleys in the person of that Champmathieu, present\nin society under the name of M. Madeleine, he had nothing more to fear,\nprovided that he did not prevent men from sealing over the head of\nthat Champmathieu this stone of infamy which, like the stone of the\nsepulchre, falls once, never to rise again.\"\n\nAll this was so strange and so violent, that there suddenly took place\nin him that indescribable movement, which no man feels more than two\nor three times in the course of his life, a sort of convulsion of the\nconscience which stirs up all that there is doubtful in the heart, which\nis composed of irony, of joy, and of despair, and which may be called an\noutburst of inward laughter.\n\nHe hastily relighted his candle.\n\n\"Well, what then?\" he said to himself; \"what am I afraid of? What is\nthere in all that for me to think about? I am safe; all is over. I had\nbut one partly open door through which my past might invade my life,\nand behold that door is walled up forever! That Javert, who has been\nannoying me so long; that terrible instinct which seemed to have divined\nme, which had divined me--good God! and which followed me everywhere;\nthat frightful hunting-dog, always making a point at me, is thrown\noff the scent, engaged elsewhere, absolutely turned from the trail:\nhenceforth he is satisfied; he will leave me in peace; he has his Jean\nValjean. Who knows? it is even probable that he will wish to leave town!\nAnd all this has been brought about without any aid from me, and I count\nfor nothing in it! Ah! but where is the misfortune in this? Upon my\nhonor, people would think, to see me, that some catastrophe had happened\nto me! After all, if it does bring harm to some one, that is not my\nfault in the least: it is Providence which has done it all; it is\nbecause it wishes it so to be, evidently. Have I the right to disarrange\nwhat it has arranged? What do I ask now? Why should I meddle? It does\nnot concern me; what! I am not satisfied: but what more do I want? The\ngoal to which I have aspired for so many years, the dream of my nights,\nthe object of my prayers to Heaven,--security,--I have now attained; it\nis God who wills it; I can do nothing against the will of God, and why\ndoes God will it? In order that I may continue what I have begun, that I\nmay do good, that I may one day be a grand and encouraging example, that\nit may be said at last, that a little happiness has been attached to\nthe penance which I have undergone, and to that virtue to which I have\nreturned. Really, I do not understand why I was afraid, a little while\nago, to enter the house of that good cure, and to ask his advice; this\nis evidently what he would have said to me: It is settled; let things\ntake their course; let the good God do as he likes!\"\n\nThus did he address himself in the depths of his own conscience, bending\nover what may be called his own abyss; he rose from his chair, and began\nto pace the room: \"Come,\" said he, \"let us think no more about it; my\nresolve is taken!\" but he felt no joy.\n\nQuite the reverse.\n\nOne can no more prevent thought from recurring to an idea than one can\nthe sea from returning to the shore: the sailor calls it the tide; the\nguilty man calls it remorse; God upheaves the soul as he does the ocean.\n\nAfter the expiration of a few moments, do what he would, he resumed the\ngloomy dialogue in which it was he who spoke and he who listened, saying\nthat which he would have preferred to ignore, and listened to that which\nhe would have preferred not to hear, yielding to that mysterious power\nwhich said to him: \"Think!\" as it said to another condemned man, two\nthousand years ago, \"March on!\"\n\nBefore proceeding further, and in order to make ourselves fully\nunderstood, let us insist upon one necessary observation.\n\nIt is certain that people do talk to themselves; there is no living\nbeing who has not done it. It may even be said that the word is never\na more magnificent mystery than when it goes from thought to conscience\nwithin a man, and when it returns from conscience to thought; it is in\nthis sense only that the words so often employed in this chapter, he\nsaid, he exclaimed, must be understood; one speaks to one's self, talks\nto one's self, exclaims to one's self without breaking the external\nsilence; there is a great tumult; everything about us talks except the\nmouth. The realities of the soul are none the less realities because\nthey are not visible and palpable.\n\nSo he asked himself where he stood. He interrogated himself upon that\n\"settled resolve.\" He confessed to himself that all that he had just\narranged in his mind was monstrous, that \"to let things take their\ncourse, to let the good God do as he liked,\" was simply horrible; to\nallow this error of fate and of men to be carried out, not to hinder it,\nto lend himself to it through his silence, to do nothing, in short,\nwas to do everything! that this was hypocritical baseness in the last\ndegree! that it was a base, cowardly, sneaking, abject, hideous crime!\n\nFor the first time in eight years, the wretched man had just tasted the\nbitter savor of an evil thought and of an evil action.\n\nHe spit it out with disgust.\n\nHe continued to question himself. He asked himself severely what he had\nmeant by this, \"My object is attained!\" He declared to himself that\nhis life really had an object; but what object? To conceal his name?\nTo deceive the police? Was it for so petty a thing that he had done all\nthat he had done? Had he not another and a grand object, which was the\ntrue one--to save, not his person, but his soul; to become honest and\ngood once more; to be a just man? Was it not that above all, that alone,\nwhich he had always desired, which the Bishop had enjoined upon him--to\nshut the door on his past? But he was not shutting it! great God! he was\nre-opening it by committing an infamous action! He was becoming a thief\nonce more, and the most odious of thieves! He was robbing another of\nhis existence, his life, his peace, his place in the sunshine. He was\nbecoming an assassin. He was murdering, morally murdering, a wretched\nman. He was inflicting on him that frightful living death, that death\nbeneath the open sky, which is called the galleys. On the other hand,\nto surrender himself to save that man, struck down with so melancholy\nan error, to resume his own name, to become once more, out of duty, the\nconvict Jean Valjean, that was, in truth, to achieve his resurrection,\nand to close forever that hell whence he had just emerged; to fall back\nthere in appearance was to escape from it in reality. This must be\ndone! He had done nothing if he did not do all this; his whole life was\nuseless; all his penitence was wasted. There was no longer any need of\nsaying, \"What is the use?\" He felt that the Bishop was there, that the\nBishop was present all the more because he was dead, that the Bishop\nwas gazing fixedly at him, that henceforth Mayor Madeleine, with all his\nvirtues, would be abominable to him, and that the convict Jean Valjean\nwould be pure and admirable in his sight; that men beheld his mask, but\nthat the Bishop saw his face; that men saw his life, but that the Bishop\nbeheld his conscience. So he must go to Arras, deliver the false Jean\nValjean, and denounce the real one. Alas! that was the greatest of\nsacrifices, the most poignant of victories, the last step to take; but\nit must be done. Sad fate! he would enter into sanctity only in the eyes\nof God when he returned to infamy in the eyes of men.\n\n\"Well,\" said he, \"let us decide upon this; let us do our duty; let us\nsave this man.\" He uttered these words aloud, without perceiving that he\nwas speaking aloud.\n\nHe took his books, verified them, and put them in order. He flung in\nthe fire a bundle of bills which he had against petty and embarrassed\ntradesmen. He wrote and sealed a letter, and on the envelope it might\nhave been read, had there been any one in his chamber at the moment,\nTo Monsieur Laffitte, Banker, Rue d'Artois, Paris. He drew from his\nsecretary a pocket-book which contained several bank-notes and the\npassport of which he had made use that same year when he went to the\nelections.\n\nAny one who had seen him during the execution of these various acts,\ninto which there entered such grave thought, would have had no suspicion\nof what was going on within him. Only occasionally did his lips move; at\nother times he raised his head and fixed his gaze upon some point of the\nwall, as though there existed at that point something which he wished to\nelucidate or interrogate.\n\nWhen he had finished the letter to M. Laffitte, he put it into his\npocket, together with the pocket-book, and began his walk once more.\n\nHis revery had not swerved from its course. He continued to see his duty\nclearly, written in luminous letters, which flamed before his eyes and\nchanged its place as he altered the direction of his glance:--\n\n\"Go! Tell your name! Denounce yourself!\"\n\nIn the same way he beheld, as though they had passed before him in\nvisible forms, the two ideas which had, up to that time, formed\nthe double rule of his soul,--the concealment of his name, the\nsanctification of his life. For the first time they appeared to him as\nabsolutely distinct, and he perceived the distance which separated them.\nHe recognized the fact that one of these ideas was, necessarily, good,\nwhile the other might become bad; that the first was self-devotion, and\nthat the other was personality; that the one said, my neighbor, and that\nthe other said, myself; that one emanated from the light, and the other\nfrom darkness.\n\nThey were antagonistic. He saw them in conflict. In proportion as\nhe meditated, they grew before the eyes of his spirit. They had now\nattained colossal statures, and it seemed to him that he beheld within\nhimself, in that infinity of which we were recently speaking, in the\nmidst of the darkness and the lights, a goddess and a giant contending.\n\nHe was filled with terror; but it seemed to him that the good thought\nwas getting the upper hand.\n\nHe felt that he was on the brink of the second decisive crisis of his\nconscience and of his destiny; that the Bishop had marked the first\nphase of his new life, and that Champmathieu marked the second. After\nthe grand crisis, the grand test.\n\nBut the fever, allayed for an instant, gradually resumed possession\nof him. A thousand thoughts traversed his mind, but they continued to\nfortify him in his resolution.\n\nOne moment he said to himself that he was, perhaps, taking the matter\ntoo keenly; that, after all, this Champmathieu was not interesting, and\nthat he had actually been guilty of theft.\n\nHe answered himself: \"If this man has, indeed, stolen a few apples, that\nmeans a month in prison. It is a long way from that to the galleys. And\nwho knows? Did he steal? Has it been proved? The name of Jean Valjean\noverwhelms him, and seems to dispense with proofs. Do not the attorneys\nfor the Crown always proceed in this manner? He is supposed to be a\nthief because he is known to be a convict.\"\n\nIn another instant the thought had occurred to him that, when he\ndenounced himself, the heroism of his deed might, perhaps, be taken into\nconsideration, and his honest life for the last seven years, and what he\nhad done for the district, and that they would have mercy on him.\n\nBut this supposition vanished very quickly, and he smiled bitterly as he\nremembered that the theft of the forty sous from little Gervais put him\nin the position of a man guilty of a second offence after conviction,\nthat this affair would certainly come up, and, according to the precise\nterms of the law, would render him liable to penal servitude for life.\n\nHe turned aside from all illusions, detached himself more and more from\nearth, and sought strength and consolation elsewhere. He told himself\nthat he must do his duty; that perhaps he should not be more unhappy\nafter doing his duty than after having avoided it; that if he allowed\nthings to take their own course, if he remained at M. sur M., his\nconsideration, his good name, his good works, the deference and\nveneration paid to him, his charity, his wealth, his popularity, his\nvirtue, would be seasoned with a crime. And what would be the taste of\nall these holy things when bound up with this hideous thing? while, if\nhe accomplished his sacrifice, a celestial idea would be mingled with\nthe galleys, the post, the iron necklet, the green cap, unceasing toil,\nand pitiless shame.\n\nAt length he told himself that it must be so, that his destiny was thus\nallotted, that he had not authority to alter the arrangements made on\nhigh, that, in any case, he must make his choice: virtue without and\nabomination within, or holiness within and infamy without.\n\nThe stirring up of these lugubrious ideas did not cause his courage to\nfail, but his brain grow weary. He began to think of other things, of\nindifferent matters, in spite of himself.\n\nThe veins in his temples throbbed violently; he still paced to and fro;\nmidnight sounded first from the parish church, then from the town-hall;\nhe counted the twelve strokes of the two clocks, and compared the sounds\nof the two bells; he recalled in this connection the fact that, a few\ndays previously, he had seen in an ironmonger's shop an ancient clock\nfor sale, upon which was written the name, Antoine-Albin de Romainville.\n\nHe was cold; he lighted a small fire; it did not occur to him to close\nthe window.\n\nIn the meantime he had relapsed into his stupor; he was obliged to make\na tolerably vigorous effort to recall what had been the subject of his\nthoughts before midnight had struck; he finally succeeded in doing this.\n\n\"Ah! yes,\" he said to himself, \"I had resolved to inform against\nmyself.\"\n\nAnd then, all of a sudden, he thought of Fantine.\n\n\"Hold!\" said he, \"and what about that poor woman?\"\n\nHere a fresh crisis declared itself.\n\nFantine, by appearing thus abruptly in his revery, produced the effect\nof an unexpected ray of light; it seemed to him as though everything\nabout him were undergoing a change of aspect: he exclaimed:--\n\n\"Ah! but I have hitherto considered no one but myself; it is proper for\nme to hold my tongue or to denounce myself, to conceal my person or\nto save my soul, to be a despicable and respected magistrate, or an\ninfamous and venerable convict; it is I, it is always I and nothing\nbut I: but, good God! all this is egotism; these are diverse forms\nof egotism, but it is egotism all the same. What if I were to think a\nlittle about others? The highest holiness is to think of others; come,\nlet us examine the matter. The _I_ excepted, the _I_ effaced, the _I_\nforgotten, what would be the result of all this? What if I denounce\nmyself? I am arrested; this Champmathieu is released; I am put back in\nthe galleys; that is well--and what then? What is going on here? Ah!\nhere is a country, a town, here are factories, an industry, workers,\nboth men and women, aged grandsires, children, poor people! All this I\nhave created; all these I provide with their living; everywhere where\nthere is a smoking chimney, it is I who have placed the brand on the\nhearth and meat in the pot; I have created ease, circulation, credit;\nbefore me there was nothing; I have elevated, vivified, informed with\nlife, fecundated, stimulated, enriched the whole country-side; lacking\nme, the soul is lacking; I take myself off, everything dies: and this\nwoman, who has suffered so much, who possesses so many merits in spite\nof her fall; the cause of all whose misery I have unwittingly been! And\nthat child whom I meant to go in search of, whom I have promised to her\nmother; do I not also owe something to this woman, in reparation for\nthe evil which I have done her? If I disappear, what happens? The mother\ndies; the child becomes what it can; that is what will take place, if\nI denounce myself. If I do not denounce myself? come, let us see how it\nwill be if I do not denounce myself.\"\n\nAfter putting this question to himself, he paused; he seemed to undergo\na momentary hesitation and trepidation; but it did not last long, and he\nanswered himself calmly:--\n\n\"Well, this man is going to the galleys; it is true, but what the deuce!\nhe has stolen! There is no use in my saying that he has not been guilty\nof theft, for he has! I remain here; I go on: in ten years I shall have\nmade ten millions; I scatter them over the country; I have nothing of\nmy own; what is that to me? It is not for myself that I am doing it;\nthe prosperity of all goes on augmenting; industries are aroused and\nanimated; factories and shops are multiplied; families, a hundred\nfamilies, a thousand families, are happy; the district becomes\npopulated; villages spring up where there were only farms before;\nfarms rise where there was nothing; wretchedness disappears, and\nwith wretchedness debauchery, prostitution, theft, murder; all vices\ndisappear, all crimes: and this poor mother rears her child; and behold\na whole country rich and honest! Ah! I was a fool! I was absurd!\nwhat was that I was saying about denouncing myself? I really must pay\nattention and not be precipitate about anything. What! because it would\nhave pleased me to play the grand and generous; this is melodrama, after\nall; because I should have thought of no one but myself, the idea! for\nthe sake of saving from a punishment, a trifle exaggerated, perhaps,\nbut just at bottom, no one knows whom, a thief, a good-for-nothing,\nevidently, a whole country-side must perish! a poor woman must die in\nthe hospital! a poor little girl must die in the street! like dogs; ah,\nthis is abominable! And without the mother even having seen her child\nonce more, almost without the child's having known her mother; and\nall that for the sake of an old wretch of an apple-thief who, most\nassuredly, has deserved the galleys for something else, if not for\nthat; fine scruples, indeed, which save a guilty man and sacrifice the\ninnocent, which save an old vagabond who has only a few years to live at\nmost, and who will not be more unhappy in the galleys than in his hovel,\nand which sacrifice a whole population, mothers, wives, children. This\npoor little Cosette who has no one in the world but me, and who is, no\ndoubt, blue with cold at this moment in the den of those Thenardiers;\nthose peoples are rascals; and I was going to neglect my duty towards\nall these poor creatures; and I was going off to denounce myself; and I\nwas about to commit that unspeakable folly! Let us put it at the worst:\nsuppose that there is a wrong action on my part in this, and that my\nconscience will reproach me for it some day, to accept, for the good of\nothers, these reproaches which weigh only on myself; this evil action\nwhich compromises my soul alone; in that lies self-sacrifice; in that\nalone there is virtue.\"\n\nHe rose and resumed his march; this time, he seemed to be content.\n\nDiamonds are found only in the dark places of the earth; truths are\nfound only in the depths of thought. It seemed to him, that, after\nhaving descended into these depths, after having long groped among the\ndarkest of these shadows, he had at last found one of these diamonds,\none of these truths, and that he now held it in his hand, and he was\ndazzled as he gazed upon it.\n\n\"Yes,\" he thought, \"this is right; I am on the right road; I have the\nsolution; I must end by holding fast to something; my resolve is taken;\nlet things take their course; let us no longer vacillate; let us no\nlonger hang back; this is for the interest of all, not for my own; I am\nMadeleine, and Madeleine I remain. Woe to the man who is Jean Valjean!\nI am no longer he; I do not know that man; I no longer know anything; it\nturns out that some one is Jean Valjean at the present moment; let him\nlook out for himself; that does not concern me; it is a fatal name which\nwas floating abroad in the night; if it halts and descends on a head, so\nmuch the worse for that head.\"\n\nHe looked into the little mirror which hung above his chimney-piece, and\nsaid:--\n\n\"Hold! it has relieved me to come to a decision; I am quite another man\nnow.\"\n\nHe proceeded a few paces further, then he stopped short.\n\n\"Come!\" he said, \"I must not flinch before any of the consequences of\nthe resolution which I have once adopted; there are still threads which\nattach me to that Jean Valjean; they must be broken; in this very room\nthere are objects which would betray me, dumb things which would bear\nwitness against me; it is settled; all these things must disappear.\"\n\nHe fumbled in his pocket, drew out his purse, opened it, and took out a\nsmall key; he inserted the key in a lock whose aperture could hardly\nbe seen, so hidden was it in the most sombre tones of the design which\ncovered the wall-paper; a secret receptacle opened, a sort of\nfalse cupboard constructed in the angle between the wall and the\nchimney-piece; in this hiding-place there were some rags--a blue linen\nblouse, an old pair of trousers, an old knapsack, and a huge thorn\ncudgel shod with iron at both ends. Those who had seen Jean Valjean at\nthe epoch when he passed through D----in October, 1815, could easily\nhave recognized all the pieces of this miserable outfit.\n\nHe had preserved them as he had preserved the silver candlesticks, in\norder to remind himself continually of his starting-point, but he\nhad concealed all that came from the galleys, and he had allowed the\ncandlesticks which came from the Bishop to be seen.\n\nHe cast a furtive glance towards the door, as though he feared that it\nwould open in spite of the bolt which fastened it; then, with a quick\nand abrupt movement, he took the whole in his arms at once, without\nbestowing so much as a glance on the things which he had so religiously\nand so perilously preserved for so many years, and flung them all, rags,\ncudgel, knapsack, into the fire.\n\n[Illustration: Candlesticks Into the Fire  1b7-3-into-the-fire]\n\nHe closed the false cupboard again, and with redoubled precautions,\nhenceforth unnecessary, since it was now empty, he concealed the door\nbehind a heavy piece of furniture, which he pushed in front of it.\n\nAfter the lapse of a few seconds, the room and the opposite wall were\nlighted up with a fierce, red, tremulous glow. Everything was on fire;\nthe thorn cudgel snapped and threw out sparks to the middle of the\nchamber.\n\nAs the knapsack was consumed, together with the hideous rags which it\ncontained, it revealed something which sparkled in the ashes. By bending\nover, one could have readily recognized a coin,--no doubt the forty-sou\npiece stolen from the little Savoyard.\n\nHe did not look at the fire, but paced back and forth with the same\nstep.\n\nAll at once his eye fell on the two silver candlesticks, which shone\nvaguely on the chimney-piece, through the glow.\n\n\"Hold!\" he thought; \"the whole of Jean Valjean is still in them. They\nmust be destroyed also.\"\n\nHe seized the two candlesticks.\n\nThere was still fire enough to allow of their being put out of shape,\nand converted into a sort of unrecognizable bar of metal.\n\nHe bent over the hearth and warmed himself for a moment. He felt a sense\nof real comfort. \"How good warmth is!\" said he.\n\nHe stirred the live coals with one of the candlesticks.\n\nA minute more, and they were both in the fire.\n\nAt that moment it seemed to him that he heard a voice within him\nshouting: \"Jean Valjean! Jean Valjean!\"\n\nHis hair rose upright: he became like a man who is listening to some\nterrible thing.\n\n\"Yes, that's it! finish!\" said the voice. \"Complete what you are about!\nDestroy these candlesticks! Annihilate this souvenir! Forget the Bishop!\nForget everything! Destroy this Champmathieu, do! That is right! Applaud\nyourself! So it is settled, resolved, fixed, agreed: here is an old man\nwho does not know what is wanted of him, who has, perhaps, done nothing,\nan innocent man, whose whole misfortune lies in your name, upon whom\nyour name weighs like a crime, who is about to be taken for you, who\nwill be condemned, who will finish his days in abjectness and horror.\nThat is good! Be an honest man yourself; remain Monsieur le Maire;\nremain honorable and honored; enrich the town; nourish the indigent;\nrear the orphan; live happy, virtuous, and admired; and, during this\ntime, while you are here in the midst of joy and light, there will be a\nman who will wear your red blouse, who will bear your name in ignominy,\nand who will drag your chain in the galleys. Yes, it is well arranged\nthus. Ah, wretch!\"\n\nThe perspiration streamed from his brow. He fixed a haggard eye on the\ncandlesticks. But that within him which had spoken had not finished. The\nvoice continued:--\n\n\"Jean Valjean, there will be around you many voices, which will make a\ngreat noise, which will talk very loud, and which will bless you, and\nonly one which no one will hear, and which will curse you in the dark.\nWell! listen, infamous man! All those benedictions will fall back before\nthey reach heaven, and only the malediction will ascend to God.\"\n\nThis voice, feeble at first, and which had proceeded from the most\nobscure depths of his conscience, had gradually become startling and\nformidable, and he now heard it in his very ear. It seemed to him that\nit had detached itself from him, and that it was now speaking outside\nof him. He thought that he heard the last words so distinctly, that he\nglanced around the room in a sort of terror.\n\n\"Is there any one here?\" he demanded aloud, in utter bewilderment.\n\nThen he resumed, with a laugh which resembled that of an idiot:--\n\n\"How stupid I am! There can be no one!\"\n\nThere was some one; but the person who was there was of those whom the\nhuman eye cannot see.\n\nHe placed the candlesticks on the chimney-piece.\n\nThen he resumed his monotonous and lugubrious tramp, which troubled the\ndreams of the sleeping man beneath him, and awoke him with a start.\n\nThis tramping to and fro soothed and at the same time intoxicated him.\nIt sometimes seems, on supreme occasions, as though people moved about\nfor the purpose of asking advice of everything that they may encounter\nby change of place. After the lapse of a few minutes he no longer knew\nhis position.\n\nHe now recoiled in equal terror before both the resolutions at which he\nhad arrived in turn. The two ideas which counselled him appeared to him\nequally fatal. What a fatality! What conjunction that that Champmathieu\nshould have been taken for him; to be overwhelmed by precisely the means\nwhich Providence seemed to have employed, at first, to strengthen his\nposition!\n\nThere was a moment when he reflected on the future. Denounce himself,\ngreat God! Deliver himself up! With immense despair he faced all that\nhe should be obliged to leave, all that he should be obliged to take up\nonce more. He should have to bid farewell to that existence which was so\ngood, so pure, so radiant, to the respect of all, to honor, to liberty.\nHe should never more stroll in the fields; he should never more hear the\nbirds sing in the month of May; he should never more bestow alms on the\nlittle children; he should never more experience the sweetness of having\nglances of gratitude and love fixed upon him; he should quit that house\nwhich he had built, that little chamber! Everything seemed charming to\nhim at that moment. Never again should he read those books; never more\nshould he write on that little table of white wood; his old portress,\nthe only servant whom he kept, would never more bring him his coffee\nin the morning. Great God! instead of that, the convict gang, the iron\nnecklet, the red waistcoat, the chain on his ankle, fatigue, the cell,\nthe camp bed all those horrors which he knew so well! At his age,\nafter having been what he was! If he were only young again! but to\nbe addressed in his old age as \"thou\" by any one who pleased; to\nbe searched by the convict-guard; to receive the galley-sergeant's\ncudgellings; to wear iron-bound shoes on his bare feet; to have to\nstretch out his leg night and morning to the hammer of the roundsman who\nvisits the gang; to submit to the curiosity of strangers, who would be\ntold: \"That man yonder is the famous Jean Valjean, who was mayor of\nM. sur M.\"; and at night, dripping with perspiration, overwhelmed with\nlassitude, their green caps drawn over their eyes, to remount, two by\ntwo, the ladder staircase of the galleys beneath the sergeant's whip.\nOh, what misery! Can destiny, then, be as malicious as an intelligent\nbeing, and become as monstrous as the human heart?\n\nAnd do what he would, he always fell back upon the heartrending dilemma\nwhich lay at the foundation of his revery: \"Should he remain in paradise\nand become a demon? Should he return to hell and become an angel?\"\n\nWhat was to be done? Great God! what was to be done?\n\nThe torment from which he had escaped with so much difficulty was\nunchained afresh within him. His ideas began to grow confused once\nmore; they assumed a kind of stupefied and mechanical quality which is\npeculiar to despair. The name of Romainville recurred incessantly to his\nmind, with the two verses of a song which he had heard in the past.\nHe thought that Romainville was a little grove near Paris, where young\nlovers go to pluck lilacs in the month of April.\n\nHe wavered outwardly as well as inwardly. He walked like a little child\nwho is permitted to toddle alone.\n\nAt intervals, as he combated his lassitude, he made an effort to recover\nthe mastery of his mind. He tried to put to himself, for the last time,\nand definitely, the problem over which he had, in a manner, fallen\nprostrate with fatigue: Ought he to denounce himself? Ought he to hold\nhis peace? He could not manage to see anything distinctly. The vague\naspects of all the courses of reasoning which had been sketched out by\nhis meditations quivered and vanished, one after the other, into smoke.\nHe only felt that, to whatever course of action he made up his mind,\nsomething in him must die, and that of necessity, and without his being\nable to escape the fact; that he was entering a sepulchre on the\nright hand as much as on the left; that he was passing through a death\nagony,--the agony of his happiness, or the agony of his virtue.\n\nAlas! all his resolution had again taken possession of him. He was no\nfurther advanced than at the beginning.\n\nThus did this unhappy soul struggle in its anguish. Eighteen hundred\nyears before this unfortunate man, the mysterious Being in whom are\nsummed up all the sanctities and all the sufferings of humanity had also\nlong thrust aside with his hand, while the olive-trees quivered in\nthe wild wind of the infinite, the terrible cup which appeared to Him\ndripping with darkness and overflowing with shadows in the depths all\nstudded with stars.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV--FORMS ASSUMED BY SUFFERING DURING SLEEP\n\nThree o'clock in the morning had just struck, and he had been walking\nthus for five hours, almost uninterruptedly, when he at length allowed\nhimself to drop into his chair.\n\nThere he fell asleep and had a dream.\n\nThis dream, like the majority of dreams, bore no relation to the\nsituation, except by its painful and heart-rending character, but it\nmade an impression on him. This nightmare struck him so forcibly that he\nwrote it down later on. It is one of the papers in his own handwriting\nwhich he has bequeathed to us. We think that we have here reproduced the\nthing in strict accordance with the text.\n\nOf whatever nature this dream may be, the history of this night would\nbe incomplete if we were to omit it: it is the gloomy adventure of an\nailing soul.\n\nHere it is. On the envelope we find this line inscribed, \"The Dream I\nhad that Night.\"\n\n\"I was in a plain; a vast, gloomy plain, where there was no grass. It\ndid not seem to me to be daylight nor yet night.\n\n\"I was walking with my brother, the brother of my childish years,\nthe brother of whom, I must say, I never think, and whom I now hardly\nremember.\n\n\"We were conversing and we met some passers-by. We were talking of a\nneighbor of ours in former days, who had always worked with her window\nopen from the time when she came to live on the street. As we talked we\nfelt cold because of that open window.\n\n\"There were no trees in the plain. We saw a man passing close to us. He\nwas entirely nude, of the hue of ashes, and mounted on a horse which was\nearth color. The man had no hair; we could see his skull and the veins\non it. In his hand he held a switch which was as supple as a vine-shoot\nand as heavy as iron. This horseman passed and said nothing to us.\n\n\"My brother said to me, 'Let us take to the hollow road.'\n\n\"There existed a hollow way wherein one saw neither a single shrub nor\na spear of moss. Everything was dirt-colored, even the sky. After\nproceeding a few paces, I received no reply when I spoke: I perceived\nthat my brother was no longer with me.\n\n\"I entered a village which I espied. I reflected that it must be\nRomainville. (Why Romainville?)[5]\n\n\"The first street that I entered was deserted. I entered a second\nstreet. Behind the angle formed by the two streets, a man was standing\nerect against the wall. I said to this Man:--\n\n\"'What country is this? Where am I?' The man made no reply. I saw the\ndoor of a house open, and I entered.\n\n\"The first chamber was deserted. I entered the second. Behind the door\nof this chamber a man was standing erect against the wall. I inquired of\nthis man, 'Whose house is this? Where am I?' The man replied not.\n\n\"The house had a garden. I quitted the house and entered the garden.\nThe garden was deserted. Behind the first tree I found a man standing\nupright. I said to this man, 'What garden is this? Where am I?' The man\ndid not answer.\n\n\"I strolled into the village, and perceived that it was a town. All\nthe streets were deserted, all the doors were open. Not a single living\nbeing was passing in the streets, walking through the chambers or\nstrolling in the gardens. But behind each angle of the walls, behind\neach door, behind each tree, stood a silent man. Only one was to be seen\nat a time. These men watched me pass.\n\n\"I left the town and began to ramble about the fields.\n\n\"After the lapse of some time I turned back and saw a great crowd coming\nup behind me. I recognized all the men whom I had seen in that town.\nThey had strange heads. They did not seem to be in a hurry, yet they\nwalked faster than I did. They made no noise as they walked. In an\ninstant this crowd had overtaken and surrounded me. The faces of these\nmen were earthen in hue.\n\n\"Then the first one whom I had seen and questioned on entering the town\nsaid to me:--\n\n\"'Whither are you going! Do you not know that you have been dead this\nlong time?'\n\n\"I opened my mouth to reply, and I perceived that there was no one near\nme.\"\n\n\nHe woke. He was icy cold. A wind which was chill like the breeze of dawn\nwas rattling the leaves of the window, which had been left open on their\nhinges. The fire was out. The candle was nearing its end. It was still\nblack night.\n\nHe rose, he went to the window. There were no stars in the sky even yet.\n\nFrom his window the yard of the house and the street were visible. A\nsharp, harsh noise, which made him drop his eyes, resounded from the\nearth.\n\nBelow him he perceived two red stars, whose rays lengthened and\nshortened in a singular manner through the darkness.\n\nAs his thoughts were still half immersed in the mists of sleep, \"Hold!\"\nsaid he, \"there are no stars in the sky. They are on earth now.\"\n\nBut this confusion vanished; a second sound similar to the first roused\nhim thoroughly; he looked and recognized the fact that these two stars\nwere the lanterns of a carriage. By the light which they cast he was\nable to distinguish the form of this vehicle. It was a tilbury harnessed\nto a small white horse. The noise which he had heard was the trampling\nof the horse's hoofs on the pavement.\n\n\"What vehicle is this?\" he said to himself. \"Who is coming here so early\nin the morning?\"\n\nAt that moment there came a light tap on the door of his chamber.\n\nHe shuddered from head to foot, and cried in a terrible voice:--\n\n\"Who is there?\"\n\nSome one said:--\n\n\"I, Monsieur le Maire.\"\n\nHe recognized the voice of the old woman who was his portress.\n\n\"Well!\" he replied, \"what is it?\"\n\n\"Monsieur le Maire, it is just five o'clock in the morning.\"\n\n\"What is that to me?\"\n\n\"The cabriolet is here, Monsieur le Maire.\"\n\n\"What cabriolet?\"\n\n\"The tilbury.\"\n\n\"What tilbury?\"\n\n\"Did not Monsieur le Maire order a tilbury?\"\n\n\"No,\" said he.\n\n\"The coachman says that he has come for Monsieur le Maire.\"\n\n\"What coachman?\"\n\n\"M. Scaufflaire's coachman.\"\n\n\"M. Scaufflaire?\"\n\nThat name sent a shudder over him, as though a flash of lightning had\npassed in front of his face.\n\n\"Ah! yes,\" he resumed; \"M. Scaufflaire!\"\n\nIf the old woman could have seen him at that moment, she would have been\nfrightened.\n\nA tolerably long silence ensued. He examined the flame of the candle\nwith a stupid air, and from around the wick he took some of the burning\nwax, which he rolled between his fingers. The old woman waited for him.\nShe even ventured to uplift her voice once more:--\n\n\"What am I to say, Monsieur le Maire?\"\n\n\"Say that it is well, and that I am coming down.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V--HINDRANCES\n\nThe posting service from Arras to M. sur M. was still operated at this\nperiod by small mail-wagons of the time of the Empire. These mail-wagons\nwere two-wheeled cabriolets, upholstered inside with fawn-colored\nleather, hung on springs, and having but two seats, one for the postboy,\nthe other for the traveller. The wheels were armed with those long,\noffensive axles which keep other vehicles at a distance, and which\nmay still be seen on the road in Germany. The despatch box, an immense\noblong coffer, was placed behind the vehicle and formed a part of it.\nThis coffer was painted black, and the cabriolet yellow.\n\nThese vehicles, which have no counterparts nowadays, had something\ndistorted and hunchbacked about them; and when one saw them passing in\nthe distance, and climbing up some road to the horizon, they resembled\nthe insects which are called, I think, termites, and which, though with\nbut little corselet, drag a great train behind them. But they travelled\nat a very rapid rate. The post-wagon which set out from Arras at one\no'clock every night, after the mail from Paris had passed, arrived at M.\nsur M. a little before five o'clock in the morning.\n\nThat night the wagon which was descending to M. sur M. by the Hesdin\nroad, collided at the corner of a street, just as it was entering the\ntown, with a little tilbury harnessed to a white horse, which was going\nin the opposite direction, and in which there was but one person, a man\nenveloped in a mantle. The wheel of the tilbury received quite a violent\nshock. The postman shouted to the man to stop, but the traveller paid no\nheed and pursued his road at full gallop.\n\n\"That man is in a devilish hurry!\" said the postman.\n\nThe man thus hastening on was the one whom we have just seen struggling\nin convulsions which are certainly deserving of pity.\n\nWhither was he going? He could not have told. Why was he hastening?\nHe did not know. He was driving at random, straight ahead. Whither?\nTo Arras, no doubt; but he might have been going elsewhere as well.\nAt times he was conscious of it, and he shuddered. He plunged into the\nnight as into a gulf. Something urged him forward; something drew him\non. No one could have told what was taking place within him; every one\nwill understand it. What man is there who has not entered, at least once\nin his life, into that obscure cavern of the unknown?\n\nHowever, he had resolved on nothing, decided nothing, formed no plan,\ndone nothing. None of the actions of his conscience had been decisive.\nHe was, more than ever, as he had been at the first moment.\n\nWhy was he going to Arras?\n\nHe repeated what he had already said to himself when he had hired\nScaufflaire's cabriolet: that, whatever the result was to be, there was\nno reason why he should not see with his own eyes, and judge of matters\nfor himself; that this was even prudent; that he must know what took\nplace; that no decision could be arrived at without having observed and\nscrutinized; that one made mountains out of everything from a distance;\nthat, at any rate, when he should have seen that Champmathieu, some\nwretch, his conscience would probably be greatly relieved to allow him\nto go to the galleys in his stead; that Javert would indeed be there;\nand that Brevet, that Chenildieu, that Cochepaille, old convicts who\nhad known him; but they certainly would not recognize him;--bah! what an\nidea! that Javert was a hundred leagues from suspecting the truth; that\nall conjectures and all suppositions were fixed on Champmathieu, and\nthat there is nothing so headstrong as suppositions and conjectures;\nthat accordingly there was no danger.\n\nThat it was, no doubt, a dark moment, but that he should emerge from it;\nthat, after all, he held his destiny, however bad it might be, in his\nown hand; that he was master of it. He clung to this thought.\n\nAt bottom, to tell the whole truth, he would have preferred not to go to\nArras.\n\nNevertheless, he was going thither.\n\nAs he meditated, he whipped up his horse, which was proceeding at that\nfine, regular, and even trot which accomplishes two leagues and a half\nan hour.\n\nIn proportion as the cabriolet advanced, he felt something within him\ndraw back.\n\nAt daybreak he was in the open country; the town of M. sur M. lay far\nbehind him. He watched the horizon grow white; he stared at all the\nchilly figures of a winter's dawn as they passed before his eyes,\nbut without seeing them. The morning has its spectres as well as the\nevening. He did not see them; but without his being aware of it, and by\nmeans of a sort of penetration which was almost physical, these black\nsilhouettes of trees and of hills added some gloomy and sinister quality\nto the violent state of his soul.\n\nEach time that he passed one of those isolated dwellings which sometimes\nborder on the highway, he said to himself, \"And yet there are people\nthere within who are sleeping!\"\n\nThe trot of the horse, the bells on the harness, the wheels on the road,\nproduced a gentle, monotonous noise. These things are charming when one\nis joyous, and lugubrious when one is sad.\n\nIt was broad daylight when he arrived at Hesdin. He halted in front of\nthe inn, to allow the horse a breathing spell, and to have him given\nsome oats.\n\nThe horse belonged, as Scaufflaire had said, to that small race of the\nBoulonnais, which has too much head, too much belly, and not enough neck\nand shoulders, but which has a broad chest, a large crupper, thin, fine\nlegs, and solid hoofs--a homely, but a robust and healthy race. The\nexcellent beast had travelled five leagues in two hours, and had not a\ndrop of sweat on his loins.\n\nHe did not get out of the tilbury. The stableman who brought the oats\nsuddenly bent down and examined the left wheel.\n\n\"Are you going far in this condition?\" said the man.\n\nHe replied, with an air of not having roused himself from his revery:--\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"Have you come from a great distance?\" went on the man.\n\n\"Five leagues.\"\n\n\"Ah!\"\n\n\"Why do you say, 'Ah?'\"\n\nThe man bent down once more, was silent for a moment, with his eyes\nfixed on the wheel; then he rose erect and said:--\n\n\"Because, though this wheel has travelled five leagues, it certainly\nwill not travel another quarter of a league.\"\n\nHe sprang out of the tilbury.\n\n\"What is that you say, my friend?\"\n\n\"I say that it is a miracle that you should have travelled five leagues\nwithout you and your horse rolling into some ditch on the highway. Just\nsee here!\"\n\nThe wheel really had suffered serious damage. The shock administered by\nthe mail-wagon had split two spokes and strained the hub, so that the\nnut no longer held firm.\n\n\"My friend,\" he said to the stableman, \"is there a wheelwright here?\"\n\n\"Certainly, sir.\"\n\n\"Do me the service to go and fetch him.\"\n\n\"He is only a step from here. Hey! Master Bourgaillard!\"\n\nMaster Bourgaillard, the wheelwright, was standing on his own threshold.\nHe came, examined the wheel and made a grimace like a surgeon when the\nlatter thinks a limb is broken.\n\n\"Can you repair this wheel immediately?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"When can I set out again?\"\n\n\"To-morrow.\"\n\n\"To-morrow!\"\n\n\"There is a long day's work on it. Are you in a hurry, sir?\"\n\n\"In a very great hurry. I must set out again in an hour at the latest.\"\n\n\"Impossible, sir.\"\n\n\"I will pay whatever you ask.\"\n\n\"Impossible.\"\n\n\"Well, in two hours, then.\"\n\n\"Impossible to-day. Two new spokes and a hub must be made. Monsieur will\nnot be able to start before to-morrow morning.\"\n\n\"The matter cannot wait until to-morrow. What if you were to replace\nthis wheel instead of repairing it?\"\n\n\"How so?\"\n\n\"You are a wheelwright?\"\n\n\"Certainly, sir.\"\n\n\"Have you not a wheel that you can sell me? Then I could start again at\nonce.\"\n\n\"A spare wheel?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"I have no wheel on hand that would fit your cabriolet. Two wheels make\na pair. Two wheels cannot be put together hap-hazard.\"\n\n\"In that case, sell me a pair of wheels.\"\n\n\"Not all wheels fit all axles, sir.\"\n\n\"Try, nevertheless.\"\n\n\"It is useless, sir. I have nothing to sell but cart-wheels. We are but\na poor country here.\"\n\n\"Have you a cabriolet that you can let me have?\"\n\nThe wheelwright had seen at the first glance that the tilbury was a\nhired vehicle. He shrugged his shoulders.\n\n\"You treat the cabriolets that people let you so well! If I had one, I\nwould not let it to you!\"\n\n\"Well, sell it to me, then.\"\n\n\"I have none.\"\n\n\"What! not even a spring-cart? I am not hard to please, as you see.\"\n\n\"We live in a poor country. There is, in truth,\" added the wheelwright,\n\"an old calash under the shed yonder, which belongs to a bourgeois of\nthe town, who gave it to me to take care of, and who only uses it on the\nthirty-sixth of the month--never, that is to say. I might let that\nto you, for what matters it to me? But the bourgeois must not see it\npass--and then, it is a calash; it would require two horses.\"\n\n\"I will take two post-horses.\"\n\n\"Where is Monsieur going?\"\n\n\"To Arras.\"\n\n\"And Monsieur wishes to reach there to-day?\"\n\n\"Yes, of course.\"\n\n\"By taking two post-horses?\"\n\n\"Why not?\"\n\n\"Does it make any difference whether Monsieur arrives at four o'clock\nto-morrow morning?\"\n\n\"Certainly not.\"\n\n\"There is one thing to be said about that, you see, by taking\npost-horses--Monsieur has his passport?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Well, by taking post-horses, Monsieur cannot reach Arras before\nto-morrow. We are on a cross-road. The relays are badly served, the\nhorses are in the fields. The season for ploughing is just beginning;\nheavy teams are required, and horses are seized upon everywhere, from\nthe post as well as elsewhere. Monsieur will have to wait three or four\nhours at the least at every relay. And, then, they drive at a walk.\nThere are many hills to ascend.\"\n\n\"Come then, I will go on horseback. Unharness the cabriolet. Some one\ncan surely sell me a saddle in the neighborhood.\"\n\n\"Without doubt. But will this horse bear the saddle?\"\n\n\"That is true; you remind me of that; he will not bear it.\"\n\n\"Then--\"\n\n\"But I can surely hire a horse in the village?\"\n\n\"A horse to travel to Arras at one stretch?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"That would require such a horse as does not exist in these parts. You\nwould have to buy it to begin with, because no one knows you. But you\nwill not find one for sale nor to let, for five hundred francs, or for a\nthousand.\"\n\n\"What am I to do?\"\n\n\"The best thing is to let me repair the wheel like an honest man, and\nset out on your journey to-morrow.\"\n\n\"To-morrow will be too late.\"\n\n\"The deuce!\"\n\n\"Is there not a mail-wagon which runs to Arras? When will it pass?\"\n\n\"To-night. Both the posts pass at night; the one going as well as the\none coming.\"\n\n\"What! It will take you a day to mend this wheel?\"\n\n\"A day, and a good long one.\"\n\n\"If you set two men to work?\"\n\n\"If I set ten men to work.\"\n\n\"What if the spokes were to be tied together with ropes?\"\n\n\"That could be done with the spokes, not with the hub; and the felly is\nin a bad state, too.\"\n\n\"Is there any one in this village who lets out teams?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Is there another wheelwright?\"\n\nThe stableman and the wheelwright replied in concert, with a toss of the\nhead.\n\n\"No.\"\n\nHe felt an immense joy.\n\nIt was evident that Providence was intervening. That it was it who had\nbroken the wheel of the tilbury and who was stopping him on the road.\nHe had not yielded to this sort of first summons; he had just made every\npossible effort to continue the journey; he had loyally and scrupulously\nexhausted all means; he had been deterred neither by the season, nor\nfatigue, nor by the expense; he had nothing with which to reproach\nhimself. If he went no further, that was no fault of his. It did not\nconcern him further. It was no longer his fault. It was not the act of\nhis own conscience, but the act of Providence.\n\nHe breathed again. He breathed freely and to the full extent of his\nlungs for the first time since Javert's visit. It seemed to him that the\nhand of iron which had held his heart in its grasp for the last twenty\nhours had just released him.\n\nIt seemed to him that God was for him now, and was manifesting Himself.\n\nHe said himself that he had done all he could, and that now he had\nnothing to do but retrace his steps quietly.\n\nIf his conversation with the wheelwright had taken place in a chamber\nof the inn, it would have had no witnesses, no one would have heard him,\nthings would have rested there, and it is probable that we should not\nhave had to relate any of the occurrences which the reader is about\nto peruse; but this conversation had taken place in the street. Any\ncolloquy in the street inevitably attracts a crowd. There are always\npeople who ask nothing better than to become spectators. While he was\nquestioning the wheelwright, some people who were passing back and forth\nhalted around them. After listening for a few minutes, a young lad, to\nwhom no one had paid any heed, detached himself from the group and ran\noff.\n\nAt the moment when the traveller, after the inward deliberation which we\nhave just described, resolved to retrace his steps, this child returned.\nHe was accompanied by an old woman.\n\n\"Monsieur,\" said the woman, \"my boy tells me that you wish to hire a\ncabriolet.\"\n\nThese simple words uttered by an old woman led by a child made the\nperspiration trickle down his limbs. He thought that he beheld the hand\nwhich had relaxed its grasp reappear in the darkness behind him, ready\nto seize him once more.\n\nHe answered:--\n\n\"Yes, my good woman; I am in search of a cabriolet which I can hire.\"\n\nAnd he hastened to add:--\n\n\"But there is none in the place.\"\n\n\"Certainly there is,\" said the old woman.\n\n\"Where?\" interpolated the wheelwright.\n\n\"At my house,\" replied the old woman.\n\nHe shuddered. The fatal hand had grasped him again.\n\nThe old woman really had in her shed a sort of basket spring-cart.\nThe wheelwright and the stable-man, in despair at the prospect of the\ntraveller escaping their clutches, interfered.\n\n\"It was a frightful old trap; it rests flat on the axle; it is an actual\nfact that the seats were suspended inside it by leather thongs; the rain\ncame into it; the wheels were rusted and eaten with moisture; it\nwould not go much further than the tilbury; a regular ramshackle old\nstage-wagon; the gentleman would make a great mistake if he trusted\nhimself to it,\" etc., etc.\n\nAll this was true; but this trap, this ramshackle old vehicle, this\nthing, whatever it was, ran on its two wheels and could go to Arras.\n\nHe paid what was asked, left the tilbury with the wheelwright to be\nrepaired, intending to reclaim it on his return, had the white horse\nput to the cart, climbed into it, and resumed the road which he had been\ntravelling since morning.\n\nAt the moment when the cart moved off, he admitted that he had felt, a\nmoment previously, a certain joy in the thought that he should not\ngo whither he was now proceeding. He examined this joy with a sort of\nwrath, and found it absurd. Why should he feel joy at turning back?\nAfter all, he was taking this trip of his own free will. No one was\nforcing him to it.\n\nAnd assuredly nothing would happen except what he should choose.\n\nAs he left Hesdin, he heard a voice shouting to him: \"Stop! Stop!\" He\nhalted the cart with a vigorous movement which contained a feverish and\nconvulsive element resembling hope.\n\nIt was the old woman's little boy.\n\n\"Monsieur,\" said the latter, \"it was I who got the cart for you.\"\n\n\"Well?\"\n\n\"You have not given me anything.\"\n\nHe who gave to all so readily thought this demand exorbitant and almost\nodious.\n\n\"Ah! it's you, you scamp?\" said he; \"you shall have nothing.\"\n\nHe whipped up his horse and set off at full speed.\n\nHe had lost a great deal of time at Hesdin. He wanted to make it good.\nThe little horse was courageous, and pulled for two; but it was the\nmonth of February, there had been rain; the roads were bad. And then,\nit was no longer the tilbury. The cart was very heavy, and in addition,\nthere were many ascents.\n\nHe took nearly four hours to go from Hesdin to Saint-Pol; four hours for\nfive leagues.\n\nAt Saint-Pol he had the horse unharnessed at the first inn he came to\nand led to the stable; as he had promised Scaufflaire, he stood beside\nthe manger while the horse was eating; he thought of sad and confusing\nthings.\n\nThe inn-keeper's wife came to the stable.\n\n\"Does not Monsieur wish to breakfast?\"\n\n\"Come, that is true; I even have a good appetite.\"\n\nHe followed the woman, who had a rosy, cheerful face; she led him to the\npublic room where there were tables covered with waxed cloth.\n\n\"Make haste!\" said he; \"I must start again; I am in a hurry.\"\n\nA big Flemish servant-maid placed his knife and fork in all haste; he\nlooked at the girl with a sensation of comfort.\n\n\"That is what ailed me,\" he thought; \"I had not breakfasted.\"\n\nHis breakfast was served; he seized the bread, took a mouthful, and then\nslowly replaced it on the table, and did not touch it again.\n\nA carter was eating at another table; he said to this man:--\n\n\"Why is their bread so bitter here?\"\n\nThe carter was a German and did not understand him.\n\nHe returned to the stable and remained near the horse.\n\nAn hour later he had quitted Saint-Pol and was directing his course\ntowards Tinques, which is only five leagues from Arras.\n\nWhat did he do during this journey? Of what was he thinking? As in the\nmorning, he watched the trees, the thatched roofs, the tilled fields\npass by, and the way in which the landscape, broken at every turn of the\nroad, vanished; this is a sort of contemplation which sometimes\nsuffices to the soul, and almost relieves it from thought. What is more\nmelancholy and more profound than to see a thousand objects for the\nfirst and the last time? To travel is to be born and to die at every\ninstant; perhaps, in the vaguest region of his mind, he did make\ncomparisons between the shifting horizon and our human existence: all\nthe things of life are perpetually fleeing before us; the dark and\nbright intervals are intermingled; after a dazzling moment, an eclipse;\nwe look, we hasten, we stretch out our hands to grasp what is passing;\neach event is a turn in the road, and, all at once, we are old; we feel\na shock; all is black; we distinguish an obscure door; the gloomy\nhorse of life, which has been drawing us halts, and we see a veiled and\nunknown person unharnessing amid the shadows.\n\nTwilight was falling when the children who were coming out of school\nbeheld this traveller enter Tinques; it is true that the days were still\nshort; he did not halt at Tinques; as he emerged from the village, a\nlaborer, who was mending the road with stones, raised his head and said\nto him:--\n\n\"That horse is very much fatigued.\"\n\nThe poor beast was, in fact, going at a walk.\n\n\"Are you going to Arras?\" added the road-mender.\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"If you go on at that rate you will not arrive very early.\"\n\nHe stopped his horse, and asked the laborer:--\n\n\"How far is it from here to Arras?\"\n\n\"Nearly seven good leagues.\"\n\n\"How is that? the posting guide only says five leagues and a quarter.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" returned the road-mender, \"so you don't know that the road is\nunder repair? You will find it barred a quarter of an hour further on;\nthere is no way to proceed further.\"\n\n\"Really?\"\n\n\"You will take the road on the left, leading to Carency; you will cross\nthe river; when you reach Camblin, you will turn to the right; that is\nthe road to Mont-Saint-Eloy which leads to Arras.\"\n\n\"But it is night, and I shall lose my way.\"\n\n\"You do not belong in these parts?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"And, besides, it is all cross-roads; stop! sir,\" resumed the\nroad-mender; \"shall I give you a piece of advice? your horse is tired;\nreturn to Tinques; there is a good inn there; sleep there; you can reach\nArras to-morrow.\"\n\n\"I must be there this evening.\"\n\n\"That is different; but go to the inn all the same, and get an extra\nhorse; the stable-boy will guide you through the cross-roads.\"\n\nHe followed the road-mender's advice, retraced his steps, and, half an\nhour later, he passed the same spot again, but this time at full speed,\nwith a good horse to aid; a stable-boy, who called himself a postilion,\nwas seated on the shaft of the cariole.\n\nStill, he felt that he had lost time.\n\nNight had fully come.\n\nThey turned into the cross-road; the way became frightfully bad; the\ncart lurched from one rut to the other; he said to the postilion:--\n\n\"Keep at a trot, and you shall have a double fee.\"\n\nIn one of the jolts, the whiffle-tree broke.\n\n\"There's the whiffle-tree broken, sir,\" said the postilion; \"I don't\nknow how to harness my horse now; this road is very bad at night; if\nyou wish to return and sleep at Tinques, we could be in Arras early\nto-morrow morning.\"\n\nHe replied, \"Have you a bit of rope and a knife?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\nHe cut a branch from a tree and made a whiffle-tree of it.\n\nThis caused another loss of twenty minutes; but they set out again at a\ngallop.\n\nThe plain was gloomy; low-hanging, black, crisp fogs crept over the\nhills and wrenched themselves away like smoke: there were whitish gleams\nin the clouds; a strong breeze which blew in from the sea produced a\nsound in all quarters of the horizon, as of some one moving furniture;\neverything that could be seen assumed attitudes of terror. How many\nthings shiver beneath these vast breaths of the night!\n\nHe was stiff with cold; he had eaten nothing since the night before;\nhe vaguely recalled his other nocturnal trip in the vast plain in\nthe neighborhood of D----, eight years previously, and it seemed but\nyesterday.\n\nThe hour struck from a distant tower; he asked the boy:--\n\n\"What time is it?\"\n\n\"Seven o'clock, sir; we shall reach Arras at eight; we have but three\nleagues still to go.\"\n\nAt that moment, he for the first time indulged in this reflection,\nthinking it odd the while that it had not occurred to him sooner: that\nall this trouble which he was taking was, perhaps, useless; that he did\nnot know so much as the hour of the trial; that he should, at least,\nhave informed himself of that; that he was foolish to go thus straight\nahead without knowing whether he would be of any service or not; then\nhe sketched out some calculations in his mind: that, ordinarily, the\nsittings of the Court of Assizes began at nine o'clock in the morning;\nthat it could not be a long affair; that the theft of the apples would\nbe very brief; that there would then remain only a question of identity,\nfour or five depositions, and very little for the lawyers to say; that\nhe should arrive after all was over.\n\nThe postilion whipped up the horses; they had crossed the river and left\nMont-Saint-Eloy behind them.\n\nThe night grew more profound.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI--SISTER SIMPLICE PUT TO THE PROOF\n\nBut at that moment Fantine was joyous.\n\nShe had passed a very bad night; her cough was frightful; her fever\nhad doubled in intensity; she had had dreams: in the morning, when the\ndoctor paid his visit, she was delirious; he assumed an alarmed look,\nand ordered that he should be informed as soon as M. Madeleine arrived.\n\nAll the morning she was melancholy, said but little, and laid plaits\nin her sheets, murmuring the while, in a low voice, calculations\nwhich seemed to be calculations of distances. Her eyes were hollow and\nstaring. They seemed almost extinguished at intervals, then lighted up\nagain and shone like stars. It seems as though, at the approach of a\ncertain dark hour, the light of heaven fills those who are quitting the\nlight of earth.\n\nEach time that Sister Simplice asked her how she felt, she replied\ninvariably, \"Well. I should like to see M. Madeleine.\"\n\nSome months before this, at the moment when Fantine had just lost her\nlast modesty, her last shame, and her last joy, she was the shadow of\nherself; now she was the spectre of herself. Physical suffering had\ncompleted the work of moral suffering. This creature of five and twenty\nhad a wrinkled brow, flabby cheeks, pinched nostrils, teeth from which\nthe gums had receded, a leaden complexion, a bony neck, prominent\nshoulder-blades, frail limbs, a clayey skin, and her golden hair was\ngrowing out sprinkled with gray. Alas! how illness improvises old-age!\n\nAt mid-day the physician returned, gave some directions, inquired\nwhether the mayor had made his appearance at the infirmary, and shook\nhis head.\n\nM. Madeleine usually came to see the invalid at three o'clock. As\nexactness is kindness, he was exact.\n\nAbout half-past two, Fantine began to be restless. In the course of\ntwenty minutes, she asked the nun more than ten times, \"What time is it,\nsister?\"\n\nThree o'clock struck. At the third stroke, Fantine sat up in bed; she\nwho could, in general, hardly turn over, joined her yellow, fleshless\nhands in a sort of convulsive clasp, and the nun heard her utter one\nof those profound sighs which seem to throw off dejection. Then Fantine\nturned and looked at the door.\n\nNo one entered; the door did not open.\n\nShe remained thus for a quarter of an hour, her eyes riveted on the\ndoor, motionless and apparently holding her breath. The sister dared not\nspeak to her. The clock struck a quarter past three. Fantine fell back\non her pillow.\n\nShe said nothing, but began to plait the sheets once more.\n\nHalf an hour passed, then an hour, no one came; every time the clock\nstruck, Fantine started up and looked towards the door, then fell back\nagain.\n\nHer thought was clearly perceptible, but she uttered no name, she made\nno complaint, she blamed no one. But she coughed in a melancholy way.\nOne would have said that something dark was descending upon her. She was\nlivid and her lips were blue. She smiled now and then.\n\nFive o'clock struck. Then the sister heard her say, very low and gently,\n\"He is wrong not to come to-day, since I am going away to-morrow.\"\n\nSister Simplice herself was surprised at M. Madeleine's delay.\n\nIn the meantime, Fantine was staring at the tester of her bed. She\nseemed to be endeavoring to recall something. All at once she began to\nsing in a voice as feeble as a breath. The nun listened. This is what\nFantine was singing:--\n\n\n          \"Lovely things we will buy\n           As we stroll the faubourgs through.\n           Roses are pink, corn-flowers are blue,\n           I love my love, corn-flowers are blue.\n\n\n\"Yestere'en the Virgin Mary came near my stove, in a broidered mantle\nclad, and said to me, 'Here, hide 'neath my veil the child whom you\none day begged from me. Haste to the city, buy linen, buy a needle, buy\nthread.'\n\n\n          \"Lovely things we will buy\n           As we stroll the faubourgs through.\n\n\n\"Dear Holy Virgin, beside my stove I have set a cradle with ribbons\ndecked. God may give me his loveliest star; I prefer the child thou hast\ngranted me. 'Madame, what shall I do with this linen fine?'--'Make of it\nclothes for thy new-born babe.'\n\n\n          \"Roses are pink and corn-flowers are blue,\n           I love my love, and corn-flowers are blue.\n\n\n\"'Wash this linen.'--'Where?'--'In the stream. Make of it, soiling\nnot, spoiling not, a petticoat fair with its bodice fine, which I will\nembroider and fill with flowers.'--'Madame, the child is no longer here;\nwhat is to be done?'--'Then make of it a winding-sheet in which to bury\nme.'\n\n\n          \"Lovely things we will buy\n           As we stroll the faubourgs through,\n           Roses are pink, corn-flowers are blue,\n           I love my love, corn-flowers are blue.\"\n\n\nThis song was an old cradle romance with which she had, in former days,\nlulled her little Cosette to sleep, and which had never recurred to her\nmind in all the five years during which she had been parted from her\nchild. She sang it in so sad a voice, and to so sweet an air, that it\nwas enough to make any one, even a nun, weep. The sister, accustomed as\nshe was to austerities, felt a tear spring to her eyes.\n\nThe clock struck six. Fantine did not seem to hear it. She no longer\nseemed to pay attention to anything about her.\n\nSister Simplice sent a serving-maid to inquire of the portress of the\nfactory, whether the mayor had returned, and if he would not come to the\ninfirmary soon. The girl returned in a few minutes.\n\nFantine was still motionless and seemed absorbed in her own thoughts.\n\nThe servant informed Sister Simplice in a very low tone, that the\nmayor had set out that morning before six o'clock, in a little tilbury\nharnessed to a white horse, cold as the weather was; that he had gone\nalone, without even a driver; that no one knew what road he had taken;\nthat people said he had been seen to turn into the road to Arras; that\nothers asserted that they had met him on the road to Paris. That when he\nwent away he had been very gentle, as usual, and that he had merely told\nthe portress not to expect him that night.\n\nWhile the two women were whispering together, with their backs turned\nto Fantine's bed, the sister interrogating, the servant conjecturing,\nFantine, with the feverish vivacity of certain organic maladies, which\nunite the free movements of health with the frightful emaciation of\ndeath, had raised herself to her knees in bed, with her shrivelled hands\nresting on the bolster, and her head thrust through the opening of the\ncurtains, and was listening. All at once she cried:--\n\n\"You are speaking of M. Madeleine! Why are you talking so low? What is\nhe doing? Why does he not come?\"\n\nHer voice was so abrupt and hoarse that the two women thought they heard\nthe voice of a man; they wheeled round in affright.\n\n\"Answer me!\" cried Fantine.\n\nThe servant stammered:--\n\n\"The portress told me that he could not come to-day.\"\n\n\"Be calm, my child,\" said the sister; \"lie down again.\"\n\nFantine, without changing her attitude, continued in a loud voice, and\nwith an accent that was both imperious and heart-rending:--\n\n\"He cannot come? Why not? You know the reason. You are whispering it to\neach other there. I want to know it.\"\n\nThe servant-maid hastened to say in the nun's ear, \"Say that he is busy\nwith the city council.\"\n\nSister Simplice blushed faintly, for it was a lie that the maid had\nproposed to her.\n\nOn the other hand, it seemed to her that the mere communication of the\ntruth to the invalid would, without doubt, deal her a terrible blow, and\nthat this was a serious matter in Fantine's present state. Her flush\ndid not last long; the sister raised her calm, sad eyes to Fantine, and\nsaid, \"Monsieur le Maire has gone away.\"\n\nFantine raised herself and crouched on her heels in the bed: her eyes\nsparkled; indescribable joy beamed from that melancholy face.\n\n\"Gone!\" she cried; \"he has gone to get Cosette.\"\n\nThen she raised her arms to heaven, and her white face became ineffable;\nher lips moved; she was praying in a low voice.\n\nWhen her prayer was finished, \"Sister,\" she said, \"I am willing to lie\ndown again; I will do anything you wish; I was naughty just now; I beg\nyour pardon for having spoken so loud; it is very wrong to talk loudly;\nI know that well, my good sister, but, you see, I am very happy: the\ngood God is good; M. Madeleine is good; just think! he has gone to\nMontfermeil to get my little Cosette.\"\n\nShe lay down again, with the nun's assistance, helped the nun to arrange\nher pillow, and kissed the little silver cross which she wore on her\nneck, and which Sister Simplice had given her.\n\n\"My child,\" said the sister, \"try to rest now, and do not talk any\nmore.\"\n\nFantine took the sister's hand in her moist hands, and the latter was\npained to feel that perspiration.\n\n\"He set out this morning for Paris; in fact, he need not even go through\nParis; Montfermeil is a little to the left as you come thence. Do you\nremember how he said to me yesterday, when I spoke to him of Cosette,\nSoon, soon? He wants to give me a surprise, you know! he made me sign a\nletter so that she could be taken from the Thenardiers; they cannot\nsay anything, can they? they will give back Cosette, for they have been\npaid; the authorities will not allow them to keep the child since they\nhave received their pay. Do not make signs to me that I must not talk,\nsister! I am extremely happy; I am doing well; I am not ill at all any\nmore; I am going to see Cosette again; I am even quite hungry; it is\nnearly five years since I saw her last; you cannot imagine how much\nattached one gets to children, and then, she will be so pretty; you will\nsee! If you only knew what pretty little rosy fingers she had! In the\nfirst place, she will have very beautiful hands; she had ridiculous\nhands when she was only a year old; like this! she must be a big girl\nnow; she is seven years old; she is quite a young lady; I call her\nCosette, but her name is really Euphrasie. Stop! this morning I was\nlooking at the dust on the chimney-piece, and I had a sort of idea come\nacross me, like that, that I should see Cosette again soon. Mon Dieu!\nhow wrong it is not to see one's children for years! One ought to\nreflect that life is not eternal. Oh, how good M. le Maire is to go! it\nis very cold! it is true; he had on his cloak, at least? he will be\nhere to-morrow, will he not? to-morrow will be a festival day; to-morrow\nmorning, sister, you must remind me to put on my little cap that has\nlace on it. What a place that Montfermeil is! I took that journey on\nfoot once; it was very long for me, but the diligences go very quickly!\nhe will be here to-morrow with Cosette: how far is it from here to\nMontfermeil?\"\n\nThe sister, who had no idea of distances, replied, \"Oh, I think that he\nwill be here to-morrow.\"\n\n\"To-morrow! to-morrow!\" said Fantine, \"I shall see Cosette to-morrow!\nyou see, good sister of the good God, that I am no longer ill; I am mad;\nI could dance if any one wished it.\"\n\nA person who had seen her a quarter of an hour previously would not have\nunderstood the change; she was all rosy now; she spoke in a lively and\nnatural voice; her whole face was one smile; now and then she talked,\nshe laughed softly; the joy of a mother is almost infantile.\n\n\"Well,\" resumed the nun, \"now that you are happy, mind me, and do not\ntalk any more.\"\n\nFantine laid her head on her pillow and said in a low voice: \"Yes,\nlie down again; be good, for you are going to have your child; Sister\nSimplice is right; every one here is right.\"\n\nAnd then, without stirring, without even moving her head, she began to\nstare all about her with wide-open eyes and a joyous air, and she said\nnothing more.\n\nThe sister drew the curtains together again, hoping that she would\nfall into a doze. Between seven and eight o'clock the doctor came; not\nhearing any sound, he thought Fantine was asleep, entered softly, and\napproached the bed on tiptoe; he opened the curtains a little, and, by\nthe light of the taper, he saw Fantine's big eyes gazing at him.\n\nShe said to him, \"She will be allowed to sleep beside me in a little\nbed, will she not, sir?\"\n\nThe doctor thought that she was delirious. She added:--\n\n\"See! there is just room.\"\n\nThe doctor took Sister Simplice aside, and she explained matters to him;\nthat M. Madeleine was absent for a day or two, and that in their doubt\nthey had not thought it well to undeceive the invalid, who believed that\nthe mayor had gone to Montfermeil; that it was possible, after all, that\nher guess was correct: the doctor approved.\n\nHe returned to Fantine's bed, and she went on:--\n\n\"You see, when she wakes up in the morning, I shall be able to say good\nmorning to her, poor kitten, and when I cannot sleep at night, I can\nhear her asleep; her little gentle breathing will do me good.\"\n\n\"Give me your hand,\" said the doctor.\n\nShe stretched out her arm, and exclaimed with a laugh:--\n\n\"Ah, hold! in truth, you did not know it; I am cured; Cosette will\narrive to-morrow.\"\n\nThe doctor was surprised; she was better; the pressure on her chest\nhad decreased; her pulse had regained its strength; a sort of life had\nsuddenly supervened and reanimated this poor, worn-out creature.\n\n\"Doctor,\" she went on, \"did the sister tell you that M. le Maire has\ngone to get that mite of a child?\"\n\nThe doctor recommended silence, and that all painful emotions should be\navoided; he prescribed an infusion of pure chinchona, and, in case the\nfever should increase again during the night, a calming potion. As he\ntook his departure, he said to the sister:--\n\n\"She is doing better; if good luck willed that the mayor should\nactually arrive to-morrow with the child, who knows? there are crises\nso astounding; great joy has been known to arrest maladies; I know well\nthat this is an organic disease, and in an advanced state, but all those\nthings are such mysteries: we may be able to save her.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII--THE TRAVELLER ON HIS ARRIVAL TAKES PRECAUTIONS FOR\nDEPARTURE\n\nIt was nearly eight o'clock in the evening when the cart, which we\nleft on the road, entered the porte-cochere of the Hotel de la Poste in\nArras; the man whom we have been following up to this moment alighted\nfrom it, responded with an abstracted air to the attentions of the\npeople of the inn, sent back the extra horse, and with his own hands\nled the little white horse to the stable; then he opened the door of a\nbilliard-room which was situated on the ground floor, sat down there,\nand leaned his elbows on a table; he had taken fourteen hours for\nthe journey which he had counted on making in six; he did himself the\njustice to acknowledge that it was not his fault, but at bottom, he was\nnot sorry.\n\nThe landlady of the hotel entered.\n\n\"Does Monsieur wish a bed? Does Monsieur require supper?\"\n\nHe made a sign of the head in the negative.\n\n\"The stableman says that Monsieur's horse is extremely fatigued.\"\n\nHere he broke his silence.\n\n\"Will not the horse be in a condition to set out again to-morrow\nmorning?\"\n\n\"Oh, Monsieur! he must rest for two days at least.\"\n\nHe inquired:--\n\n\"Is not the posting-station located here?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\nThe hostess conducted him to the office; he showed his passport, and\ninquired whether there was any way of returning that same night to M.\nsur M. by the mail-wagon; the seat beside the post-boy chanced to be\nvacant; he engaged it and paid for it. \"Monsieur,\" said the clerk,\n\"do not fail to be here ready to start at precisely one o'clock in the\nmorning.\"\n\nThis done, he left the hotel and began to wander about the town.\n\nHe was not acquainted with Arras; the streets were dark, and he\nwalked on at random; but he seemed bent upon not asking the way of the\npassers-by. He crossed the little river Crinchon, and found himself in a\nlabyrinth of narrow alleys where he lost his way. A citizen was passing\nalong with a lantern. After some hesitation, he decided to apply to this\nman, not without having first glanced behind and in front of him, as\nthough he feared lest some one should hear the question which he was\nabout to put.\n\n\"Monsieur,\" said he, \"where is the court-house, if you please.\"\n\n\"You do not belong in town, sir?\" replied the bourgeois, who was an\noldish man; \"well, follow me. I happen to be going in the direction of\nthe court-house, that is to say, in the direction of the hotel of the\nprefecture; for the court-house is undergoing repairs just at this\nmoment, and the courts are holding their sittings provisionally in the\nprefecture.\"\n\n\"Is it there that the Assizes are held?\" he asked.\n\n\"Certainly, sir; you see, the prefecture of to-day was the bishop's\npalace before the Revolution. M. de Conzie, who was bishop in '82, built\na grand hall there. It is in this grand hall that the court is held.\"\n\nOn the way, the bourgeois said to him:--\n\n\"If Monsieur desires to witness a case, it is rather late. The sittings\ngenerally close at six o'clock.\"\n\nWhen they arrived on the grand square, however, the man pointed out to\nhim four long windows all lighted up, in the front of a vast and gloomy\nbuilding.\n\n\"Upon my word, sir, you are in luck; you have arrived in season. Do you\nsee those four windows? That is the Court of Assizes. There is light\nthere, so they are not through. The matter must have been greatly\nprotracted, and they are holding an evening session. Do you take an\ninterest in this affair? Is it a criminal case? Are you a witness?\"\n\nHe replied:--\n\n\"I have not come on any business; I only wish to speak to one of the\nlawyers.\"\n\n\"That is different,\" said the bourgeois. \"Stop, sir; here is the door\nwhere the sentry stands. You have only to ascend the grand staircase.\"\n\nHe conformed to the bourgeois's directions, and a few minutes later he\nwas in a hall containing many people, and where groups, intermingled\nwith lawyers in their gowns, were whispering together here and there.\n\nIt is always a heart-breaking thing to see these congregations of men\nrobed in black, murmuring together in low voices, on the threshold of\nthe halls of justice. It is rare that charity and pity are the outcome\nof these words. Condemnations pronounced in advance are more likely\nto be the result. All these groups seem to the passing and thoughtful\nobserver so many sombre hives where buzzing spirits construct in concert\nall sorts of dark edifices.\n\nThis spacious hall, illuminated by a single lamp, was the old hall of\nthe episcopal palace, and served as the large hall of the palace\nof justice. A double-leaved door, which was closed at that moment,\nseparated it from the large apartment where the court was sitting.\n\nThe obscurity was such that he did not fear to accost the first lawyer\nwhom he met.\n\n\"What stage have they reached, sir?\" he asked.\n\n\"It is finished,\" said the lawyer.\n\n\"Finished!\"\n\nThis word was repeated in such accents that the lawyer turned round.\n\n\"Excuse me sir; perhaps you are a relative?\"\n\n\"No; I know no one here. Has judgment been pronounced?\"\n\n\"Of course. Nothing else was possible.\"\n\n\"To penal servitude?\"\n\n\"For life.\"\n\nHe continued, in a voice so weak that it was barely audible:--\n\n\"Then his identity was established?\"\n\n\"What identity?\" replied the lawyer. \"There was no identity to be\nestablished. The matter was very simple. The woman had murdered her\nchild; the infanticide was proved; the jury threw out the question of\npremeditation, and she was condemned for life.\"\n\n\"So it was a woman?\" said he.\n\n\"Why, certainly. The Limosin woman. Of what are you speaking?\"\n\n\"Nothing. But since it is all over, how comes it that the hall is still\nlighted?\"\n\n\"For another case, which was begun about two hours ago.\"\n\n\"What other case?\"\n\n\"Oh! this one is a clear case also. It is about a sort of blackguard;\na man arrested for a second offence; a convict who has been guilty of\ntheft. I don't know his name exactly. There's a bandit's phiz for you!\nI'd send him to the galleys on the strength of his face alone.\"\n\n\"Is there any way of getting into the court-room, sir?\" said he.\n\n\"I really think that there is not. There is a great crowd. However,\nthe hearing has been suspended. Some people have gone out, and when the\nhearing is resumed, you might make an effort.\"\n\n\"Where is the entrance?\"\n\n\"Through yonder large door.\"\n\nThe lawyer left him. In the course of a few moments he had experienced,\nalmost simultaneously, almost intermingled with each other, all possible\nemotions. The words of this indifferent spectator had, in turn, pierced\nhis heart like needles of ice and like blades of fire. When he saw that\nnothing was settled, he breathed freely once more; but he could not have\ntold whether what he felt was pain or pleasure.\n\nHe drew near to many groups and listened to what they were saying. The\ndocket of the session was very heavy; the president had appointed\nfor the same day two short and simple cases. They had begun with the\ninfanticide, and now they had reached the convict, the old offender, the\n\"return horse.\" This man had stolen apples, but that did not appear to\nbe entirely proved; what had been proved was, that he had already been\nin the galleys at Toulon. It was that which lent a bad aspect to\nhis case. However, the man's examination and the depositions of the\nwitnesses had been completed, but the lawyer's plea, and the speech\nof the public prosecutor were still to come; it could not be\nfinished before midnight. The man would probably be condemned; the\nattorney-general was very clever, and never missed his culprits; he was\na brilliant fellow who wrote verses.\n\nAn usher stood at the door communicating with the hall of the Assizes.\nHe inquired of this usher:--\n\n\"Will the door be opened soon, sir?\"\n\n\"It will not be opened at all,\" replied the usher.\n\n\"What! It will not be opened when the hearing is resumed? Is not the\nhearing suspended?\"\n\n\"The hearing has just been begun again,\" replied the usher, \"but the\ndoor will not be opened again.\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"Because the hall is full.\"\n\n\"What! There is not room for one more?\"\n\n\"Not another one. The door is closed. No one can enter now.\"\n\nThe usher added after a pause: \"There are, to tell the truth, two\nor three extra places behind Monsieur le President, but Monsieur le\nPresident only admits public functionaries to them.\"\n\nSo saying, the usher turned his back.\n\nHe retired with bowed head, traversed the antechamber, and slowly\ndescended the stairs, as though hesitating at every step. It is probable\nthat he was holding counsel with himself. The violent conflict which had\nbeen going on within him since the preceding evening was not yet ended;\nand every moment he encountered some new phase of it. On reaching the\nlanding-place, he leaned his back against the balusters and folded his\narms. All at once he opened his coat, drew out his pocket-book, took\nfrom it a pencil, tore out a leaf, and upon that leaf he wrote rapidly,\nby the light of the street lantern, this line: M. Madeleine, Mayor of M.\nsur M.; then he ascended the stairs once more with great strides, made\nhis way through the crowd, walked straight up to the usher, handed him\nthe paper, and said in an authoritative manner:--\n\n\"Take this to Monsieur le President.\"\n\nThe usher took the paper, cast a glance upon it, and obeyed.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII--AN ENTRANCE BY FAVOR\n\n\nAlthough he did not suspect the fact, the mayor of M. sur M. enjoyed\na sort of celebrity. For the space of seven years his reputation for\nvirtue had filled the whole of Bas Boulonnais; it had eventually passed\nthe confines of a small district and had been spread abroad through\ntwo or three neighboring departments. Besides the service which he had\nrendered to the chief town by resuscitating the black jet industry,\nthere was not one out of the hundred and forty communes of the\narrondissement of M. sur M. which was not indebted to him for some\nbenefit. He had even at need contrived to aid and multiply the\nindustries of other arrondissements. It was thus that he had, when\noccasion offered, supported with his credit and his funds the linen\nfactory at Boulogne, the flax-spinning industry at Frevent, and the\nhydraulic manufacture of cloth at Boubers-sur-Canche. Everywhere the\nname of M. Madeleine was pronounced with veneration. Arras and Douai\nenvied the happy little town of M. sur M. its mayor.\n\nThe Councillor of the Royal Court of Douai, who was presiding over this\nsession of the Assizes at Arras, was acquainted, in common with the rest\nof the world, with this name which was so profoundly and universally\nhonored. When the usher, discreetly opening the door which connected\nthe council-chamber with the court-room, bent over the back of the\nPresident's arm-chair and handed him the paper on which was inscribed\nthe line which we have just perused, adding: \"The gentleman desires to\nbe present at the trial,\" the President, with a quick and deferential\nmovement, seized a pen and wrote a few words at the bottom of the paper\nand returned it to the usher, saying, \"Admit him.\"\n\nThe unhappy man whose history we are relating had remained near the door\nof the hall, in the same place and the same attitude in which the usher\nhad left him. In the midst of his revery he heard some one saying to\nhim, \"Will Monsieur do me the honor to follow me?\" It was the same usher\nwho had turned his back upon him but a moment previously, and who was\nnow bowing to the earth before him. At the same time, the usher handed\nhim the paper. He unfolded it, and as he chanced to be near the light,\nhe could read it.\n\n\"The President of the Court of Assizes presents his respects to M.\nMadeleine.\"\n\nHe crushed the paper in his hand as though those words contained for him\na strange and bitter aftertaste.\n\nHe followed the usher.\n\nA few minutes later he found himself alone in a sort of wainscoted\ncabinet of severe aspect, lighted by two wax candles, placed upon a\ntable with a green cloth. The last words of the usher who had just\nquitted him still rang in his ears: \"Monsieur, you are now in the\ncouncil-chamber; you have only to turn the copper handle of yonder door,\nand you will find yourself in the court-room, behind the President's\nchair.\" These words were mingled in his thoughts with a vague memory of\nnarrow corridors and dark staircases which he had recently traversed.\n\nThe usher had left him alone. The supreme moment had arrived. He sought\nto collect his faculties, but could not. It is chiefly at the moment\nwhen there is the greatest need for attaching them to the painful\nrealities of life, that the threads of thought snap within the brain. He\nwas in the very place where the judges deliberated and condemned. With\nstupid tranquillity he surveyed this peaceful and terrible apartment,\nwhere so many lives had been broken, which was soon to ring with his\nname, and which his fate was at that moment traversing. He stared at\nthe wall, then he looked at himself, wondering that it should be that\nchamber and that it should be he.\n\nHe had eaten nothing for four and twenty hours; he was worn out by the\njolts of the cart, but he was not conscious of it. It seemed to him that\nhe felt nothing.\n\nHe approached a black frame which was suspended on the wall, and which\ncontained, under glass, an ancient autograph letter of Jean Nicolas\nPache, mayor of Paris and minister, and dated, through an error, no\ndoubt, the 9th of June, of the year II., and in which Pache forwarded to\nthe commune the list of ministers and deputies held in arrest by them.\nAny spectator who had chanced to see him at that moment, and who had\nwatched him, would have imagined, doubtless, that this letter struck him\nas very curious, for he did not take his eyes from it, and he read it\ntwo or three times. He read it without paying any attention to it, and\nunconsciously. He was thinking of Fantine and Cosette.\n\nAs he dreamed, he turned round, and his eyes fell upon the brass knob\nof the door which separated him from the Court of Assizes. He had almost\nforgotten that door. His glance, calm at first, paused there, remained\nfixed on that brass handle, then grew terrified, and little by little\nbecame impregnated with fear. Beads of perspiration burst forth among\nhis hair and trickled down upon his temples.\n\nAt a certain moment he made that indescribable gesture of a sort of\nauthority mingled with rebellion, which is intended to convey, and which\ndoes so well convey, \"Pardieu! who compels me to this?\" Then he wheeled\nbriskly round, caught sight of the door through which he had entered in\nfront of him, went to it, opened it, and passed out. He was no longer\nin that chamber; he was outside in a corridor, a long, narrow corridor,\nbroken by steps and gratings, making all sorts of angles, lighted\nhere and there by lanterns similar to the night taper of invalids, the\ncorridor through which he had approached. He breathed, he listened; not\na sound in front, not a sound behind him, and he fled as though pursued.\n\nWhen he had turned many angles in this corridor, he still listened. The\nsame silence reigned, and there was the same darkness around him. He was\nout of breath; he staggered; he leaned against the wall. The stone was\ncold; the perspiration lay ice-cold on his brow; he straightened himself\nup with a shiver.\n\nThen, there alone in the darkness, trembling with cold and with\nsomething else, too, perchance, he meditated.\n\nHe had meditated all night long; he had meditated all the day: he heard\nwithin him but one voice, which said, \"Alas!\"\n\nA quarter of an hour passed thus. At length he bowed his head, sighed\nwith agony, dropped his arms, and retraced his steps. He walked slowly,\nand as though crushed. It seemed as though some one had overtaken him in\nhis flight and was leading him back.\n\nHe re-entered the council-chamber. The first thing he caught sight of\nwas the knob of the door. This knob, which was round and of polished\nbrass, shone like a terrible star for him. He gazed at it as a lamb\nmight gaze into the eye of a tiger.\n\nHe could not take his eyes from it. From time to time he advanced a step\nand approached the door.\n\nHad he listened, he would have heard the sound of the adjoining hall\nlike a sort of confused murmur; but he did not listen, and he did not\nhear.\n\nSuddenly, without himself knowing how it happened, he found himself near\nthe door; he grasped the knob convulsively; the door opened.\n\nHe was in the court-room.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX--A PLACE WHERE CONVICTIONS ARE IN PROCESS OF FORMATION\n\nHe advanced a pace, closed the door mechanically behind him, and\nremained standing, contemplating what he saw.\n\nIt was a vast and badly lighted apartment, now full of uproar, now full\nof silence, where all the apparatus of a criminal case, with its petty\nand mournful gravity in the midst of the throng, was in process of\ndevelopment.\n\nAt the one end of the hall, the one where he was, were judges, with\nabstracted air, in threadbare robes, who were gnawing their nails or\nclosing their eyelids; at the other end, a ragged crowd; lawyers in\nall sorts of attitudes; soldiers with hard but honest faces; ancient,\nspotted woodwork, a dirty ceiling, tables covered with serge that was\nyellow rather than green; doors blackened by handmarks; tap-room\nlamps which emitted more smoke than light, suspended from nails in\nthe wainscot; on the tables candles in brass candlesticks; darkness,\nugliness, sadness; and from all this there was disengaged an austere and\naugust impression, for one there felt that grand human thing which is\ncalled the law, and that grand divine thing which is called justice.\n\nNo one in all that throng paid any attention to him; all glances were\ndirected towards a single point, a wooden bench placed against a small\ndoor, in the stretch of wall on the President's left; on this bench,\nilluminated by several candles, sat a man between two gendarmes.\n\nThis man was the man.\n\nHe did not seek him; he saw him; his eyes went thither naturally, as\nthough they had known beforehand where that figure was.\n\nHe thought he was looking at himself, grown old; not absolutely the same\nin face, of course, but exactly similar in attitude and aspect, with his\nbristling hair, with that wild and uneasy eye, with that blouse, just as\nit was on the day when he entered D----, full of hatred, concealing\nhis soul in that hideous mass of frightful thoughts which he had spent\nnineteen years in collecting on the floor of the prison.\n\nHe said to himself with a shudder, \"Good God! shall I become like that\nagain?\"\n\nThis creature seemed to be at least sixty; there was something\nindescribably coarse, stupid, and frightened about him.\n\nAt the sound made by the opening door, people had drawn aside to make\nway for him; the President had turned his head, and, understanding that\nthe personage who had just entered was the mayor of M. sur M., he had\nbowed to him; the attorney-general, who had seen M. Madeleine at M.\nsur M., whither the duties of his office had called him more than once,\nrecognized him and saluted him also: he had hardly perceived it; he was\nthe victim of a sort of hallucination; he was watching.\n\nJudges, clerks, gendarmes, a throng of cruelly curious heads, all these\nhe had already beheld once, in days gone by, twenty-seven years before;\nhe had encountered those fatal things once more; there they were; they\nmoved; they existed; it was no longer an effort of his memory, a mirage\nof his thought; they were real gendarmes and real judges, a real\ncrowd, and real men of flesh and blood: it was all over; he beheld the\nmonstrous aspects of his past reappear and live once more around him,\nwith all that there is formidable in reality.\n\nAll this was yawning before him.\n\nHe was horrified by it; he shut his eyes, and exclaimed in the deepest\nrecesses of his soul, \"Never!\"\n\nAnd by a tragic play of destiny which made all his ideas tremble, and\nrendered him nearly mad, it was another self of his that was there! all\ncalled that man who was being tried Jean Valjean.\n\nUnder his very eyes, unheard-of vision, he had a sort of representation\nof the most horrible moment of his life, enacted by his spectre.\n\nEverything was there; the apparatus was the same, the hour of the night,\nthe faces of the judges, of soldiers, and of spectators; all were the\nsame, only above the President's head there hung a crucifix, something\nwhich the courts had lacked at the time of his condemnation: God had\nbeen absent when he had been judged.\n\nThere was a chair behind him; he dropped into it, terrified at the\nthought that he might be seen; when he was seated, he took advantage of\na pile of cardboard boxes, which stood on the judge's desk, to conceal\nhis face from the whole room; he could now see without being seen; he\nhad fully regained consciousness of the reality of things; gradually he\nrecovered; he attained that phase of composure where it is possible to\nlisten.\n\nM. Bamatabois was one of the jurors.\n\nHe looked for Javert, but did not see him; the seat of the witnesses was\nhidden from him by the clerk's table, and then, as we have just said,\nthe hall was sparely lighted.\n\nAt the moment of this entrance, the defendant's lawyer had just finished\nhis plea.\n\nThe attention of all was excited to the highest pitch; the affair had\nlasted for three hours: for three hours that crowd had been watching a\nstrange man, a miserable specimen of humanity, either profoundly stupid\nor profoundly subtle, gradually bending beneath the weight of a terrible\nlikeness. This man, as the reader already knows, was a vagabond who had\nbeen found in a field carrying a branch laden with ripe apples, broken\nin the orchard of a neighbor, called the Pierron orchard. Who was this\nman? an examination had been made; witnesses had been heard, and they\nwere unanimous; light had abounded throughout the entire debate; the\naccusation said: \"We have in our grasp not only a marauder, a stealer\nof fruit; we have here, in our hands, a bandit, an old offender who\nhas broken his ban, an ex-convict, a miscreant of the most dangerous\ndescription, a malefactor named Jean Valjean, whom justice has long been\nin search of, and who, eight years ago, on emerging from the galleys\nat Toulon, committed a highway robbery, accompanied by violence, on the\nperson of a child, a Savoyard named Little Gervais; a crime provided\nfor by article 383 of the Penal Code, the right to try him for which\nwe reserve hereafter, when his identity shall have been judicially\nestablished. He has just committed a fresh theft; it is a case of a\nsecond offence; condemn him for the fresh deed; later on he will be\njudged for the old crime.\" In the face of this accusation, in the face\nof the unanimity of the witnesses, the accused appeared to be astonished\nmore than anything else; he made signs and gestures which were meant to\nconvey No, or else he stared at the ceiling: he spoke with difficulty,\nreplied with embarrassment, but his whole person, from head to foot, was\na denial; he was an idiot in the presence of all these minds ranged in\norder of battle around him, and like a stranger in the midst of this\nsociety which was seizing fast upon him; nevertheless, it was a question\nof the most menacing future for him; the likeness increased every\nmoment, and the entire crowd surveyed, with more anxiety than he did\nhimself, that sentence freighted with calamity, which descended\never closer over his head; there was even a glimpse of a possibility\nafforded; besides the galleys, a possible death penalty, in case his\nidentity were established, and the affair of Little Gervais were to end\nthereafter in condemnation. Who was this man? what was the nature of his\napathy? was it imbecility or craft? Did he understand too well, or did\nhe not understand at all? these were questions which divided the crowd,\nand seemed to divide the jury; there was something both terrible and\npuzzling in this case: the drama was not only melancholy; it was also\nobscure.\n\nThe counsel for the defence had spoken tolerably well, in that\nprovincial tongue which has long constituted the eloquence of the bar,\nand which was formerly employed by all advocates, at Paris as well as at\nRomorantin or at Montbrison, and which to-day, having become classic, is\nno longer spoken except by the official orators of magistracy, to whom\nit is suited on account of its grave sonorousness and its majestic\nstride; a tongue in which a husband is called a consort, and a woman\na spouse; Paris, the centre of art and civilization; the king,\nthe monarch; Monseigneur the Bishop, a sainted pontiff; the\ndistrict-attorney, the eloquent interpreter of public prosecution; the\narguments, the accents which we have just listened to; the age of Louis\nXIV., the grand age; a theatre, the temple of Melpomene; the reigning\nfamily, the august blood of our kings; a concert, a musical solemnity;\nthe General Commandant of the province, the illustrious warrior, who,\netc.; the pupils in the seminary, these tender levities; errors imputed\nto newspapers, the imposture which distills its venom through the\ncolumns of those organs; etc. The lawyer had, accordingly, begun with an\nexplanation as to the theft of the apples,--an awkward matter couched\nin fine style; but Benigne Bossuet himself was obliged to allude to a\nchicken in the midst of a funeral oration, and he extricated himself\nfrom the situation in stately fashion. The lawyer established the fact\nthat the theft of the apples had not been circumstantially proved.\nHis client, whom he, in his character of counsel, persisted in calling\nChampmathieu, had not been seen scaling that wall nor breaking that\nbranch by any one. He had been taken with that branch (which the lawyer\npreferred to call a bough) in his possession; but he said that he had\nfound it broken off and lying on the ground, and had picked it up.\nWhere was there any proof to the contrary? No doubt that branch had been\nbroken off and concealed after the scaling of the wall, then thrown away\nby the alarmed marauder; there was no doubt that there had been a\nthief in the case. But what proof was there that that thief had been\nChampmathieu? One thing only. His character as an ex-convict. The\nlawyer did not deny that that character appeared to be, unhappily,\nwell attested; the accused had resided at Faverolles; the accused had\nexercised the calling of a tree-pruner there; the name of Champmathieu\nmight well have had its origin in Jean Mathieu; all that was true,--in\nshort, four witnesses recognize Champmathieu, positively and without\nhesitation, as that convict, Jean Valjean; to these signs, to this\ntestimony, the counsel could oppose nothing but the denial of his\nclient, the denial of an interested party; but supposing that he was\nthe convict Jean Valjean, did that prove that he was the thief of the\napples? that was a presumption at the most, not a proof. The prisoner,\nit was true, and his counsel, \"in good faith,\" was obliged to admit it,\nhad adopted \"a bad system of defence.\" He obstinately denied everything,\nthe theft and his character of convict. An admission upon this last\npoint would certainly have been better, and would have won for him the\nindulgence of his judges; the counsel had advised him to do this; but\nthe accused had obstinately refused, thinking, no doubt, that he would\nsave everything by admitting nothing. It was an error; but ought not the\npaucity of this intelligence to be taken into consideration? This man\nwas visibly stupid. Long-continued wretchedness in the galleys, long\nmisery outside the galleys, had brutalized him, etc. He defended himself\nbadly; was that a reason for condemning him? As for the affair with\nLittle Gervais, the counsel need not discuss it; it did not enter into\nthe case. The lawyer wound up by beseeching the jury and the court, if\nthe identity of Jean Valjean appeared to them to be evident, to apply\nto him the police penalties which are provided for a criminal who has\nbroken his ban, and not the frightful chastisement which descends upon\nthe convict guilty of a second offence.\n\nThe district-attorney answered the counsel for the defence. He was\nviolent and florid, as district-attorneys usually are.\n\nHe congratulated the counsel for the defence on his \"loyalty,\" and\nskilfully took advantage of this loyalty. He reached the accused through\nall the concessions made by his lawyer. The advocate had seemed to admit\nthat the prisoner was Jean Valjean. He took note of this. So this man\nwas Jean Valjean. This point had been conceded to the accusation and\ncould no longer be disputed. Here, by means of a clever\nautonomasia which went back to the sources and causes of crime, the\ndistrict-attorney thundered against the immorality of the romantic\nschool, then dawning under the name of the Satanic school, which\nhad been bestowed upon it by the critics of the Quotidienne and the\nOriflamme; he attributed, not without some probability, to the influence\nof this perverse literature the crime of Champmathieu, or rather,\nto speak more correctly, of Jean Valjean. Having exhausted these\nconsiderations, he passed on to Jean Valjean himself. Who was this Jean\nValjean? Description of Jean Valjean: a monster spewed forth, etc.\nThe model for this sort of description is contained in the tale of\nTheramene, which is not useful to tragedy, but which every day renders\ngreat services to judicial eloquence. The audience and the jury\n\"shuddered.\" The description finished, the district-attorney resumed\nwith an oratorical turn calculated to raise the enthusiasm of the\njournal of the prefecture to the highest pitch on the following day: And\nit is such a man, etc., etc., etc., vagabond, beggar, without means of\nexistence, etc., etc., inured by his past life to culpable deeds, and\nbut little reformed by his sojourn in the galleys, as was proved by the\ncrime committed against Little Gervais, etc., etc.; it is such a man,\ncaught upon the highway in the very act of theft, a few paces from a\nwall that had been scaled, still holding in his hand the object\nstolen, who denies the crime, the theft, the climbing the wall; denies\neverything; denies even his own identity! In addition to a hundred\nother proofs, to which we will not recur, four witnesses recognize\nhim--Javert, the upright inspector of police; Javert, and three of\nhis former companions in infamy, the convicts Brevet, Chenildieu, and\nCochepaille. What does he offer in opposition to this overwhelming\nunanimity? His denial. What obduracy! You will do justice, gentlemen\nof the jury, etc., etc. While the district-attorney was speaking, the\naccused listened to him open-mouthed, with a sort of amazement in which\nsome admiration was assuredly blended. He was evidently surprised that\na man could talk like that. From time to time, at those \"energetic\"\nmoments of the prosecutor's speech, when eloquence which cannot contain\nitself overflows in a flood of withering epithets and envelops the\naccused like a storm, he moved his head slowly from right to left and\nfrom left to right in the sort of mute and melancholy protest with which\nhe had contented himself since the beginning of the argument. Two or\nthree times the spectators who were nearest to him heard him say in\na low voice, \"That is what comes of not having asked M. Baloup.\" The\ndistrict-attorney directed the attention of the jury to this stupid\nattitude, evidently deliberate, which denoted not imbecility, but craft,\nskill, a habit of deceiving justice, and which set forth in all its\nnakedness the \"profound perversity\" of this man. He ended by making\nhis reserves on the affair of Little Gervais and demanding a severe\nsentence.\n\nAt that time, as the reader will remember, it was penal servitude for\nlife.\n\nThe counsel for the defence rose, began by complimenting Monsieur\nl'Avocat-General on his \"admirable speech,\" then replied as best he\ncould; but he weakened; the ground was evidently slipping away from\nunder his feet.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X--THE SYSTEM OF DENIALS\n\nThe moment for closing the debate had arrived. The President had the\naccused stand up, and addressed to him the customary question, \"Have you\nanything to add to your defence?\"\n\nThe man did not appear to understand, as he stood there, twisting in his\nhands a terrible cap which he had.\n\nThe President repeated the question.\n\nThis time the man heard it. He seemed to understand. He made a motion\nlike a man who is just waking up, cast his eyes about him, stared at\nthe audience, the gendarmes, his counsel, the jury, the court, laid\nhis monstrous fist on the rim of woodwork in front of his bench,\ntook another look, and all at once, fixing his glance upon the\ndistrict-attorney, he began to speak. It was like an eruption.\nIt seemed, from the manner in which the words escaped from his\nmouth,--incoherent, impetuous, pell-mell, tumbling over each other,--as\nthough they were all pressing forward to issue forth at once. He said:--\n\n\"This is what I have to say. That I have been a wheelwright in Paris,\nand that it was with Monsieur Baloup. It is a hard trade. In the\nwheelwright's trade one works always in the open air, in courtyards,\nunder sheds when the masters are good, never in closed workshops,\nbecause space is required, you see. In winter one gets so cold that one\nbeats one's arms together to warm one's self; but the masters don't like\nit; they say it wastes time. Handling iron when there is ice between\nthe paving-stones is hard work. That wears a man out quickly. One is old\nwhile he is still quite young in that trade. At forty a man is done for.\nI was fifty-three. I was in a bad state. And then, workmen are so mean!\nWhen a man is no longer young, they call him nothing but an old bird,\nold beast! I was not earning more than thirty sous a day. They paid me\nas little as possible. The masters took advantage of my age--and then I\nhad my daughter, who was a laundress at the river. She earned a little\nalso. It sufficed for us two. She had trouble, also; all day long up to\nher waist in a tub, in rain, in snow. When the wind cuts your face, when\nit freezes, it is all the same; you must still wash. There are people\nwho have not much linen, and wait until late; if you do not wash, you\nlose your custom. The planks are badly joined, and water drops on you\nfrom everywhere; you have your petticoats all damp above and below. That\npenetrates. She has also worked at the laundry of the Enfants-Rouges,\nwhere the water comes through faucets. You are not in the tub there; you\nwash at the faucet in front of you, and rinse in a basin behind you. As\nit is enclosed, you are not so cold; but there is that hot steam, which\nis terrible, and which ruins your eyes. She came home at seven o'clock\nin the evening, and went to bed at once, she was so tired. Her husband\nbeat her. She is dead. We have not been very happy. She was a good girl,\nwho did not go to the ball, and who was very peaceable. I remember\none Shrove-Tuesday when she went to bed at eight o'clock. There, I am\ntelling the truth; you have only to ask. Ah, yes! how stupid I am! Paris\nis a gulf. Who knows Father Champmathieu there? But M. Baloup does, I\ntell you. Go see at M. Baloup's; and after all, I don't know what is\nwanted of me.\"\n\nThe man ceased speaking, and remained standing. He had said these things\nin a loud, rapid, hoarse voice, with a sort of irritated and savage\ningenuousness. Once he paused to salute some one in the crowd. The sort\nof affirmations which he seemed to fling out before him at random came\nlike hiccoughs, and to each he added the gesture of a wood-cutter who is\nsplitting wood. When he had finished, the audience burst into a laugh.\nHe stared at the public, and, perceiving that they were laughing, and\nnot understanding why, he began to laugh himself.\n\nIt was inauspicious.\n\nThe President, an attentive and benevolent man, raised his voice.\n\nHe reminded \"the gentlemen of the jury\" that \"the sieur Baloup, formerly\na master-wheelwright, with whom the accused stated that he had served,\nhad been summoned in vain. He had become bankrupt, and was not to be\nfound.\" Then turning to the accused, he enjoined him to listen to what\nhe was about to say, and added: \"You are in a position where reflection\nis necessary. The gravest presumptions rest upon you, and may induce\nvital results. Prisoner, in your own interests, I summon you for the\nlast time to explain yourself clearly on two points. In the first place,\ndid you or did you not climb the wall of the Pierron orchard, break\nthe branch, and steal the apples; that is to say, commit the crime\nof breaking in and theft? In the second place, are you the discharged\nconvict, Jean Valjean--yes or no?\"\n\nThe prisoner shook his head with a capable air, like a man who has\nthoroughly understood, and who knows what answer he is going to make. He\nopened his mouth, turned towards the President, and said:--\n\n\"In the first place--\"\n\nThen he stared at his cap, stared at the ceiling, and held his peace.\n\n\"Prisoner,\" said the district-attorney, in a severe voice; \"pay\nattention. You are not answering anything that has been asked of you.\nYour embarrassment condemns you. It is evident that your name is not\nChampmathieu; that you are the convict, Jean Valjean, concealed first\nunder the name of Jean Mathieu, which was the name of his mother; that\nyou went to Auvergne; that you were born at Faverolles, where you were\na pruner of trees. It is evident that you have been guilty of entering,\nand of the theft of ripe apples from the Pierron orchard. The gentlemen\nof the jury will form their own opinion.\"\n\n[Illustration: Father Champmathieu on Trial]\n\nThe prisoner had finally resumed his seat; he arose abruptly when the\ndistrict-attorney had finished, and exclaimed:--\n\n\"You are very wicked; that you are! This what I wanted to say; I could\nnot find words for it at first. I have stolen nothing. I am a man who\ndoes not have something to eat every day. I was coming from Ailly; I\nwas walking through the country after a shower, which had made the whole\ncountry yellow: even the ponds were overflowed, and nothing sprang from\nthe sand any more but the little blades of grass at the wayside. I\nfound a broken branch with apples on the ground; I picked up the branch\nwithout knowing that it would get me into trouble. I have been in\nprison, and they have been dragging me about for the last three months;\nmore than that I cannot say; people talk against me, they tell me,\n'Answer!' The gendarme, who is a good fellow, nudges my elbow, and says\nto me in a low voice, 'Come, answer!' I don't know how to explain; I\nhave no education; I am a poor man; that is where they wrong me, because\nthey do not see this. I have not stolen; I picked up from the ground\nthings that were lying there. You say, Jean Valjean, Jean Mathieu! I\ndon't know those persons; they are villagers. I worked for M. Baloup,\nBoulevard de l'Hopital; my name is Champmathieu. You are very clever to\ntell me where I was born; I don't know myself: it's not everybody\nwho has a house in which to come into the world; that would be too\nconvenient. I think that my father and mother were people who strolled\nalong the highways; I know nothing different. When I was a child,\nthey called me young fellow; now they call me old fellow; those are my\nbaptismal names; take that as you like. I have been in Auvergne; I have\nbeen at Faverolles. Pardi. Well! can't a man have been in Auvergne, or\nat Faverolles, without having been in the galleys? I tell you that I\nhave not stolen, and that I am Father Champmathieu; I have been with M.\nBaloup; I have had a settled residence. You worry me with your nonsense,\nthere! Why is everybody pursuing me so furiously?\"\n\nThe district-attorney had remained standing; he addressed the\nPresident:--\n\n\"Monsieur le President, in view of the confused but exceedingly clever\ndenials of the prisoner, who would like to pass himself off as an idiot,\nbut who will not succeed in so doing,--we shall attend to that,--we\ndemand that it shall please you and that it shall please the court to\nsummon once more into this place the convicts Brevet, Cochepaille, and\nChenildieu, and Police-Inspector Javert, and question them for the last\ntime as to the identity of the prisoner with the convict Jean Valjean.\"\n\n\"I would remind the district-attorney,\" said the President, \"that\nPolice-Inspector Javert, recalled by his duties to the capital of a\nneighboring arrondissement, left the court-room and the town as soon as\nhe had made his deposition; we have accorded him permission, with the\nconsent of the district-attorney and of the counsel for the prisoner.\"\n\n\"That is true, Mr. President,\" responded the district-attorney. \"In the\nabsence of sieur Javert, I think it my duty to remind the gentlemen of\nthe jury of what he said here a few hours ago. Javert is an estimable\nman, who does honor by his rigorous and strict probity to inferior but\nimportant functions. These are the terms of his deposition: 'I do not\neven stand in need of circumstantial proofs and moral presumptions to\ngive the lie to the prisoner's denial. I recognize him perfectly. The\nname of this man is not Champmathieu; he is an ex-convict named Jean\nValjean, and is very vicious and much to be feared. It is only with\nextreme regret that he was released at the expiration of his term. He\nunderwent nineteen years of penal servitude for theft. He made five or\nsix attempts to escape. Besides the theft from Little Gervais, and from\nthe Pierron orchard, I suspect him of a theft committed in the house of\nHis Grace the late Bishop of D---- I often saw him at the time when I\nwas adjutant of the galley-guard at the prison in Toulon. I repeat that\nI recognize him perfectly.'\"\n\nThis extremely precise statement appeared to produce a vivid impression\non the public and on the jury. The district-attorney concluded by\ninsisting, that in default of Javert, the three witnesses Brevet,\nChenildieu, and Cochepaille should be heard once more and solemnly\ninterrogated.\n\nThe President transmitted the order to an usher, and, a moment later,\nthe door of the witnesses' room opened. The usher, accompanied by a\ngendarme ready to lend him armed assistance, introduced the convict\nBrevet. The audience was in suspense; and all breasts heaved as though\nthey had contained but one soul.\n\nThe ex-convict Brevet wore the black and gray waistcoat of the central\nprisons. Brevet was a person sixty years of age, who had a sort of\nbusiness man's face, and the air of a rascal. The two sometimes go\ntogether. In prison, whither fresh misdeeds had led him, he had become\nsomething in the nature of a turnkey. He was a man of whom his superiors\nsaid, \"He tries to make himself of use.\" The chaplains bore good\ntestimony as to his religious habits. It must not be forgotten that this\npassed under the Restoration.\n\n\"Brevet,\" said the President, \"you have undergone an ignominious\nsentence, and you cannot take an oath.\"\n\nBrevet dropped his eyes.\n\n\"Nevertheless,\" continued the President, \"even in the man whom the law\nhas degraded, there may remain, when the divine mercy permits it, a\nsentiment of honor and of equity. It is to this sentiment that I\nappeal at this decisive hour. If it still exists in you,--and I hope\nit does,--reflect before replying to me: consider on the one hand, this\nman, whom a word from you may ruin; on the other hand, justice, which a\nword from you may enlighten. The instant is solemn; there is still time\nto retract if you think you have been mistaken. Rise, prisoner. Brevet,\ntake a good look at the accused, recall your souvenirs, and tell us on\nyour soul and conscience, if you persist in recognizing this man as your\nformer companion in the galleys, Jean Valjean?\"\n\nBrevet looked at the prisoner, then turned towards the court.\n\n\"Yes, Mr. President, I was the first to recognize him, and I stick to\nit; that man is Jean Valjean, who entered at Toulon in 1796, and left in\n1815. I left a year later. He has the air of a brute now; but it must be\nbecause age has brutalized him; he was sly at the galleys: I recognize\nhim positively.\"\n\n\"Take your seat,\" said the President. \"Prisoner, remain standing.\"\n\nChenildieu was brought in, a prisoner for life, as was indicated by his\nred cassock and his green cap. He was serving out his sentence at the\ngalleys of Toulon, whence he had been brought for this case. He was a\nsmall man of about fifty, brisk, wrinkled, frail, yellow, brazen-faced,\nfeverish, who had a sort of sickly feebleness about all his limbs and\nhis whole person, and an immense force in his glance. His companions in\nthe galleys had nicknamed him I-deny-God (Je-nie Dieu, Chenildieu).\n\nThe President addressed him in nearly the same words which he had\nused to Brevet. At the moment when he reminded him of his infamy which\ndeprived him of the right to take an oath, Chenildieu raised his\nhead and looked the crowd in the face. The President invited him to\nreflection, and asked him as he had asked Brevet, if he persisted in\nrecognition of the prisoner.\n\nChenildieu burst out laughing.\n\n\"Pardieu, as if I didn't recognize him! We were attached to the same\nchain for five years. So you are sulking, old fellow?\"\n\n\"Go take your seat,\" said the President.\n\nThe usher brought in Cochepaille. He was another convict for life, who\nhad come from the galleys, and was dressed in red, like Chenildieu, was\na peasant from Lourdes, and a half-bear of the Pyrenees. He had guarded\nthe flocks among the mountains, and from a shepherd he had slipped into\na brigand. Cochepaille was no less savage and seemed even more stupid\nthan the prisoner. He was one of those wretched men whom nature has\nsketched out for wild beasts, and on whom society puts the finishing\ntouches as convicts in the galleys.\n\nThe President tried to touch him with some grave and pathetic words,\nand asked him, as he had asked the other two, if he persisted, without\nhesitation or trouble, in recognizing the man who was standing before\nhim.\n\n\"He is Jean Valjean,\" said Cochepaille. \"He was even called\nJean-the-Screw, because he was so strong.\"\n\nEach of these affirmations from these three men, evidently sincere and\nin good faith, had raised in the audience a murmur of bad augury for the\nprisoner,--a murmur which increased and lasted longer each time that a\nfresh declaration was added to the proceeding.\n\nThe prisoner had listened to them, with that astounded face which was,\naccording to the accusation, his principal means of defence; at the\nfirst, the gendarmes, his neighbors, had heard him mutter between his\nteeth: \"Ah, well, he's a nice one!\" after the second, he said, a little\nlouder, with an air that was almost that of satisfaction, \"Good!\" at the\nthird, he cried, \"Famous!\"\n\nThe President addressed him:--\n\n\"Have you heard, prisoner? What have you to say?\"\n\nHe replied:--\n\n\"I say, 'Famous!'\"\n\nAn uproar broke out among the audience, and was communicated to the\njury; it was evident that the man was lost.\n\n\"Ushers,\" said the President, \"enforce silence! I am going to sum up the\narguments.\"\n\nAt that moment there was a movement just beside the President; a voice\nwas heard crying:--\n\n\"Brevet! Chenildieu! Cochepaille! look here!\"\n\nAll who heard that voice were chilled, so lamentable and terrible was\nit; all eyes were turned to the point whence it had proceeded. A man,\nplaced among the privileged spectators who were seated behind the\ncourt, had just risen, had pushed open the half-door which separated the\ntribunal from the audience, and was standing in the middle of the hall;\nthe President, the district-attorney, M. Bamatabois, twenty persons,\nrecognized him, and exclaimed in concert:--\n\n\"M. Madeleine!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI--CHAMPMATHIEU MORE AND MORE ASTONISHED\n\nIt was he, in fact. The clerk's lamp illumined his countenance. He held\nhis hat in his hand; there was no disorder in his clothing; his coat\nwas carefully buttoned; he was very pale, and he trembled slightly;\nhis hair, which had still been gray on his arrival in Arras, was now\nentirely white: it had turned white during the hour he had sat there.\n\nAll heads were raised: the sensation was indescribable; there was\na momentary hesitation in the audience, the voice had been so\nheart-rending; the man who stood there appeared so calm that they did\nnot understand at first. They asked themselves whether he had indeed\nuttered that cry; they could not believe that that tranquil man had been\nthe one to give that terrible outcry.\n\nThis indecision only lasted a few seconds. Even before the President\nand the district-attorney could utter a word, before the ushers and the\ngendarmes could make a gesture, the man whom all still called, at that\nmoment, M. Madeleine, had advanced towards the witnesses Cochepaille,\nBrevet, and Chenildieu.\n\n\"Do you not recognize me?\" said he.\n\nAll three remained speechless, and indicated by a sign of the head that\nthey did not know him. Cochepaille, who was intimidated, made a military\nsalute. M. Madeleine turned towards the jury and the court, and said in\na gentle voice:--\n\n\"Gentlemen of the jury, order the prisoner to be released! Mr.\nPresident, have me arrested. He is not the man whom you are in search\nof; it is I: I am Jean Valjean.\"\n\nNot a mouth breathed; the first commotion of astonishment had been\nfollowed by a silence like that of the grave; those within the hall\nexperienced that sort of religious terror which seizes the masses when\nsomething grand has been done.\n\nIn the meantime, the face of the President was stamped with sympathy and\nsadness; he had exchanged a rapid sign with the district-attorney and a\nfew low-toned words with the assistant judges; he addressed the public,\nand asked in accents which all understood:--\n\n\"Is there a physician present?\"\n\nThe district-attorney took the word:--\n\n\"Gentlemen of the jury, the very strange and unexpected incident\nwhich disturbs the audience inspires us, like yourselves, only with a\nsentiment which it is unnecessary for us to express. You all know, by\nreputation at least, the honorable M. Madeleine, mayor of M. sur M.;\nif there is a physician in the audience, we join the President in\nrequesting him to attend to M. Madeleine, and to conduct him to his\nhome.\"\n\nM. Madeleine did not allow the district-attorney to finish; he\ninterrupted him in accents full of suavity and authority. These are the\nwords which he uttered; here they are literally, as they were written\ndown, immediately after the trial by one of the witnesses to this scene,\nand as they now ring in the ears of those who heard them nearly forty\nyears ago:--\n\n\"I thank you, Mr. District-Attorney, but I am not mad; you shall see;\nyou were on the point of committing a great error; release this man! I\nam fulfilling a duty; I am that miserable criminal. I am the only one\nhere who sees the matter clearly, and I am telling you the truth. God,\nwho is on high, looks down on what I am doing at this moment, and that\nsuffices. You can take me, for here I am: but I have done my best; I\nconcealed myself under another name; I have become rich; I have become\na mayor; I have tried to re-enter the ranks of the honest. It seems that\nthat is not to be done. In short, there are many things which I cannot\ntell. I will not narrate the story of my life to you; you will hear it\none of these days. I robbed Monseigneur the Bishop, it is true; it is\ntrue that I robbed Little Gervais; they were right in telling you that\nJean Valjean was a very vicious wretch. Perhaps it was not altogether\nhis fault. Listen, honorable judges! a man who has been so greatly\nhumbled as I have has neither any remonstrances to make to Providence,\nnor any advice to give to society; but, you see, the infamy from which I\nhave tried to escape is an injurious thing; the galleys make the convict\nwhat he is; reflect upon that, if you please. Before going to the\ngalleys, I was a poor peasant, with very little intelligence, a sort\nof idiot; the galleys wrought a change in me. I was stupid; I became\nvicious: I was a block of wood; I became a firebrand. Later on,\nindulgence and kindness saved me, as severity had ruined me. But, pardon\nme, you cannot understand what I am saying. You will find at my house,\namong the ashes in the fireplace, the forty-sou piece which I stole,\nseven years ago, from little Gervais. I have nothing farther to add;\ntake me. Good God! the district-attorney shakes his head; you say, 'M.\nMadeleine has gone mad!' you do not believe me! that is distressing. Do\nnot, at least, condemn this man! What! these men do not recognize me! I\nwish Javert were here; he would recognize me.\"\n\nNothing can reproduce the sombre and kindly melancholy of tone which\naccompanied these words.\n\nHe turned to the three convicts, and said:--\n\n\"Well, I recognize you; do you remember, Brevet?\"\n\nHe paused, hesitated for an instant, and said:--\n\n\"Do you remember the knitted suspenders with a checked pattern which you\nwore in the galleys?\"\n\nBrevet gave a start of surprise, and surveyed him from head to foot with\na frightened air. He continued:--\n\n\"Chenildieu, you who conferred on yourself the name of 'Jenie-Dieu,'\nyour whole right shoulder bears a deep burn, because you one day laid\nyour shoulder against the chafing-dish full of coals, in order to efface\nthe three letters T. F. P., which are still visible, nevertheless;\nanswer, is this true?\"\n\n\"It is true,\" said Chenildieu.\n\nHe addressed himself to Cochepaille:--\n\n\"Cochepaille, you have, near the bend in your left arm, a date stamped\nin blue letters with burnt powder; the date is that of the landing of\nthe Emperor at Cannes, March 1, 1815; pull up your sleeve!\"\n\nCochepaille pushed up his sleeve; all eyes were focused on him and on\nhis bare arm.\n\nA gendarme held a light close to it; there was the date.\n\nThe unhappy man turned to the spectators and the judges with a smile\nwhich still rends the hearts of all who saw it whenever they think of\nit. It was a smile of triumph; it was also a smile of despair.\n\n\"You see plainly,\" he said, \"that I am Jean Valjean.\"\n\nIn that chamber there were no longer either judges, accusers, nor\ngendarmes; there was nothing but staring eyes and sympathizing hearts.\nNo one recalled any longer the part that each might be called upon\nto play; the district-attorney forgot he was there for the purpose of\nprosecuting, the President that he was there to preside, the counsel for\nthe defence that he was there to defend. It was a striking circumstance\nthat no question was put, that no authority intervened. The peculiarity\nof sublime spectacles is, that they capture all souls and turn witnesses\ninto spectators. No one, probably, could have explained what he felt;\nno one, probably, said to himself that he was witnessing the splendid\noutburst of a grand light: all felt themselves inwardly dazzled.\n\nIt was evident that they had Jean Valjean before their eyes. That was\nclear. The appearance of this man had sufficed to suffuse with light\nthat matter which had been so obscure but a moment previously, without\nany further explanation: the whole crowd, as by a sort of electric\nrevelation, understood instantly and at a single glance the simple\nand magnificent history of a man who was delivering himself up so\nthat another man might not be condemned in his stead. The details, the\nhesitations, little possible oppositions, were swallowed up in that vast\nand luminous fact.\n\nIt was an impression which vanished speedily, but which was irresistible\nat the moment.\n\n\"I do not wish to disturb the court further,\" resumed Jean Valjean. \"I\nshall withdraw, since you do not arrest me. I have many things to do.\nThe district-attorney knows who I am; he knows whither I am going; he\ncan have me arrested when he likes.\"\n\nHe directed his steps towards the door. Not a voice was raised, not an\narm extended to hinder him. All stood aside. At that moment there was\nabout him that divine something which causes multitudes to stand aside\nand make way for a man. He traversed the crowd slowly. It was never\nknown who opened the door, but it is certain that he found the door open\nwhen he reached it. On arriving there he turned round and said:--\n\n\"I am at your command, Mr. District-Attorney.\"\n\nThen he addressed the audience:--\n\n\"All of you, all who are present--consider me worthy of pity, do you\nnot? Good God! When I think of what I was on the point of doing, I\nconsider that I am to be envied. Nevertheless, I should have preferred\nnot to have had this occur.\"\n\nHe withdrew, and the door closed behind him as it had opened, for those\nwho do certain sovereign things are always sure of being served by some\none in the crowd.\n\nLess than an hour after this, the verdict of the jury freed the said\nChampmathieu from all accusations; and Champmathieu, being at once\nreleased, went off in a state of stupefaction, thinking that all men\nwere fools, and comprehending nothing of this vision.\n\n\n\n\nBOOK EIGHTH.--A COUNTER-BLOW\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I--IN WHAT MIRROR M. MADELEINE CONTEMPLATES HIS HAIR\n\nThe day had begun to dawn. Fantine had passed a sleepless and feverish\nnight, filled with happy visions; at daybreak she fell asleep. Sister\nSimplice, who had been watching with her, availed herself of this\nslumber to go and prepare a new potion of chinchona. The worthy sister\nhad been in the laboratory of the infirmary but a few moments, bending\nover her drugs and phials, and scrutinizing things very closely, on\naccount of the dimness which the half-light of dawn spreads over all\nobjects. Suddenly she raised her head and uttered a faint shriek. M.\nMadeleine stood before her; he had just entered silently.\n\n\"Is it you, Mr. Mayor?\" she exclaimed.\n\nHe replied in a low voice:--\n\n\"How is that poor woman?\"\n\n\"Not so bad just now; but we have been very uneasy.\"\n\nShe explained to him what had passed: that Fantine had been very ill the\nday before, and that she was better now, because she thought that the\nmayor had gone to Montfermeil to get her child. The sister dared not\nquestion the mayor; but she perceived plainly from his air that he had\nnot come from there.\n\n\"All that is good,\" said he; \"you were right not to undeceive her.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" responded the sister; \"but now, Mr. Mayor, she will see you and\nwill not see her child. What shall we say to her?\"\n\nHe reflected for a moment.\n\n\"God will inspire us,\" said he.\n\n\"But we cannot tell a lie,\" murmured the sister, half aloud.\n\nIt was broad daylight in the room. The light fell full on M. Madeleine's\nface. The sister chanced to raise her eyes to it.\n\n\"Good God, sir!\" she exclaimed; \"what has happened to you? Your hair is\nperfectly white!\"\n\n\"White!\" said he.\n\nSister Simplice had no mirror. She rummaged in a drawer, and pulled out\nthe little glass which the doctor of the infirmary used to see whether\na patient was dead and whether he no longer breathed. M. Madeleine took\nthe mirror, looked at his hair, and said:--\n\n\"Well!\"\n\nHe uttered the word indifferently, and as though his mind were on\nsomething else.\n\nThe sister felt chilled by something strange of which she caught a\nglimpse in all this.\n\nHe inquired:--\n\n\"Can I see her?\"\n\n\"Is not Monsieur le Maire going to have her child brought back to her?\"\nsaid the sister, hardly venturing to put the question.\n\n\"Of course; but it will take two or three days at least.\"\n\n\"If she were not to see Monsieur le Maire until that time,\" went on\nthe sister, timidly, \"she would not know that Monsieur le Maire had\nreturned, and it would be easy to inspire her with patience; and when\nthe child arrived, she would naturally think Monsieur le Maire had just\ncome with the child. We should not have to enact a lie.\"\n\nM. Madeleine seemed to reflect for a few moments; then he said with his\ncalm gravity:--\n\n\"No, sister, I must see her. I may, perhaps, be in haste.\"\n\nThe nun did not appear to notice this word \"perhaps,\" which communicated\nan obscure and singular sense to the words of the mayor's speech. She\nreplied, lowering her eyes and her voice respectfully:--\n\n\"In that case, she is asleep; but Monsieur le Maire may enter.\"\n\nHe made some remarks about a door which shut badly, and the noise of\nwhich might awaken the sick woman; then he entered Fantine's chamber,\napproached the bed and drew aside the curtains. She was asleep. Her\nbreath issued from her breast with that tragic sound which is peculiar\nto those maladies, and which breaks the hearts of mothers when they are\nwatching through the night beside their sleeping child who is condemned\nto death. But this painful respiration hardly troubled a sort of\nineffable serenity which overspread her countenance, and which\ntransfigured her in her sleep. Her pallor had become whiteness; her\ncheeks were crimson; her long golden lashes, the only beauty of her\nyouth and her virginity which remained to her, palpitated, though they\nremained closed and drooping. Her whole person was trembling with an\nindescribable unfolding of wings, all ready to open wide and bear her\naway, which could be felt as they rustled, though they could not be\nseen. To see her thus, one would never have dreamed that she was\nan invalid whose life was almost despaired of. She resembled rather\nsomething on the point of soaring away than something on the point of\ndying.\n\nThe branch trembles when a hand approaches it to pluck a flower, and\nseems to both withdraw and to offer itself at one and the same time.\nThe human body has something of this tremor when the instant arrives in\nwhich the mysterious fingers of Death are about to pluck the soul.\n\nM. Madeleine remained for some time motionless beside that bed, gazing\nin turn upon the sick woman and the crucifix, as he had done two months\nbefore, on the day when he had come for the first time to see her\nin that asylum. They were both still there in the same attitude--she\nsleeping, he praying; only now, after the lapse of two months, her hair\nwas gray and his was white.\n\nThe sister had not entered with him. He stood beside the bed, with his\nfinger on his lips, as though there were some one in the chamber whom he\nmust enjoin to silence.\n\nShe opened her eyes, saw him, and said quietly, with a smile:--\n\n\"And Cosette?\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II--FANTINE HAPPY\n\nShe made no movement of either surprise or of joy; she was joy itself.\nThat simple question, \"And Cosette?\" was put with so profound a faith,\nwith so much certainty, with such a complete absence of disquiet and of\ndoubt, that he found not a word of reply. She continued:--\n\n\"I knew that you were there. I was asleep, but I saw you. I have seen\nyou for a long, long time. I have been following you with my eyes all\nnight long. You were in a glory, and you had around you all sorts of\ncelestial forms.\"\n\nHe raised his glance to the crucifix.\n\n\"But,\" she resumed, \"tell me where Cosette is. Why did not you place her\non my bed against the moment of my waking?\"\n\nHe made some mechanical reply which he was never afterwards able to\nrecall.\n\nFortunately, the doctor had been warned, and he now made his appearance.\nHe came to the aid of M. Madeleine.\n\n\"Calm yourself, my child,\" said the doctor; \"your child is here.\"\n\nFantine's eyes beamed and filled her whole face with light. She clasped\nher hands with an expression which contained all that is possible to\nprayer in the way of violence and tenderness.\n\n\"Oh!\" she exclaimed, \"bring her to me!\"\n\nTouching illusion of a mother! Cosette was, for her, still the little\nchild who is carried.\n\n\"Not yet,\" said the doctor, \"not just now. You still have some fever.\nThe sight of your child would agitate you and do you harm. You must be\ncured first.\"\n\nShe interrupted him impetuously:--\n\n\"But I am cured! Oh, I tell you that I am cured! What an ass that doctor\nis! The idea! I want to see my child!\"\n\n\"You see,\" said the doctor, \"how excited you become. So long as you are\nin this state I shall oppose your having your child. It is not enough\nto see her; it is necessary that you should live for her. When you are\nreasonable, I will bring her to you myself.\"\n\nThe poor mother bowed her head.\n\n\"I beg your pardon, doctor, I really beg your pardon. Formerly I should\nnever have spoken as I have just done; so many misfortunes have happened\nto me, that I sometimes do not know what I am saying. I understand you;\nyou fear the emotion. I will wait as long as you like, but I swear to\nyou that it would not have harmed me to see my daughter. I have been\nseeing her; I have not taken my eyes from her since yesterday evening.\nDo you know? If she were brought to me now, I should talk to her very\ngently. That is all. Is it not quite natural that I should desire to see\nmy daughter, who has been brought to me expressly from Montfermeil? I\nam not angry. I know well that I am about to be happy. All night long I\nhave seen white things, and persons who smiled at me. When Monsieur le\nDocteur pleases, he shall bring me Cosette. I have no longer any fever;\nI am well. I am perfectly conscious that there is nothing the matter\nwith me any more; but I am going to behave as though I were ill, and not\nstir, to please these ladies here. When it is seen that I am very calm,\nthey will say, 'She must have her child.'\"\n\nM. Madeleine was sitting on a chair beside the bed. She turned towards\nhim; she was making a visible effort to be calm and \"very good,\" as she\nexpressed it in the feebleness of illness which resembles infancy, in\norder that, seeing her so peaceable, they might make no difficulty about\nbringing Cosette to her. But while she controlled herself she could not\nrefrain from questioning M. Madeleine.\n\n\"Did you have a pleasant trip, Monsieur le Maire? Oh! how good you were\nto go and get her for me! Only tell me how she is. Did she stand the\njourney well? Alas! she will not recognize me. She must have forgotten\nme by this time, poor darling! Children have no memories. They are like\nbirds. A child sees one thing to-day and another thing to-morrow, and\nthinks of nothing any longer. And did she have white linen? Did those\nThenardiers keep her clean? How have they fed her? Oh! if you only knew\nhow I have suffered, putting such questions as that to myself during all\nthe time of my wretchedness. Now, it is all past. I am happy. Oh, how I\nshould like to see her! Do you think her pretty, Monsieur le Maire?\nIs not my daughter beautiful? You must have been very cold in that\ndiligence! Could she not be brought for just one little instant? She\nmight be taken away directly afterwards. Tell me; you are the master; it\ncould be so if you chose!\"\n\nHe took her hand. \"Cosette is beautiful,\" he said, \"Cosette is well.\nYou shall see her soon; but calm yourself; you are talking with too much\nvivacity, and you are throwing your arms out from under the clothes, and\nthat makes you cough.\"\n\nIn fact, fits of coughing interrupted Fantine at nearly every word.\n\nFantine did not murmur; she feared that she had injured by her too\npassionate lamentations the confidence which she was desirous of\ninspiring, and she began to talk of indifferent things.\n\n\"Montfermeil is quite pretty, is it not? People go there on pleasure\nparties in summer. Are the Thenardiers prosperous? There are not many\ntravellers in their parts. That inn of theirs is a sort of a cook-shop.\"\n\nM. Madeleine was still holding her hand, and gazing at her with anxiety;\nit was evident that he had come to tell her things before which his mind\nnow hesitated. The doctor, having finished his visit, retired. Sister\nSimplice remained alone with them.\n\nBut in the midst of this pause Fantine exclaimed:--\n\n\"I hear her! mon Dieu, I hear her!\"\n\nShe stretched out her arm to enjoin silence about her, held her breath,\nand began to listen with rapture.\n\nThere was a child playing in the yard--the child of the portress or\nof some work-woman. It was one of those accidents which are always\noccurring, and which seem to form a part of the mysterious stage-setting\nof mournful scenes. The child--a little girl--was going and coming,\nrunning to warm herself, laughing, singing at the top of her voice.\nAlas! in what are the plays of children not intermingled. It was this\nlittle girl whom Fantine heard singing.\n\n\"Oh!\" she resumed, \"it is my Cosette! I recognize her voice.\"\n\nThe child retreated as it had come; the voice died away. Fantine\nlistened for a while longer, then her face clouded over, and M.\nMadeleine heard her say, in a low voice: \"How wicked that doctor is not\nto allow me to see my daughter! That man has an evil countenance, that\nhe has.\"\n\nBut the smiling background of her thoughts came to the front again. She\ncontinued to talk to herself, with her head resting on the pillow: \"How\nhappy we are going to be! We shall have a little garden the very first\nthing; M. Madeleine has promised it to me. My daughter will play in the\ngarden. She must know her letters by this time. I will make her spell.\nShe will run over the grass after butterflies. I will watch her. Then\nshe will take her first communion. Ah! when will she take her first\ncommunion?\"\n\nShe began to reckon on her fingers.\n\n\"One, two, three, four--she is seven years old. In five years she will\nhave a white veil, and openwork stockings; she will look like a little\nwoman. O my good sister, you do not know how foolish I become when I\nthink of my daughter's first communion!\"\n\nShe began to laugh.\n\nHe had released Fantine's hand. He listened to her words as one listens\nto the sighing of the breeze, with his eyes on the ground, his mind\nabsorbed in reflection which had no bottom. All at once she ceased\nspeaking, and this caused him to raise his head mechanically. Fantine\nhad become terrible.\n\nShe no longer spoke, she no longer breathed; she had raised herself to\na sitting posture, her thin shoulder emerged from her chemise; her face,\nwhich had been radiant but a moment before, was ghastly, and she\nseemed to have fixed her eyes, rendered large with terror, on something\nalarming at the other extremity of the room.\n\n\"Good God!\" he exclaimed; \"what ails you, Fantine?\"\n\nShe made no reply; she did not remove her eyes from the object which\nshe seemed to see. She removed one hand from his arm, and with the other\nmade him a sign to look behind him.\n\nHe turned, and beheld Javert.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III--JAVERT SATISFIED\n\nThis is what had taken place.\n\nThe half-hour after midnight had just struck when M. Madeleine quitted\nthe Hall of Assizes in Arras. He regained his inn just in time to set\nout again by the mail-wagon, in which he had engaged his place. A little\nbefore six o'clock in the morning he had arrived at M. sur M., and his\nfirst care had been to post a letter to M. Laffitte, then to enter the\ninfirmary and see Fantine.\n\nHowever, he had hardly quitted the audience hall of the Court of\nAssizes, when the district-attorney, recovering from his first shock,\nhad taken the word to deplore the mad deed of the honorable mayor of\nM. sur M., to declare that his convictions had not been in the least\nmodified by that curious incident, which would be explained thereafter,\nand to demand, in the meantime, the condemnation of that Champmathieu,\nwho was evidently the real Jean Valjean. The district-attorney's\npersistence was visibly at variance with the sentiments of every one, of\nthe public, of the court, and of the jury. The counsel for the defence\nhad some difficulty in refuting this harangue and in establishing that,\nin consequence of the revelations of M. Madeleine, that is to say, of\nthe real Jean Valjean, the aspect of the matter had been thoroughly\naltered, and that the jury had before their eyes now only an innocent\nman. Thence the lawyer had drawn some epiphonemas, not very fresh,\nunfortunately, upon judicial errors, etc., etc.; the President, in his\nsumming up, had joined the counsel for the defence, and in a few minutes\nthe jury had thrown Champmathieu out of the case.\n\nNevertheless, the district-attorney was bent on having a Jean Valjean;\nand as he had no longer Champmathieu, he took Madeleine.\n\nImmediately after Champmathieu had been set at liberty, the\ndistrict-attorney shut himself up with the President. They conferred \"as\nto the necessity of seizing the person of M. le Maire of M. sur M.\"\nThis phrase, in which there was a great deal of of, is the\ndistrict-attorney's, written with his own hand, on the minutes of his\nreport to the attorney-general. His first emotion having passed off, the\nPresident did not offer many objections. Justice must, after all, take\nits course. And then, when all was said, although the President was\na kindly and a tolerably intelligent man, he was, at the same time, a\ndevoted and almost an ardent royalist, and he had been shocked to hear\nthe Mayor of M. sur M. say the Emperor, and not Bonaparte, when alluding\nto the landing at Cannes.\n\nThe order for his arrest was accordingly despatched. The\ndistrict-attorney forwarded it to M. sur M. by a special messenger, at\nfull speed, and entrusted its execution to Police Inspector Javert.\n\nThe reader knows that Javert had returned to M. sur M. immediately after\nhaving given his deposition.\n\nJavert was just getting out of bed when the messenger handed him the\norder of arrest and the command to produce the prisoner.\n\nThe messenger himself was a very clever member of the police, who, in\ntwo words, informed Javert of what had taken place at Arras. The order\nof arrest, signed by the district-attorney, was couched in these words:\n\"Inspector Javert will apprehend the body of the Sieur Madeleine, mayor\nof M. sur M., who, in this day's session of the court, was recognized as\nthe liberated convict, Jean Valjean.\"\n\nAny one who did not know Javert, and who had chanced to see him at the\nmoment when he penetrated the antechamber of the infirmary, could have\ndivined nothing of what had taken place, and would have thought his air\nthe most ordinary in the world. He was cool, calm, grave, his gray\nhair was perfectly smooth upon his temples, and he had just mounted\nthe stairs with his habitual deliberation. Any one who was thoroughly\nacquainted with him, and who had examined him attentively at the moment,\nwould have shuddered. The buckle of his leather stock was under his\nleft ear instead of at the nape of his neck. This betrayed unwonted\nagitation.\n\nJavert was a complete character, who never had a wrinkle in his duty or\nin his uniform; methodical with malefactors, rigid with the buttons of\nhis coat.\n\nThat he should have set the buckle of his stock awry, it was\nindispensable that there should have taken place in him one of those\nemotions which may be designated as internal earthquakes.\n\nHe had come in a simple way, had made a requisition on the neighboring\npost for a corporal and four soldiers, had left the soldiers in the\ncourtyard, had had Fantine's room pointed out to him by the portress,\nwho was utterly unsuspicious, accustomed as she was to seeing armed men\ninquiring for the mayor.\n\nOn arriving at Fantine's chamber, Javert turned the handle, pushed\nthe door open with the gentleness of a sick-nurse or a police spy, and\nentered.\n\nProperly speaking, he did not enter. He stood erect in the half-open\ndoor, his hat on his head and his left hand thrust into his coat, which\nwas buttoned up to the chin. In the bend of his elbow the leaden head of\nhis enormous cane, which was hidden behind him, could be seen.\n\nThus he remained for nearly a minute, without his presence being\nperceived. All at once Fantine raised her eyes, saw him, and made M.\nMadeleine turn round.\n\nThe instant that Madeleine's glance encountered Javert's glance, Javert,\nwithout stirring, without moving from his post, without approaching him,\nbecame terrible. No human sentiment can be as terrible as joy.\n\nIt was the visage of a demon who has just found his damned soul.\n\nThe satisfaction of at last getting hold of Jean Valjean caused all that\nwas in his soul to appear in his countenance. The depths having been\nstirred up, mounted to the surface. The humiliation of having, in\nsome slight degree, lost the scent, and of having indulged, for a few\nmoments, in an error with regard to Champmathieu, was effaced by pride\nat having so well and accurately divined in the first place, and of\nhaving for so long cherished a just instinct. Javert's content shone\nforth in his sovereign attitude. The deformity of triumph overspread\nthat narrow brow. All the demonstrations of horror which a satisfied\nface can afford were there.\n\nJavert was in heaven at that moment. Without putting the thing clearly\nto himself, but with a confused intuition of the necessity of his\npresence and of his success, he, Javert, personified justice, light, and\ntruth in their celestial function of crushing out evil. Behind him and\naround him, at an infinite distance, he had authority, reason, the case\njudged, the legal conscience, the public prosecution, all the stars; he\nwas protecting order, he was causing the law to yield up its thunders,\nhe was avenging society, he was lending a helping hand to the absolute,\nhe was standing erect in the midst of a glory. There existed in his\nvictory a remnant of defiance and of combat. Erect, haughty, brilliant,\nhe flaunted abroad in open day the superhuman bestiality of a ferocious\narchangel. The terrible shadow of the action which he was accomplishing\ncaused the vague flash of the social sword to be visible in his clenched\nfist; happy and indignant, he held his heel upon crime, vice, rebellion,\nperdition, hell; he was radiant, he exterminated, he smiled, and there\nwas an incontestable grandeur in this monstrous Saint Michael.\n\nJavert, though frightful, had nothing ignoble about him.\n\nProbity, sincerity, candor, conviction, the sense of duty, are things\nwhich may become hideous when wrongly directed; but which, even when\nhideous, remain grand: their majesty, the majesty peculiar to the human\nconscience, clings to them in the midst of horror; they are virtues\nwhich have one vice,--error. The honest, pitiless joy of a fanatic\nin the full flood of his atrocity preserves a certain lugubriously\nvenerable radiance. Without himself suspecting the fact, Javert in his\nformidable happiness was to be pitied, as is every ignorant man who\ntriumphs. Nothing could be so poignant and so terrible as this face,\nwherein was displayed all that may be designated as the evil of the\ngood.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV--AUTHORITY REASSERTS ITS RIGHTS\n\nFantine had not seen Javert since the day on which the mayor had torn\nher from the man. Her ailing brain comprehended nothing, but the only\nthing which she did not doubt was that he had come to get her. She could\nnot endure that terrible face; she felt her life quitting her; she hid\nher face in both hands, and shrieked in her anguish:--\n\n\"Monsieur Madeleine, save me!\"\n\nJean Valjean--we shall henceforth not speak of him otherwise--had risen.\nHe said to Fantine in the gentlest and calmest of voices:--\n\n\"Be at ease; it is not for you that he is come.\"\n\nThen he addressed Javert, and said:--\n\n\"I know what you want.\"\n\nJavert replied:--\n\n\"Be quick about it!\"\n\nThere lay in the inflection of voice which accompanied these words\nsomething indescribably fierce and frenzied. Javert did not say, \"Be\nquick about it!\" he said \"Bequiabouit.\"\n\nNo orthography can do justice to the accent with which it was uttered:\nit was no longer a human word: it was a roar.\n\nHe did not proceed according to his custom, he did not enter into the\nmatter, he exhibited no warrant of arrest. In his eyes, Jean Valjean\nwas a sort of mysterious combatant, who was not to be laid hands upon,\na wrestler in the dark whom he had had in his grasp for the last five\nyears, without being able to throw him. This arrest was not a beginning,\nbut an end. He confined himself to saying, \"Be quick about it!\"\n\nAs he spoke thus, he did not advance a single step; he hurled at Jean\nValjean a glance which he threw out like a grappling-hook, and with\nwhich he was accustomed to draw wretches violently to him.\n\nIt was this glance which Fantine had felt penetrating to the very marrow\nof her bones two months previously.\n\nAt Javert's exclamation, Fantine opened her eyes once more. But the\nmayor was there; what had she to fear?\n\nJavert advanced to the middle of the room, and cried:--\n\n\"See here now! Art thou coming?\"\n\nThe unhappy woman glanced about her. No one was present excepting the\nnun and the mayor. To whom could that abject use of \"thou\" be addressed?\nTo her only. She shuddered.\n\nThen she beheld a most unprecedented thing, a thing so unprecedented\nthat nothing equal to it had appeared to her even in the blackest\ndeliriums of fever.\n\nShe beheld Javert, the police spy, seize the mayor by the collar; she\nsaw the mayor bow his head. It seemed to her that the world was coming\nto an end.\n\nJavert had, in fact, grasped Jean Valjean by the collar.\n\n\"Monsieur le Maire!\" shrieked Fantine.\n\nJavert burst out laughing with that frightful laugh which displayed all\nhis gums.\n\n\"There is no longer any Monsieur le Maire here!\"\n\nJean Valjean made no attempt to disengage the hand which grasped the\ncollar of his coat. He said:--\n\n\"Javert--\"\n\nJavert interrupted him: \"Call me Mr. Inspector.\"\n\n\"Monsieur,\" said Jean Valjean, \"I should like to say a word to you in\nprivate.\"\n\n\"Aloud! Say it aloud!\" replied Javert; \"people are in the habit of\ntalking aloud to me.\"\n\nJean Valjean went on in a lower tone:--\n\n\"I have a request to make of you--\"\n\n\"I tell you to speak loud.\"\n\n\"But you alone should hear it--\"\n\n\"What difference does that make to me? I shall not listen.\"\n\nJean Valjean turned towards him and said very rapidly and in a very low\nvoice:--\n\n\"Grant me three days' grace! three days in which to go and fetch the\nchild of this unhappy woman. I will pay whatever is necessary. You shall\naccompany me if you choose.\"\n\n\"You are making sport of me!\" cried Javert. \"Come now, I did not think\nyou such a fool! You ask me to give you three days in which to run away!\nYou say that it is for the purpose of fetching that creature's child!\nAh! Ah! That's good! That's really capital!\"\n\nFantine was seized with a fit of trembling.\n\n\"My child!\" she cried, \"to go and fetch my child! She is not here,\nthen! Answer me, sister; where is Cosette? I want my child! Monsieur\nMadeleine! Monsieur le Maire!\"\n\nJavert stamped his foot.\n\n\"And now there's the other one! Will you hold your tongue, you hussy?\nIt's a pretty sort of a place where convicts are magistrates, and where\nwomen of the town are cared for like countesses! Ah! But we are going to\nchange all that; it is high time!\"\n\nHe stared intently at Fantine, and added, once more taking into his\ngrasp Jean Valjean's cravat, shirt and collar:--\n\n\"I tell you that there is no Monsieur Madeleine and that there is no\nMonsieur le Maire. There is a thief, a brigand, a convict named Jean\nValjean! And I have him in my grasp! That's what there is!\"\n\nFantine raised herself in bed with a bound, supporting herself on her\nstiffened arms and on both hands: she gazed at Jean Valjean, she gazed\nat Javert, she gazed at the nun, she opened her mouth as though to\nspeak; a rattle proceeded from the depths of her throat, her teeth\nchattered; she stretched out her arms in her agony, opening her hands\nconvulsively, and fumbling about her like a drowning person; then\nsuddenly fell back on her pillow.\n\nHer head struck the head-board of the bed and fell forwards on her\nbreast, with gaping mouth and staring, sightless eyes.\n\nShe was dead.\n\nJean Valjean laid his hand upon the detaining hand of Javert, and opened\nit as he would have opened the hand of a baby; then he said to Javert:--\n\n\"You have murdered that woman.\"\n\n\"Let's have an end of this!\" shouted Javert, in a fury; \"I am not here\nto listen to argument. Let us economize all that; the guard is below;\nmarch on instantly, or you'll get the thumb-screws!\"\n\nIn the corner of the room stood an old iron bedstead, which was in a\ndecidedly decrepit state, and which served the sisters as a camp-bed\nwhen they were watching with the sick. Jean Valjean stepped up to this\nbed, in a twinkling wrenched off the head-piece, which was already in a\ndilapidated condition, an easy matter to muscles like his, grasped the\nprincipal rod like a bludgeon, and glanced at Javert. Javert retreated\ntowards the door. Jean Valjean, armed with his bar of iron, walked\nslowly up to Fantine's couch. When he arrived there he turned and said\nto Javert, in a voice that was barely audible:--\n\n\"I advise you not to disturb me at this moment.\"\n\nOne thing is certain, and that is, that Javert trembled.\n\nIt did occur to him to summon the guard, but Jean Valjean might avail\nhimself of that moment to effect his escape; so he remained, grasped\nhis cane by the small end, and leaned against the door-post, without\nremoving his eyes from Jean Valjean.\n\nJean Valjean rested his elbow on the knob at the head of the bed, and\nhis brow on his hand, and began to contemplate the motionless body of\nFantine, which lay extended there. He remained thus, mute, absorbed,\nevidently with no further thought of anything connected with this life.\nUpon his face and in his attitude there was nothing but inexpressible\npity. After a few moments of this meditation he bent towards Fantine,\nand spoke to her in a low voice.\n\nWhat did he say to her? What could this man, who was reproved, say to\nthat woman, who was dead? What words were those? No one on earth heard\nthem. Did the dead woman hear them? There are some touching illusions\nwhich are, perhaps, sublime realities. The point as to which there\nexists no doubt is, that Sister Simplice, the sole witness of the\nincident, often said that at the moment that Jean Valjean whispered in\nFantine's ear, she distinctly beheld an ineffable smile dawn on those\npale lips, and in those dim eyes, filled with the amazement of the tomb.\n\nJean Valjean took Fantine's head in both his hands, and arranged it on\nthe pillow as a mother might have done for her child; then he tied the\nstring of her chemise, and smoothed her hair back under her cap. That\ndone, he closed her eyes.\n\nFantine's face seemed strangely illuminated at that moment.\n\nDeath, that signifies entrance into the great light.\n\nFantine's hand was hanging over the side of the bed. Jean Valjean knelt\ndown before that hand, lifted it gently, and kissed it.\n\nThen he rose, and turned to Javert.\n\n\"Now,\" said he, \"I am at your disposal.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V--A SUITABLE TOMB\n\nJavert deposited Jean Valjean in the city prison.\n\nThe arrest of M. Madeleine occasioned a sensation, or rather, an\nextraordinary commotion in M. sur M. We are sorry that we cannot conceal\nthe fact, that at the single word, \"He was a convict,\" nearly every one\ndeserted him. In less than two hours all the good that he had done had\nbeen forgotten, and he was nothing but a \"convict from the galleys.\" It\nis just to add that the details of what had taken place at Arras were\nnot yet known. All day long conversations like the following were to be\nheard in all quarters of the town:--\n\n\"You don't know? He was a liberated convict!\" \"Who?\" \"The mayor.\" \"Bah!\nM. Madeleine?\" \"Yes.\" \"Really?\" \"His name was not Madeleine at all; he\nhad a frightful name, Bejean, Bojean, Boujean.\" \"Ah! Good God!\" \"He\nhas been arrested.\" \"Arrested!\" \"In prison, in the city prison, while\nwaiting to be transferred.\" \"Until he is transferred!\" \"He is to be\ntransferred!\" \"Where is he to be taken?\" \"He will be tried at the\nAssizes for a highway robbery which he committed long ago.\" \"Well! I\nsuspected as much. That man was too good, too perfect, too affected.\nHe refused the cross; he bestowed sous on all the little scamps he came\nacross. I always thought there was some evil history back of all that.\"\n\nThe \"drawing-rooms\" particularly abounded in remarks of this nature.\n\nOne old lady, a subscriber to the Drapeau Blanc, made the following\nremark, the depth of which it is impossible to fathom:--\n\n\"I am not sorry. It will be a lesson to the Bonapartists!\"\n\nIt was thus that the phantom which had been called M. Madeleine vanished\nfrom M. sur M. Only three or four persons in all the town remained\nfaithful to his memory. The old portress who had served him was among\nthe number.\n\nOn the evening of that day the worthy old woman was sitting in her\nlodge, still in a thorough fright, and absorbed in sad reflections.\nThe factory had been closed all day, the carriage gate was bolted, the\nstreet was deserted. There was no one in the house but the two nuns,\nSister Perpetue and Sister Simplice, who were watching beside the body\nof Fantine.\n\nTowards the hour when M. Madeleine was accustomed to return home,\nthe good portress rose mechanically, took from a drawer the key of\nM. Madeleine's chamber, and the flat candlestick which he used every\nevening to go up to his quarters; then she hung the key on the nail\nwhence he was accustomed to take it, and set the candlestick on one\nside, as though she was expecting him. Then she sat down again on her\nchair, and became absorbed in thought once more. The poor, good old\nwoman had done all this without being conscious of it.\n\nIt was only at the expiration of two hours that she roused herself from\nher revery, and exclaimed, \"Hold! My good God Jesus! And I hung his key\non the nail!\"\n\nAt that moment the small window in the lodge opened, a hand passed\nthrough, seized the key and the candlestick, and lighted the taper at\nthe candle which was burning there.\n\nThe portress raised her eyes, and stood there with gaping mouth, and a\nshriek which she confined to her throat.\n\nShe knew that hand, that arm, the sleeve of that coat.\n\nIt was M. Madeleine.\n\nIt was several seconds before she could speak; she had a seizure, as she\nsaid herself, when she related the adventure afterwards.\n\n\"Good God, Monsieur le Maire,\" she cried at last, \"I thought you were--\"\n\nShe stopped; the conclusion of her sentence would have been lacking in\nrespect towards the beginning. Jean Valjean was still Monsieur le Maire\nto her.\n\nHe finished her thought.\n\n\"In prison,\" said he. \"I was there; I broke a bar of one of the windows;\nI let myself drop from the top of a roof, and here I am. I am going up\nto my room; go and find Sister Simplice for me. She is with that poor\nwoman, no doubt.\"\n\nThe old woman obeyed in all haste.\n\nHe gave her no orders; he was quite sure that she would guard him better\nthan he should guard himself.\n\nNo one ever found out how he had managed to get into the courtyard\nwithout opening the big gates. He had, and always carried about him,\na pass-key which opened a little side-door; but he must have been\nsearched, and his latch-key must have been taken from him. This point\nwas never explained.\n\nHe ascended the staircase leading to his chamber. On arriving at the\ntop, he left his candle on the top step of his stairs, opened his door\nwith very little noise, went and closed his window and his shutters by\nfeeling, then returned for his candle and re-entered his room.\n\nIt was a useful precaution; it will be recollected that his window could\nbe seen from the street.\n\nHe cast a glance about him, at his table, at his chair, at his bed which\nhad not been disturbed for three days. No trace of the disorder of the\nnight before last remained. The portress had \"done up\" his room; only\nshe had picked out of the ashes and placed neatly on the table the two\niron ends of the cudgel and the forty-sou piece which had been blackened\nby the fire.\n\nHe took a sheet of paper, on which he wrote: \"These are the two tips of\nmy iron-shod cudgel and the forty-sou piece stolen from Little Gervais,\nwhich I mentioned at the Court of Assizes,\" and he arranged this piece\nof paper, the bits of iron, and the coin in such a way that they were\nthe first things to be seen on entering the room. From a cupboard he\npulled out one of his old shirts, which he tore in pieces. In the\nstrips of linen thus prepared he wrapped the two silver candlesticks. He\nbetrayed neither haste nor agitation; and while he was wrapping up the\nBishop's candlesticks, he nibbled at a piece of black bread. It was\nprobably the prison-bread which he had carried with him in his flight.\n\nThis was proved by the crumbs which were found on the floor of the room\nwhen the authorities made an examination later on.\n\nThere came two taps at the door.\n\n\"Come in,\" said he.\n\nIt was Sister Simplice.\n\nShe was pale; her eyes were red; the candle which she carried trembled\nin her hand. The peculiar feature of the violences of destiny is, that\nhowever polished or cool we may be, they wring human nature from our\nvery bowels, and force it to reappear on the surface. The emotions of\nthat day had turned the nun into a woman once more. She had wept, and\nshe was trembling.\n\nJean Valjean had just finished writing a few lines on a paper, which he\nhanded to the nun, saying, \"Sister, you will give this to Monsieur le\nCure.\"\n\nThe paper was not folded. She cast a glance upon it.\n\n\"You can read it,\" said he.\n\nShe read:--\n\n\"I beg Monsieur le Cure to keep an eye on all that I leave behind me. He\nwill be so good as to pay out of it the expenses of my trial, and of the\nfuneral of the woman who died yesterday. The rest is for the poor.\"\n\nThe sister tried to speak, but she only managed to stammer a few\ninarticulate sounds. She succeeded in saying, however:--\n\n\"Does not Monsieur le Maire desire to take a last look at that poor,\nunhappy woman?\"\n\n\"No,\" said he; \"I am pursued; it would only end in their arresting me in\nthat room, and that would disturb her.\"\n\nHe had hardly finished when a loud noise became audible on the\nstaircase. They heard a tumult of ascending footsteps, and the old\nportress saying in her loudest and most piercing tones:--\n\n\"My good sir, I swear to you by the good God, that not a soul has\nentered this house all day, nor all the evening, and that I have not\neven left the door.\"\n\nA man responded:--\n\n\"But there is a light in that room, nevertheless.\"\n\nThey recognized Javert's voice.\n\nThe chamber was so arranged that the door in opening masked the corner\nof the wall on the right. Jean Valjean blew out the light and placed\nhimself in this angle. Sister Simplice fell on her knees near the table.\n\nThe door opened.\n\nJavert entered.\n\nThe whispers of many men and the protestations of the portress were\naudible in the corridor.\n\nThe nun did not raise her eyes. She was praying.\n\nThe candle was on the chimney-piece, and gave but very little light.\n\nJavert caught sight of the nun and halted in amazement.\n\nIt will be remembered that the fundamental point in Javert, his element,\nthe very air he breathed, was veneration for all authority. This was\nimpregnable, and admitted of neither objection nor restriction. In his\neyes, of course, the ecclesiastical authority was the chief of all; he\nwas religious, superficial and correct on this point as on all others.\nIn his eyes, a priest was a mind, who never makes a mistake; a nun was a\ncreature who never sins; they were souls walled in from this world,\nwith a single door which never opened except to allow the truth to pass\nthrough.\n\nOn perceiving the sister, his first movement was to retire.\n\nBut there was also another duty which bound him and impelled him\nimperiously in the opposite direction. His second movement was to remain\nand to venture on at least one question.\n\nThis was Sister Simplice, who had never told a lie in her life. Javert\nknew it, and held her in special veneration in consequence.\n\n\"Sister,\" said he, \"are you alone in this room?\"\n\nA terrible moment ensued, during which the poor portress felt as though\nshe should faint.\n\nThe sister raised her eyes and answered:--\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Then,\" resumed Javert, \"you will excuse me if I persist; it is my duty;\nyou have not seen a certain person--a man--this evening? He has escaped;\nwe are in search of him--that Jean Valjean; you have not seen him?\"\n\nThe sister replied:--\n\n\"No.\"\n\nShe lied. She had lied twice in succession, one after the other, without\nhesitation, promptly, as a person does when sacrificing herself.\n\n\"Pardon me,\" said Javert, and he retired with a deep bow.\n\nO sainted maid! you left this world many years ago; you have rejoined\nyour sisters, the virgins, and your brothers, the angels, in the light;\nmay this lie be counted to your credit in paradise!\n\nThe sister's affirmation was for Javert so decisive a thing that he did\nnot even observe the singularity of that candle which had but just been\nextinguished, and which was still smoking on the table.\n\nAn hour later, a man, marching amid trees and mists, was rapidly\ndeparting from M. sur M. in the direction of Paris. That man was Jean\nValjean. It has been established by the testimony of two or three\ncarters who met him, that he was carrying a bundle; that he was dressed\nin a blouse. Where had he obtained that blouse? No one ever found out.\nBut an aged workman had died in the infirmary of the factory a few days\nbefore, leaving behind him nothing but his blouse. Perhaps that was the\none.\n\nOne last word about Fantine.\n\nWe all have a mother,--the earth. Fantine was given back to that mother.\n\nThe cure thought that he was doing right, and perhaps he really was, in\nreserving as much money as possible from what Jean Valjean had left for\nthe poor. Who was concerned, after all? A convict and a woman of the\ntown. That is why he had a very simple funeral for Fantine, and reduced\nit to that strictly necessary form known as the pauper's grave.\n\nSo Fantine was buried in the free corner of the cemetery which belongs\nto anybody and everybody, and where the poor are lost. Fortunately, God\nknows where to find the soul again. Fantine was laid in the shade,\namong the first bones that came to hand; she was subjected to the\npromiscuousness of ashes. She was thrown into the public grave. Her\ngrave resembled her bed.\n\n\n[THE END OF VOLUME I. \"FANTINE\"]\n\n\n[Illustration: Frontispiece Volume Two  2frontispiece]\n\n[Illustration: Titlepage Volume Two  2titlepage]\n\n\n\n\n\nVOLUME II.--COSETTE\n\n\n\n\nBOOK FIRST.--WATERLOO\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I--WHAT IS MET WITH ON THE WAY FROM NIVELLES\n\nLast year (1861), on a beautiful May morning, a traveller, the person\nwho is telling this story, was coming from Nivelles, and directing his\ncourse towards La Hulpe. He was on foot. He was pursuing a broad paved\nroad, which undulated between two rows of trees, over the hills which\nsucceed each other, raise the road and let it fall again, and produce\nsomething in the nature of enormous waves.\n\nHe had passed Lillois and Bois-Seigneur-Isaac. In the west he perceived\nthe slate-roofed tower of Braine-l'Alleud, which has the form of a\nreversed vase. He had just left behind a wood upon an eminence; and\nat the angle of the cross-road, by the side of a sort of mouldy gibbet\nbearing the inscription Ancient Barrier No. 4, a public house, bearing\non its front this sign: At the Four Winds (Aux Quatre Vents). Echabeau,\nPrivate Cafe.\n\nA quarter of a league further on, he arrived at the bottom of a little\nvalley, where there is water which passes beneath an arch made through\nthe embankment of the road. The clump of sparsely planted but very green\ntrees, which fills the valley on one side of the road, is dispersed over\nthe meadows on the other, and disappears gracefully and as in order in\nthe direction of Braine-l'Alleud.\n\nOn the right, close to the road, was an inn, with a four-wheeled cart\nat the door, a large bundle of hop-poles, a plough, a heap of dried\nbrushwood near a flourishing hedge, lime smoking in a square hole, and\na ladder suspended along an old penthouse with straw partitions. A young\ngirl was weeding in a field, where a huge yellow poster, probably of\nsome outside spectacle, such as a parish festival, was fluttering in\nthe wind. At one corner of the inn, beside a pool in which a flotilla\nof ducks was navigating, a badly paved path plunged into the bushes. The\nwayfarer struck into this.\n\nAfter traversing a hundred paces, skirting a wall of the fifteenth\ncentury, surmounted by a pointed gable, with bricks set in contrast, he\nfound himself before a large door of arched stone, with a rectilinear\nimpost, in the sombre style of Louis XIV., flanked by two flat\nmedallions. A severe facade rose above this door; a wall, perpendicular\nto the facade, almost touched the door, and flanked it with an abrupt\nright angle. In the meadow before the door lay three harrows, through\nwhich, in disorder, grew all the flowers of May. The door was closed.\nThe two decrepit leaves which barred it were ornamented with an old\nrusty knocker.\n\nThe sun was charming; the branches had that soft shivering of May,\nwhich seems to proceed rather from the nests than from the wind. A brave\nlittle bird, probably a lover, was carolling in a distracted manner in a\nlarge tree.\n\nThe wayfarer bent over and examined a rather large circular excavation,\nresembling the hollow of a sphere, in the stone on the left, at the foot\nof the pier of the door.\n\nAt this moment the leaves of the door parted, and a peasant woman\nemerged.\n\nShe saw the wayfarer, and perceived what he was looking at.\n\n\"It was a French cannon-ball which made that,\" she said to him. And she\nadded:--\n\n\"That which you see there, higher up in the door, near a nail, is the\nhole of a big iron bullet as large as an egg. The bullet did not pierce\nthe wood.\"\n\n\"What is the name of this place?\" inquired the wayfarer.\n\n\"Hougomont,\" said the peasant woman.\n\nThe traveller straightened himself up. He walked on a few paces, and\nwent off to look over the tops of the hedges. On the horizon through the\ntrees, he perceived a sort of little elevation, and on this elevation\nsomething which at that distance resembled a lion.\n\nHe was on the battle-field of Waterloo.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II--HOUGOMONT\n\nHougomont,--this was a funereal spot, the beginning of the obstacle,\nthe first resistance, which that great wood-cutter of Europe, called\nNapoleon, encountered at Waterloo, the first knot under the blows of his\naxe.\n\nIt was a chateau; it is no longer anything but a farm. For the\nantiquary, Hougomont is Hugomons. This manor was built by Hugo, Sire\nof Somerel, the same who endowed the sixth chaplaincy of the Abbey of\nVilliers.\n\nThe traveller pushed open the door, elbowed an ancient calash under the\nporch, and entered the courtyard.\n\nThe first thing which struck him in this paddock was a door of the\nsixteenth century, which here simulates an arcade, everything else\nhaving fallen prostrate around it. A monumental aspect often has its\nbirth in ruin. In a wall near the arcade opens another arched door, of\nthe time of Henry IV., permitting a glimpse of the trees of an orchard;\nbeside this door, a manure-hole, some pickaxes, some shovels, some\ncarts, an old well, with its flagstone and its iron reel, a chicken\njumping, and a turkey spreading its tail, a chapel surmounted by a small\nbell-tower, a blossoming pear-tree trained in espalier against the\nwall of the chapel--behold the court, the conquest of which was one of\nNapoleon's dreams. This corner of earth, could he but have seized\nit, would, perhaps, have given him the world likewise. Chickens are\nscattering its dust abroad with their beaks. A growl is audible; it is a\nhuge dog, who shows his teeth and replaces the English.\n\nThe English behaved admirably there. Cooke's four companies of guards\nthere held out for seven hours against the fury of an army.\n\nHougomont viewed on the map, as a geometrical plan, comprising buildings\nand enclosures, presents a sort of irregular rectangle, one angle of\nwhich is nicked out. It is this angle which contains the southern\ndoor, guarded by this wall, which commands it only a gun's length away.\nHougomont has two doors,--the southern door, that of the chateau; and\nthe northern door, belonging to the farm. Napoleon sent his brother\nJerome against Hougomont; the divisions of Foy, Guilleminot, and Bachelu\nhurled themselves against it; nearly the entire corps of Reille was\nemployed against it, and miscarried; Kellermann's balls were exhausted\non this heroic section of wall. Bauduin's brigade was not strong enough\nto force Hougomont on the north, and the brigade of Soye could not do\nmore than effect the beginning of a breach on the south, but without\ntaking it.\n\nThe farm buildings border the courtyard on the south. A bit of the north\ndoor, broken by the French, hangs suspended to the wall. It consists of\nfour planks nailed to two cross-beams, on which the scars of the attack\nare visible.\n\nThe northern door, which was beaten in by the French, and which has had\na piece applied to it to replace the panel suspended on the wall, stands\nhalf-open at the bottom of the paddock; it is cut squarely in the wall,\nbuilt of stone below, of brick above which closes in the courtyard on\nthe north. It is a simple door for carts, such as exist in all farms,\nwith the two large leaves made of rustic planks: beyond lie the meadows.\nThe dispute over this entrance was furious. For a long time, all sorts\nof imprints of bloody hands were visible on the door-posts. It was there\nthat Bauduin was killed.\n\nThe storm of the combat still lingers in this courtyard; its horror is\nvisible there; the confusion of the fray was petrified there; it lives\nand it dies there; it was only yesterday. The walls are in the death\nagony, the stones fall; the breaches cry aloud; the holes are wounds;\nthe drooping, quivering trees seem to be making an effort to flee.\n\nThis courtyard was more built up in 1815 than it is to-day. Buildings\nwhich have since been pulled down then formed redans and angles.\n\nThe English barricaded themselves there; the French made their way in,\nbut could not stand their ground. Beside the chapel, one wing of the\nchateau, the only ruin now remaining of the manor of Hougomont, rises in\na crumbling state,--disembowelled, one might say. The chateau served\nfor a dungeon, the chapel for a block-house. There men exterminated each\nother. The French, fired on from every point,--from behind the walls,\nfrom the summits of the garrets, from the depths of the cellars, through\nall the casements, through all the air-holes, through every crack in the\nstones,--fetched fagots and set fire to walls and men; the reply to the\ngrape-shot was a conflagration.\n\nIn the ruined wing, through windows garnished with bars of iron, the\ndismantled chambers of the main building of brick are visible; the\nEnglish guards were in ambush in these rooms; the spiral of the\nstaircase, cracked from the ground floor to the very roof, appears\nlike the inside of a broken shell. The staircase has two stories; the\nEnglish, besieged on the staircase, and massed on its upper steps, had\ncut off the lower steps. These consisted of large slabs of blue stone,\nwhich form a heap among the nettles. Half a score of steps still\ncling to the wall; on the first is cut the figure of a trident. These\ninaccessible steps are solid in their niches. All the rest resembles a\njaw which has been denuded of its teeth. There are two old trees there:\none is dead; the other is wounded at its base, and is clothed with\nverdure in April. Since 1815 it has taken to growing through the\nstaircase.\n\nA massacre took place in the chapel. The interior, which has recovered\nits calm, is singular. The mass has not been said there since the\ncarnage. Nevertheless, the altar has been left there--an altar of\nunpolished wood, placed against a background of roughhewn stone. Four\nwhitewashed walls, a door opposite the altar, two small arched windows;\nover the door a large wooden crucifix, below the crucifix a square\nair-hole stopped up with a bundle of hay; on the ground, in one corner,\nan old window-frame with the glass all broken to pieces--such is the\nchapel. Near the altar there is nailed up a wooden statue of Saint Anne,\nof the fifteenth century; the head of the infant Jesus has been carried\noff by a large ball. The French, who were masters of the chapel for a\nmoment, and were then dislodged, set fire to it. The flames filled this\nbuilding; it was a perfect furnace; the door was burned, the floor was\nburned, the wooden Christ was not burned. The fire preyed upon his\nfeet, of which only the blackened stumps are now to be seen; then it\nstopped,--a miracle, according to the assertion of the people of the\nneighborhood. The infant Jesus, decapitated, was less fortunate than the\nChrist.\n\nThe walls are covered with inscriptions. Near the feet of Christ this\nname is to be read: Henquinez. Then these others: Conde de Rio Maior\nMarques y Marquesa de Almagro (Habana). There are French names with\nexclamation points,--a sign of wrath. The wall was freshly whitewashed\nin 1849. The nations insulted each other there.\n\nIt was at the door of this chapel that the corpse was picked up which\nheld an axe in its hand; this corpse was Sub-Lieutenant Legros.\n\nOn emerging from the chapel, a well is visible on the left. There are\ntwo in this courtyard. One inquires, Why is there no bucket and pulley\nto this? It is because water is no longer drawn there. Why is water not\ndrawn there? Because it is full of skeletons.\n\nThe last person who drew water from the well was named Guillaume van\nKylsom. He was a peasant who lived at Hougomont, and was gardener there.\nOn the 18th of June, 1815, his family fled and concealed themselves in\nthe woods.\n\nThe forest surrounding the Abbey of Villiers sheltered these unfortunate\npeople who had been scattered abroad, for many days and nights. There\nare at this day certain traces recognizable, such as old boles of burned\ntrees, which mark the site of these poor bivouacs trembling in the\ndepths of the thickets.\n\nGuillaume van Kylsom remained at Hougomont, \"to guard the chateau,\" and\nconcealed himself in the cellar. The English discovered him there.\nThey tore him from his hiding-place, and the combatants forced this\nfrightened man to serve them, by administering blows with the flats of\ntheir swords. They were thirsty; this Guillaume brought them water. It\nwas from this well that he drew it. Many drank there their last draught.\nThis well where drank so many of the dead was destined to die itself.\n\nAfter the engagement, they were in haste to bury the dead bodies. Death\nhas a fashion of harassing victory, and she causes the pest to follow\nglory. The typhus is a concomitant of triumph. This well was deep, and\nit was turned into a sepulchre. Three hundred dead bodies were cast into\nit. With too much haste perhaps. Were they all dead? Legend says they\nwere not. It seems that on the night succeeding the interment, feeble\nvoices were heard calling from the well.\n\nThis well is isolated in the middle of the courtyard. Three walls, part\nstone, part brick, and simulating a small, square tower, and folded like\nthe leaves of a screen, surround it on all sides. The fourth side is\nopen. It is there that the water was drawn. The wall at the bottom has\na sort of shapeless loophole, possibly the hole made by a shell. This\nlittle tower had a platform, of which only the beams remain. The iron\nsupports of the well on the right form a cross. On leaning over, the\neye is lost in a deep cylinder of brick which is filled with a heaped-up\nmass of shadows. The base of the walls all about the well is concealed\nin a growth of nettles.\n\nThis well has not in front of it that large blue slab which forms the\ntable for all wells in Belgium. The slab has here been replaced by a\ncross-beam, against which lean five or six shapeless fragments of knotty\nand petrified wood which resemble huge bones. There is no longer either\npail, chain, or pulley; but there is still the stone basin which served\nthe overflow. The rain-water collects there, and from time to time a\nbird of the neighboring forests comes thither to drink, and then flies\naway. One house in this ruin, the farmhouse, is still inhabited. The\ndoor of this house opens on the courtyard. Upon this door, beside a\npretty Gothic lock-plate, there is an iron handle with trefoils placed\nslanting. At the moment when the Hanoverian lieutenant, Wilda, grasped\nthis handle in order to take refuge in the farm, a French sapper hewed\noff his hand with an axe.\n\nThe family who occupy the house had for their grandfather Guillaume van\nKylsom, the old gardener, dead long since. A woman with gray hair said\nto us: \"I was there. I was three years old. My sister, who was older,\nwas terrified and wept. They carried us off to the woods. I went there\nin my mother's arms. We glued our ears to the earth to hear. I imitated\nthe cannon, and went boum! boum!\"\n\nA door opening from the courtyard on the left led into the orchard, so\nwe were told. The orchard is terrible.\n\nIt is in three parts; one might almost say, in three acts. The first\npart is a garden, the second is an orchard, the third is a wood. These\nthree parts have a common enclosure: on the side of the entrance, the\nbuildings of the chateau and the farm; on the left, a hedge; on the\nright, a wall; and at the end, a wall. The wall on the right is of\nbrick, the wall at the bottom is of stone. One enters the garden first.\nIt slopes downwards, is planted with gooseberry bushes, choked with a\nwild growth of vegetation, and terminated by a monumental terrace of cut\nstone, with balustrade with a double curve.\n\nIt was a seignorial garden in the first French style which preceded Le\nNotre; to-day it is ruins and briars. The pilasters are surmounted by\nglobes which resemble cannon-balls of stone. Forty-three balusters can\nstill be counted on their sockets; the rest lie prostrate in the grass.\nAlmost all bear scratches of bullets. One broken baluster is placed on\nthe pediment like a fractured leg.\n\nIt was in this garden, further down than the orchard, that six\nlight-infantry men of the 1st, having made their way thither, and being\nunable to escape, hunted down and caught like bears in their dens,\naccepted the combat with two Hanoverian companies, one of which was\narmed with carbines. The Hanoverians lined this balustrade and fired\nfrom above. The infantry men, replying from below, six against two\nhundred, intrepid and with no shelter save the currant-bushes, took a\nquarter of an hour to die.\n\nOne mounts a few steps and passes from the garden into the orchard,\nproperly speaking. There, within the limits of those few square fathoms,\nfifteen hundred men fell in less than an hour. The wall seems ready\nto renew the combat. Thirty-eight loopholes, pierced by the English at\nirregular heights, are there still. In front of the sixth are placed two\nEnglish tombs of granite. There are loopholes only in the south wall, as\nthe principal attack came from that quarter. The wall is hidden on the\noutside by a tall hedge; the French came up, thinking that they had to\ndeal only with a hedge, crossed it, and found the wall both an obstacle\nand an ambuscade, with the English guards behind it, the thirty-eight\nloopholes firing at once a shower of grape-shot and balls, and Soye's\nbrigade was broken against it. Thus Waterloo began.\n\nNevertheless, the orchard was taken. As they had no ladders, the French\nscaled it with their nails. They fought hand to hand amid the trees.\nAll this grass has been soaked in blood. A battalion of Nassau, seven\nhundred strong, was overwhelmed there. The outside of the wall, against\nwhich Kellermann's two batteries were trained, is gnawed by grape-shot.\n\nThis orchard is sentient, like others, in the month of May. It has its\nbuttercups and its daisies; the grass is tall there; the cart-horses\nbrowse there; cords of hair, on which linen is drying, traverse the\nspaces between the trees and force the passer-by to bend his head; one\nwalks over this uncultivated land, and one's foot dives into mole-holes.\nIn the middle of the grass one observes an uprooted tree-bole which lies\nthere all verdant. Major Blackmann leaned against it to die. Beneath\na great tree in the neighborhood fell the German general, Duplat,\ndescended from a French family which fled on the revocation of the Edict\nof Nantes. An aged and falling apple-tree leans far over to one side,\nits wound dressed with a bandage of straw and of clayey loam. Nearly all\nthe apple-trees are falling with age. There is not one which has not\nhad its bullet or its biscayan.[6] The skeletons of dead trees abound in\nthis orchard. Crows fly through their branches, and at the end of it is\na wood full of violets.\n\nBauduin, killed, Foy wounded, conflagration, massacre, carnage, a\nrivulet formed of English blood, French blood, German blood mingled\nin fury, a well crammed with corpses, the regiment of Nassau and the\nregiment of Brunswick destroyed, Duplat killed, Blackmann killed, the\nEnglish Guards mutilated, twenty French battalions, besides the forty\nfrom Reille's corps, decimated, three thousand men in that hovel of\nHougomont alone cut down, slashed to pieces, shot, burned, with their\nthroats cut,--and all this so that a peasant can say to-day to the\ntraveller: Monsieur, give me three francs, and if you like, I will\nexplain to you the affair of Waterloo!\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III--THE EIGHTEENTH OF JUNE, 1815\n\nLet us turn back,--that is one of the story-teller's rights,--and put\nourselves once more in the year 1815, and even a little earlier than\nthe epoch when the action narrated in the first part of this book took\nplace.\n\nIf it had not rained in the night between the 17th and the 18th of\nJune, 1815, the fate of Europe would have been different. A few drops\nof water, more or less, decided the downfall of Napoleon. All that\nProvidence required in order to make Waterloo the end of Austerlitz\nwas a little more rain, and a cloud traversing the sky out of season\nsufficed to make a world crumble.\n\nThe battle of Waterloo could not be begun until half-past eleven\no'clock, and that gave Blucher time to come up. Why? Because the ground\nwas wet. The artillery had to wait until it became a little firmer\nbefore they could manoeuvre.\n\nNapoleon was an artillery officer, and felt the effects of this. The\nfoundation of this wonderful captain was the man who, in the report to\nthe Directory on Aboukir, said: Such a one of our balls killed six men.\nAll his plans of battle were arranged for projectiles. The key to his\nvictory was to make the artillery converge on one point. He treated the\nstrategy of the hostile general like a citadel, and made a breach in it.\nHe overwhelmed the weak point with grape-shot; he joined and dissolved\nbattles with cannon. There was something of the sharpshooter in his\ngenius. To beat in squares, to pulverize regiments, to break lines, to\ncrush and disperse masses,--for him everything lay in this, to\nstrike, strike, strike incessantly,--and he intrusted this task to the\ncannon-ball. A redoubtable method, and one which, united with genius,\nrendered this gloomy athlete of the pugilism of war invincible for the\nspace of fifteen years.\n\nOn the 18th of June, 1815, he relied all the more on his artillery,\nbecause he had numbers on his side. Wellington had only one hundred and\nfifty-nine mouths of fire; Napoleon had two hundred and forty.\n\nSuppose the soil dry, and the artillery capable of moving, the action\nwould have begun at six o'clock in the morning. The battle would have\nbeen won and ended at two o'clock, three hours before the change of\nfortune in favor of the Prussians. What amount of blame attaches to\nNapoleon for the loss of this battle? Is the shipwreck due to the pilot?\n\nWas it the evident physical decline of Napoleon that complicated this\nepoch by an inward diminution of force? Had the twenty years of war worn\nout the blade as it had worn the scabbard, the soul as well as the body?\nDid the veteran make himself disastrously felt in the leader? In a word,\nwas this genius, as many historians of note have thought, suffering from\nan eclipse? Did he go into a frenzy in order to disguise his weakened\npowers from himself? Did he begin to waver under the delusion of\na breath of adventure? Had he become--a grave matter in a\ngeneral--unconscious of peril? Is there an age, in this class of\nmaterial great men, who may be called the giants of action, when genius\ngrows short-sighted? Old age has no hold on the geniuses of the ideal;\nfor the Dantes and Michael Angelos to grow old is to grow in greatness;\nis it to grow less for the Hannibals and the Bonapartes? Had Napoleon\nlost the direct sense of victory? Had he reached the point where he\ncould no longer recognize the reef, could no longer divine the snare, no\nlonger discern the crumbling brink of abysses? Had he lost his power of\nscenting out catastrophes? He who had in former days known all the\nroads to triumph, and who, from the summit of his chariot of lightning,\npointed them out with a sovereign finger, had he now reached that\nstate of sinister amazement when he could lead his tumultuous legions\nharnessed to it, to the precipice? Was he seized at the age of forty-six\nwith a supreme madness? Was that titanic charioteer of destiny no longer\nanything more than an immense dare-devil?\n\nWe do not think so.\n\nHis plan of battle was, by the confession of all, a masterpiece. To\ngo straight to the centre of the Allies' line, to make a breach in the\nenemy, to cut them in two, to drive the British half back on Hal,\nand the Prussian half on Tongres, to make two shattered fragments of\nWellington and Blucher, to carry Mont-Saint-Jean, to seize Brussels,\nto hurl the German into the Rhine, and the Englishman into the sea. All\nthis was contained in that battle, according to Napoleon. Afterwards\npeople would see.\n\nOf course, we do not here pretend to furnish a history of the battle of\nWaterloo; one of the scenes of the foundation of the story which we\nare relating is connected with this battle, but this history is not our\nsubject; this history, moreover, has been finished, and finished in a\nmasterly manner, from one point of view by Napoleon, and from another\npoint of view by a whole pleiad of historians.[7]\n\nAs for us, we leave the historians at loggerheads; we are but a distant\nwitness, a passer-by on the plain, a seeker bending over that soil all\nmade of human flesh, taking appearances for realities, perchance; we\nhave no right to oppose, in the name of science, a collection of facts\nwhich contain illusions, no doubt; we possess neither military practice\nnor strategic ability which authorize a system; in our opinion, a chain\nof accidents dominated the two leaders at Waterloo; and when it becomes\na question of destiny, that mysterious culprit, we judge like that\ningenious judge, the populace.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV--A\n\nThose persons who wish to gain a clear idea of the battle of Waterloo\nhave only to place, mentally, on the ground, a capital A. The left limb\nof the A is the road to Nivelles, the right limb is the road to Genappe,\nthe tie of the A is the hollow road to Ohain from Braine-l'Alleud. The\ntop of the A is Mont-Saint-Jean, where Wellington is; the lower left tip\nis Hougomont, where Reille is stationed with Jerome Bonaparte; the right\ntip is the Belle-Alliance, where Napoleon was. At the centre of this\nchord is the precise point where the final word of the battle was\npronounced. It was there that the lion has been placed, the involuntary\nsymbol of the supreme heroism of the Imperial Guard.\n\nThe triangle included in the top of the A, between the two limbs and the\ntie, is the plateau of Mont-Saint-Jean. The dispute over this plateau\nconstituted the whole battle. The wings of the two armies extended to\nthe right and left of the two roads to Genappe and Nivelles; d'Erlon\nfacing Picton, Reille facing Hill.\n\nBehind the tip of the A, behind the plateau of Mont-Saint-Jean, is the\nforest of Soignes.\n\nAs for the plain itself, let the reader picture to himself a vast\nundulating sweep of ground; each rise commands the next rise, and all\nthe undulations mount towards Mont-Saint-Jean, and there end in the\nforest.\n\nTwo hostile troops on a field of battle are two wrestlers. It is a\nquestion of seizing the opponent round the waist. The one seeks to trip\nup the other. They clutch at everything: a bush is a point of support;\nan angle of the wall offers them a rest to the shoulder; for the lack\nof a hovel under whose cover they can draw up, a regiment yields its\nground; an unevenness in the ground, a chance turn in the landscape, a\ncross-path encountered at the right moment, a grove, a ravine, can\nstay the heel of that colossus which is called an army, and prevent its\nretreat. He who quits the field is beaten; hence the necessity devolving\non the responsible leader, of examining the most insignificant clump of\ntrees, and of studying deeply the slightest relief in the ground.\n\nThe two generals had attentively studied the plain of Mont-Saint-Jean,\nnow called the plain of Waterloo. In the preceding year, Wellington,\nwith the sagacity of foresight, had examined it as the possible seat of\na great battle. Upon this spot, and for this duel, on the 18th of June,\nWellington had the good post, Napoleon the bad post. The English army\nwas stationed above, the French army below.\n\nIt is almost superfluous here to sketch the appearance of Napoleon on\nhorseback, glass in hand, upon the heights of Rossomme, at daybreak, on\nJune 18, 1815. All the world has seen him before we can show him.\nThat calm profile under the little three-cornered hat of the school of\nBrienne, that green uniform, the white revers concealing the star of the\nLegion of Honor, his great coat hiding his epaulets, the corner of red\nribbon peeping from beneath his vest, his leather trousers, the white\nhorse with the saddle-cloth of purple velvet bearing on the corners\ncrowned N's and eagles, Hessian boots over silk stockings, silver spurs,\nthe sword of Marengo,--that whole figure of the last of the Caesars is\npresent to all imaginations, saluted with acclamations by some, severely\nregarded by others.\n\nThat figure stood for a long time wholly in the light; this arose from\na certain legendary dimness evolved by the majority of heroes, and which\nalways veils the truth for a longer or shorter time; but to-day history\nand daylight have arrived.\n\nThat light called history is pitiless; it possesses this peculiar and\ndivine quality, that, pure light as it is, and precisely because it\nis wholly light, it often casts a shadow in places where people had\nhitherto beheld rays; from the same man it constructs two different\nphantoms, and the one attacks the other and executes justice on it, and\nthe shadows of the despot contend with the brilliancy of the leader.\nHence arises a truer measure in the definitive judgments of nations.\nBabylon violated lessens Alexander, Rome enchained lessens Caesar,\nJerusalem murdered lessens Titus, tyranny follows the tyrant. It is a\nmisfortune for a man to leave behind him the night which bears his form.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V--THE QUID OBSCURUM OF BATTLES\n\nEvery one is acquainted with the first phase of this battle; a beginning\nwhich was troubled, uncertain, hesitating, menacing to both armies, but\nstill more so for the English than for the French.\n\nIt had rained all night, the earth had been cut up by the downpour, the\nwater had accumulated here and there in the hollows of the plain as if\nin casks; at some points the gear of the artillery carriages was buried\nup to the axles, the circingles of the horses were dripping with liquid\nmud. If the wheat and rye trampled down by this cohort of transports\non the march had not filled in the ruts and strewn a litter beneath the\nwheels, all movement, particularly in the valleys, in the direction of\nPapelotte would have been impossible.\n\nThe affair began late. Napoleon, as we have already explained, was in\nthe habit of keeping all his artillery well in hand, like a pistol,\naiming it now at one point, now at another, of the battle; and it had\nbeen his wish to wait until the horse batteries could move and gallop\nfreely. In order to do that it was necessary that the sun should come\nout and dry the soil. But the sun did not make its appearance. It was\nno longer the rendezvous of Austerlitz. When the first cannon was fired,\nthe English general, Colville, looked at his watch, and noted that it\nwas thirty-five minutes past eleven.\n\nThe action was begun furiously, with more fury, perhaps, than the\nEmperor would have wished, by the left wing of the French resting on\nHougomont. At the same time Napoleon attacked the centre by hurling\nQuiot's brigade on La Haie-Sainte, and Ney pushed forward the right\nwing of the French against the left wing of the English, which rested on\nPapelotte.\n\nThe attack on Hougomont was something of a feint; the plan was to draw\nWellington thither, and to make him swerve to the left. This plan would\nhave succeeded if the four companies of the English guards and the brave\nBelgians of Perponcher's division had not held the position solidly, and\nWellington, instead of massing his troops there, could confine himself\nto despatching thither, as reinforcements, only four more companies of\nguards and one battalion from Brunswick.\n\nThe attack of the right wing of the French on Papelotte was calculated,\nin fact, to overthrow the English left, to cut off the road to Brussels,\nto bar the passage against possible Prussians, to force Mont-Saint-Jean,\nto turn Wellington back on Hougomont, thence on Braine-l'Alleud, thence\non Hal; nothing easier. With the exception of a few incidents this\nattack succeeded Papelotte was taken; La Haie-Sainte was carried.\n\nA detail to be noted. There was in the English infantry, particularly\nin Kempt's brigade, a great many raw recruits. These young soldiers were\nvaliant in the presence of our redoubtable infantry; their inexperience\nextricated them intrepidly from the dilemma; they performed particularly\nexcellent service as skirmishers: the soldier skirmisher, left somewhat\nto himself, becomes, so to speak, his own general. These recruits\ndisplayed some of the French ingenuity and fury. This novice of an\ninfantry had dash. This displeased Wellington.\n\nAfter the taking of La Haie-Sainte the battle wavered.\n\nThere is in this day an obscure interval, from mid-day to four o'clock;\nthe middle portion of this battle is almost indistinct, and participates\nin the sombreness of the hand-to-hand conflict. Twilight reigns over it.\nWe perceive vast fluctuations in that fog, a dizzy mirage, paraphernalia\nof war almost unknown to-day, pendant colbacks, floating sabre-taches,\ncross-belts, cartridge-boxes for grenades, hussar dolmans, red boots\nwith a thousand wrinkles, heavy shakos garlanded with torsades, the\nalmost black infantry of Brunswick mingled with the scarlet infantry\nof England, the English soldiers with great, white circular pads on the\nslopes of their shoulders for epaulets, the Hanoverian light-horse with\ntheir oblong casques of leather, with brass hands and red horse-tails,\nthe Scotch with their bare knees and plaids, the great white gaiters\nof our grenadiers; pictures, not strategic lines--what Salvator Rosa\nrequires, not what is suited to the needs of Gribeauval.\n\nA certain amount of tempest is always mingled with a battle. Quid\nobscurum, quid divinum. Each historian traces, to some extent, the\nparticular feature which pleases him amid this pell-mell. Whatever may\nbe the combinations of the generals, the shock of armed masses has an\nincalculable ebb. During the action the plans of the two leaders enter\ninto each other and become mutually thrown out of shape. Such a point of\nthe field of battle devours more combatants than such another, just as\nmore or less spongy soils soak up more or less quickly the water which\nis poured on them. It becomes necessary to pour out more soldiers than\none would like; a series of expenditures which are the unforeseen. The\nline of battle waves and undulates like a thread, the trails of blood\ngush illogically, the fronts of the armies waver, the regiments\nform capes and gulfs as they enter and withdraw; all these reefs are\ncontinually moving in front of each other. Where the infantry stood the\nartillery arrives, the cavalry rushes in where the artillery was, the\nbattalions are like smoke. There was something there; seek it. It has\ndisappeared; the open spots change place, the sombre folds advance and\nretreat, a sort of wind from the sepulchre pushes forward, hurls back,\ndistends, and disperses these tragic multitudes. What is a fray? an\noscillation? The immobility of a mathematical plan expresses a minute,\nnot a day. In order to depict a battle, there is required one of those\npowerful painters who have chaos in their brushes. Rembrandt is better\nthan Vandermeulen; Vandermeulen, exact at noon, lies at three o'clock.\nGeometry is deceptive; the hurricane alone is trustworthy. That is what\nconfers on Folard the right to contradict Polybius. Let us add, that\nthere is a certain instant when the battle degenerates into a combat,\nbecomes specialized, and disperses into innumerable detailed feats,\nwhich, to borrow the expression of Napoleon himself, \"belong rather to\nthe biography of the regiments than to the history of the army.\" The\nhistorian has, in this case, the evident right to sum up the whole. He\ncannot do more than seize the principal outlines of the struggle, and\nit is not given to any one narrator, however conscientious he may be,\nto fix, absolutely, the form of that horrible cloud which is called a\nbattle.\n\nThis, which is true of all great armed encounters, is particularly\napplicable to Waterloo.\n\nNevertheless, at a certain moment in the afternoon the battle came to a\npoint.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI--FOUR O'CLOCK IN THE AFTERNOON\n\nTowards four o'clock the condition of the English army was serious. The\nPrince of Orange was in command of the centre, Hill of the right wing,\nPicton of the left wing. The Prince of Orange, desperate and intrepid,\nshouted to the Hollando-Belgians: \"Nassau! Brunswick! Never retreat!\"\nHill, having been weakened, had come up to the support of Wellington;\nPicton was dead. At the very moment when the English had captured from\nthe French the flag of the 105th of the line, the French had killed the\nEnglish general, Picton, with a bullet through the head. The battle\nhad, for Wellington, two bases of action, Hougomont and La Haie-Sainte;\nHougomont still held out, but was on fire; La Haie-Sainte was taken. Of\nthe German battalion which defended it, only forty-two men survived; all\nthe officers, except five, were either dead or captured. Three thousand\ncombatants had been massacred in that barn. A sergeant of the English\nGuards, the foremost boxer in England, reputed invulnerable by his\ncompanions, had been killed there by a little French drummer-boy. Baring\nhad been dislodged, Alten put to the sword. Many flags had been lost,\none from Alten's division, and one from the battalion of Lunenburg,\ncarried by a prince of the house of Deux-Ponts. The Scotch Grays no\nlonger existed; Ponsonby's great dragoons had been hacked to pieces.\nThat valiant cavalry had bent beneath the lancers of Bro and beneath\nthe cuirassiers of Travers; out of twelve hundred horses, six\nhundred remained; out of three lieutenant-colonels, two lay on the\nearth,--Hamilton wounded, Mater slain. Ponsonby had fallen, riddled by\nseven lance-thrusts. Gordon was dead. Marsh was dead. Two divisions, the\nfifth and the sixth, had been annihilated.\n\nHougomont injured, La Haie-Sainte taken, there now existed but one\nrallying-point, the centre. That point still held firm. Wellington\nreinforced it. He summoned thither Hill, who was at Merle-Braine; he\nsummoned Chasse, who was at Braine-l'Alleud.\n\nThe centre of the English army, rather concave, very dense, and\nvery compact, was strongly posted. It occupied the plateau of\nMont-Saint-Jean, having behind it the village, and in front of it the\nslope, which was tolerably steep then. It rested on that stout stone\ndwelling which at that time belonged to the domain of Nivelles, and\nwhich marks the intersection of the roads--a pile of the sixteenth\ncentury, and so robust that the cannon-balls rebounded from it without\ninjuring it. All about the plateau the English had cut the hedges here\nand there, made embrasures in the hawthorn-trees, thrust the throat of\na cannon between two branches, embattled the shrubs. There artillery was\nambushed in the brushwood. This punic labor, incontestably authorized\nby war, which permits traps, was so well done, that Haxo, who had been\ndespatched by the Emperor at nine o'clock in the morning to reconnoitre\nthe enemy's batteries, had discovered nothing of it, and had returned\nand reported to Napoleon that there were no obstacles except the two\nbarricades which barred the road to Nivelles and to Genappe. It was\nat the season when the grain is tall; on the edge of the plateau a\nbattalion of Kempt's brigade, the 95th, armed with carabines, was\nconcealed in the tall wheat.\n\nThus assured and buttressed, the centre of the Anglo-Dutch army was well\nposted. The peril of this position lay in the forest of Soignes,\nthen adjoining the field of battle, and intersected by the ponds of\nGroenendael and Boitsfort. An army could not retreat thither without\ndissolving; the regiments would have broken up immediately there.\nThe artillery would have been lost among the morasses. The retreat,\naccording to many a man versed in the art,--though it is disputed by\nothers,--would have been a disorganized flight.\n\nTo this centre, Wellington added one of Chasse's brigades taken from the\nright wing, and one of Wincke's brigades taken from the left wing, plus\nClinton's division. To his English, to the regiments of Halkett, to\nthe brigades of Mitchell, to the guards of Maitland, he gave as\nreinforcements and aids, the infantry of Brunswick, Nassau's contingent,\nKielmansegg's Hanoverians, and Ompteda's Germans. This placed twenty-six\nbattalions under his hand. The right wing, as Charras says, was thrown\nback on the centre. An enormous battery was masked by sacks of earth at\nthe spot where there now stands what is called the \"Museum of Waterloo.\"\nBesides this, Wellington had, behind a rise in the ground, Somerset's\nDragoon Guards, fourteen hundred horse strong. It was the remaining half\nof the justly celebrated English cavalry. Ponsonby destroyed, Somerset\nremained.\n\nThe battery, which, if completed, would have been almost a redoubt, was\nranged behind a very low garden wall, backed up with a coating of bags\nof sand and a large slope of earth. This work was not finished; there\nhad been no time to make a palisade for it.\n\nWellington, uneasy but impassive, was on horseback, and there remained\nthe whole day in the same attitude, a little in advance of the old mill\nof Mont-Saint-Jean, which is still in existence, beneath an elm, which\nan Englishman, an enthusiastic vandal, purchased later on for two\nhundred francs, cut down, and carried off. Wellington was coldly heroic.\nThe bullets rained about him. His aide-de-camp, Gordon, fell at his\nside. Lord Hill, pointing to a shell which had burst, said to him: \"My\nlord, what are your orders in case you are killed?\" \"To do like me,\"\nreplied Wellington. To Clinton he said laconically, \"To hold this spot\nto the last man.\" The day was evidently turning out ill. Wellington\nshouted to his old companions of Talavera, of Vittoria, of Salamanca:\n\"Boys, can retreat be thought of? Think of old England!\"\n\nTowards four o'clock, the English line drew back. Suddenly nothing\nwas visible on the crest of the plateau except the artillery and the\nsharpshooters; the rest had disappeared: the regiments, dislodged by\nthe shells and the French bullets, retreated into the bottom, now\nintersected by the back road of the farm of Mont-Saint-Jean; a\nretrograde movement took place, the English front hid itself, Wellington\ndrew back. \"The beginning of retreat!\" cried Napoleon.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII--NAPOLEON IN A GOOD HUMOR\n\nThe Emperor, though ill and discommoded on horseback by a local trouble,\nhad never been in a better humor than on that day. His impenetrability\nhad been smiling ever since the morning. On the 18th of June, that\nprofound soul masked by marble beamed blindly. The man who had been\ngloomy at Austerlitz was gay at Waterloo. The greatest favorites of\ndestiny make mistakes. Our joys are composed of shadow. The supreme\nsmile is God's alone.\n\nRidet Caesar, Pompeius flebit, said the legionaries of the Fulminatrix\nLegion. Pompey was not destined to weep on that occasion, but it is\ncertain that Caesar laughed. While exploring on horseback at one o'clock\non the preceding night, in storm and rain, in company with Bertrand, the\ncommunes in the neighborhood of Rossomme, satisfied at the sight of the\nlong line of the English camp-fires illuminating the whole horizon from\nFrischemont to Braine-l'Alleud, it had seemed to him that fate, to\nwhom he had assigned a day on the field of Waterloo, was exact to\nthe appointment; he stopped his horse, and remained for some time\nmotionless, gazing at the lightning and listening to the thunder;\nand this fatalist was heard to cast into the darkness this mysterious\nsaying, \"We are in accord.\" Napoleon was mistaken. They were no longer\nin accord.\n\nHe took not a moment for sleep; every instant of that night was marked\nby a joy for him. He traversed the line of the principal outposts,\nhalting here and there to talk to the sentinels. At half-past two, near\nthe wood of Hougomont, he heard the tread of a column on the march; he\nthought at the moment that it was a retreat on the part of Wellington.\nHe said: \"It is the rear-guard of the English getting under way for the\npurpose of decamping. I will take prisoners the six thousand English who\nhave just arrived at Ostend.\" He conversed expansively; he regained the\nanimation which he had shown at his landing on the first of March, when\nhe pointed out to the Grand-Marshal the enthusiastic peasant of the Gulf\nJuan, and cried, \"Well, Bertrand, here is a reinforcement already!\" On\nthe night of the 17th to the 18th of June he rallied Wellington. \"That\nlittle Englishman needs a lesson,\" said Napoleon. The rain redoubled in\nviolence; the thunder rolled while the Emperor was speaking.\n\nAt half-past three o'clock in the morning, he lost one illusion;\nofficers who had been despatched to reconnoitre announced to him that\nthe enemy was not making any movement. Nothing was stirring; not a\nbivouac-fire had been extinguished; the English army was asleep. The\nsilence on earth was profound; the only noise was in the heavens.\nAt four o'clock, a peasant was brought in to him by the scouts; this\npeasant had served as guide to a brigade of English cavalry, probably\nVivian's brigade, which was on its way to take up a position in the\nvillage of Ohain, at the extreme left. At five o'clock, two Belgian\ndeserters reported to him that they had just quitted their regiment,\nand that the English army was ready for battle. \"So much the better!\"\nexclaimed Napoleon. \"I prefer to overthrow them rather than to drive\nthem back.\"\n\nIn the morning he dismounted in the mud on the slope which forms an\nangle with the Plancenoit road, had a kitchen table and a peasant's\nchair brought to him from the farm of Rossomme, seated himself, with a\ntruss of straw for a carpet, and spread out on the table the chart\nof the battle-field, saying to Soult as he did so, \"A pretty\nchecker-board.\"\n\nIn consequence of the rains during the night, the transports of\nprovisions, embedded in the soft roads, had not been able to arrive by\nmorning; the soldiers had had no sleep; they were wet and fasting. This\ndid not prevent Napoleon from exclaiming cheerfully to Ney, \"We have\nninety chances out of a hundred.\" At eight o'clock the Emperor's\nbreakfast was brought to him. He invited many generals to it. During\nbreakfast, it was said that Wellington had been to a ball two nights\nbefore, in Brussels, at the Duchess of Richmond's; and Soult, a rough\nman of war, with a face of an archbishop, said, \"The ball takes place\nto-day.\" The Emperor jested with Ney, who said, \"Wellington will not be\nso simple as to wait for Your Majesty.\" That was his way, however. \"He\nwas fond of jesting,\" says Fleury de Chaboulon. \"A merry humor was\nat the foundation of his character,\" says Gourgaud. \"He abounded in\npleasantries, which were more peculiar than witty,\" says Benjamin\nConstant. These gayeties of a giant are worthy of insistence. It was\nhe who called his grenadiers \"his grumblers\"; he pinched their ears; he\npulled their mustaches. \"The Emperor did nothing but play pranks on us,\"\nis the remark of one of them. During the mysterious trip from the island\nof Elba to France, on the 27th of February, on the open sea, the French\nbrig of war, Le Zephyr, having encountered the brig L'Inconstant, on\nwhich Napoleon was concealed, and having asked the news of Napoleon\nfrom L'Inconstant, the Emperor, who still wore in his hat the white and\namaranthine cockade sown with bees, which he had adopted at the isle of\nElba, laughingly seized the speaking-trumpet, and answered for himself,\n\"The Emperor is well.\" A man who laughs like that is on familiar terms\nwith events. Napoleon indulged in many fits of this laughter during the\nbreakfast at Waterloo. After breakfast he meditated for a quarter of an\nhour; then two generals seated themselves on the truss of straw, pen in\nhand and their paper on their knees, and the Emperor dictated to them\nthe order of battle.\n\nAt nine o'clock, at the instant when the French army, ranged in echelons\nand set in motion in five columns, had deployed--the divisions in two\nlines, the artillery between the brigades, the music at their head; as\nthey beat the march, with rolls on the drums and the blasts of trumpets,\nmighty, vast, joyous, a sea of casques, of sabres, and of bayonets on\nthe horizon, the Emperor was touched, and twice exclaimed, \"Magnificent!\nMagnificent!\"\n\nBetween nine o'clock and half-past ten the whole army, incredible as it\nmay appear, had taken up its position and ranged itself in six lines,\nforming, to repeat the Emperor's expression, \"the figure of six V's.\"\nA few moments after the formation of the battle-array, in the midst of\nthat profound silence, like that which heralds the beginning of a storm,\nwhich precedes engagements, the Emperor tapped Haxo on the shoulder, as\nhe beheld the three batteries of twelve-pounders, detached by his orders\nfrom the corps of Erlon, Reille, and Lobau, and destined to begin the\naction by taking Mont-Saint-Jean, which was situated at the intersection\nof the Nivelles and the Genappe roads, and said to him, \"There are four\nand twenty handsome maids, General.\"\n\nSure of the issue, he encouraged with a smile, as they passed before\nhim, the company of sappers of the first corps, which he had appointed\nto barricade Mont-Saint-Jean as soon as the village should be carried.\nAll this serenity had been traversed by but a single word of haughty\npity; perceiving on his left, at a spot where there now stands a large\ntomb, those admirable Scotch Grays, with their superb horses, massing\nthemselves, he said, \"It is a pity.\"\n\nThen he mounted his horse, advanced beyond Rossomme, and selected for\nhis post of observation a contracted elevation of turf to the right of\nthe road from Genappe to Brussels, which was his second station during\nthe battle. The third station, the one adopted at seven o'clock in the\nevening, between La Belle-Alliance and La Haie-Sainte, is formidable;\nit is a rather elevated knoll, which still exists, and behind which the\nguard was massed on a slope of the plain. Around this knoll the balls\nrebounded from the pavements of the road, up to Napoleon himself. As at\nBrienne, he had over his head the shriek of the bullets and of the\nheavy artillery. Mouldy cannon-balls, old sword-blades, and shapeless\nprojectiles, eaten up with rust, were picked up at the spot where his\nhorse' feet stood. Scabra rubigine. A few years ago, a shell of sixty\npounds, still charged, and with its fuse broken off level with the bomb,\nwas unearthed. It was at this last post that the Emperor said to his\nguide, Lacoste, a hostile and terrified peasant, who was attached to the\nsaddle of a hussar, and who turned round at every discharge of canister\nand tried to hide behind Napoleon: \"Fool, it is shameful! You'll get\nyourself killed with a ball in the back.\" He who writes these lines has\nhimself found, in the friable soil of this knoll, on turning over\nthe sand, the remains of the neck of a bomb, disintegrated, by the\noxidization of six and forty years, and old fragments of iron which\nparted like elder-twigs between the fingers.\n\nEvery one is aware that the variously inclined undulations of the\nplains, where the engagement between Napoleon and Wellington took place,\nare no longer what they were on June 18, 1815. By taking from this\nmournful field the wherewithal to make a monument to it, its real relief\nhas been taken away, and history, disconcerted, no longer finds her\nbearings there. It has been disfigured for the sake of glorifying\nit. Wellington, when he beheld Waterloo once more, two years later,\nexclaimed, \"They have altered my field of battle!\" Where the great\npyramid of earth, surmounted by the lion, rises to-day, there was a\nhillock which descended in an easy slope towards the Nivelles road, but\nwhich was almost an escarpment on the side of the highway to Genappe.\nThe elevation of this escarpment can still be measured by the height of\nthe two knolls of the two great sepulchres which enclose the road from\nGenappe to Brussels: one, the English tomb, is on the left; the other,\nthe German tomb, is on the right. There is no French tomb. The whole\nof that plain is a sepulchre for France. Thanks to the thousands upon\nthousands of cartloads of earth employed in the hillock one hundred and\nfifty feet in height and half a mile in circumference, the plateau\nof Mont-Saint-Jean is now accessible by an easy slope. On the day of\nbattle, particularly on the side of La Haie-Sainte, it was abrupt and\ndifficult of approach. The slope there is so steep that the English\ncannon could not see the farm, situated in the bottom of the valley,\nwhich was the centre of the combat. On the 18th of June, 1815, the rains\nhad still farther increased this acclivity, the mud complicated the\nproblem of the ascent, and the men not only slipped back, but stuck fast\nin the mire. Along the crest of the plateau ran a sort of trench whose\npresence it was impossible for the distant observer to divine.\n\nWhat was this trench? Let us explain. Braine-l'Alleud is a Belgian\nvillage; Ohain is another. These villages, both of them concealed in\ncurves of the landscape, are connected by a road about a league and a\nhalf in length, which traverses the plain along its undulating level,\nand often enters and buries itself in the hills like a furrow, which\nmakes a ravine of this road in some places. In 1815, as at the present\nday, this road cut the crest of the plateau of Mont-Saint-Jean between\nthe two highways from Genappe and Nivelles; only, it is now on a level\nwith the plain; it was then a hollow way. Its two slopes have been\nappropriated for the monumental hillock. This road was, and still is,\na trench throughout the greater portion of its course; a hollow trench,\nsometimes a dozen feet in depth, and whose banks, being too steep,\ncrumbled away here and there, particularly in winter, under driving\nrains. Accidents happened here. The road was so narrow at the\nBraine-l'Alleud entrance that a passer-by was crushed by a cart, as is\nproved by a stone cross which stands near the cemetery, and which gives\nthe name of the dead, Monsieur Bernard Debrye, Merchant of Brussels,\nand the date of the accident, February, 1637.[8] It was so deep on\nthe table-land of Mont-Saint-Jean that a peasant, Mathieu Nicaise,\nwas crushed there, in 1783, by a slide from the slope, as is stated on\nanother stone cross, the top of which has disappeared in the process of\nclearing the ground, but whose overturned pedestal is still visible on\nthe grassy slope to the left of the highway between La Haie-Sainte and\nthe farm of Mont-Saint-Jean.\n\nOn the day of battle, this hollow road whose existence was in no way\nindicated, bordering the crest of Mont-Saint-Jean, a trench at the\nsummit of the escarpment, a rut concealed in the soil, was invisible;\nthat is to say, terrible.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII--THE EMPEROR PUTS A QUESTION TO THE GUIDE LACOSTE\n\nSo, on the morning of Waterloo, Napoleon was content.\n\nHe was right; the plan of battle conceived by him was, as we have seen,\nreally admirable.\n\nThe battle once begun, its very various changes,--the resistance of\nHougomont; the tenacity of La Haie-Sainte; the killing of Bauduin; the\ndisabling of Foy; the unexpected wall against which Soye's brigade was\nshattered; Guilleminot's fatal heedlessness when he had neither petard\nnor powder sacks; the miring of the batteries; the fifteen unescorted\npieces overwhelmed in a hollow way by Uxbridge; the small effect of the\nbombs falling in the English lines, and there embedding themselves in\nthe rain-soaked soil, and only succeeding in producing volcanoes of mud,\nso that the canister was turned into a splash; the uselessness of Pire's\ndemonstration on Braine-l'Alleud; all that cavalry, fifteen squadrons,\nalmost exterminated; the right wing of the English badly alarmed, the\nleft wing badly cut into; Ney's strange mistake in massing, instead of\nechelonning the four divisions of the first corps; men delivered over to\ngrape-shot, arranged in ranks twenty-seven deep and with a frontage\nof two hundred; the frightful holes made in these masses by the\ncannon-balls; attacking columns disorganized; the side-battery suddenly\nunmasked on their flank; Bourgeois, Donzelot, and Durutte compromised;\nQuiot repulsed; Lieutenant Vieux, that Hercules graduated at the\nPolytechnic School, wounded at the moment when he was beating in with an\naxe the door of La Haie-Sainte under the downright fire of the English\nbarricade which barred the angle of the road from Genappe to Brussels;\nMarcognet's division caught between the infantry and the cavalry, shot\ndown at the very muzzle of the guns amid the grain by Best and Pack, put\nto the sword by Ponsonby; his battery of seven pieces spiked; the Prince\nof Saxe-Weimar holding and guarding, in spite of the Comte d'Erlon, both\nFrischemont and Smohain; the flag of the 105th taken, the flag of the\n45th captured; that black Prussian hussar stopped by runners of the\nflying column of three hundred light cavalry on the scout between Wavre\nand Plancenoit; the alarming things that had been said by prisoners;\nGrouchy's delay; fifteen hundred men killed in the orchard of Hougomont\nin less than an hour; eighteen hundred men overthrown in a still shorter\ntime about La Haie-Sainte,--all these stormy incidents passing like the\nclouds of battle before Napoleon, had hardly troubled his gaze and\nhad not overshadowed that face of imperial certainty. Napoleon was\naccustomed to gaze steadily at war; he never added up the heart-rending\ndetails, cipher by cipher; ciphers mattered little to him, provided that\nthey furnished the total, victory; he was not alarmed if the beginnings\ndid go astray, since he thought himself the master and the possessor\nat the end; he knew how to wait, supposing himself to be out of the\nquestion, and he treated destiny as his equal: he seemed to say to fate,\nThou wilt not dare.\n\nComposed half of light and half of shadow, Napoleon thought himself\nprotected in good and tolerated in evil. He had, or thought that he had,\na connivance, one might almost say a complicity, of events in his favor,\nwhich was equivalent to the invulnerability of antiquity.\n\nNevertheless, when one has Beresina, Leipzig, and Fontainebleau behind\none, it seems as though one might distrust Waterloo. A mysterious frown\nbecomes perceptible in the depths of the heavens.\n\nAt the moment when Wellington retreated, Napoleon shuddered. He suddenly\nbeheld the table-land of Mont-Saint-Jean cleared, and the van of the\nEnglish army disappear. It was rallying, but hiding itself. The Emperor\nhalf rose in his stirrups. The lightning of victory flashed from his\neyes.\n\nWellington, driven into a corner at the forest of Soignes and\ndestroyed--that was the definitive conquest of England by France; it was\nCrecy, Poitiers, Malplaquet, and Ramillies avenged. The man of Marengo\nwas wiping out Agincourt.\n\nSo the Emperor, meditating on this terrible turn of fortune, swept his\nglass for the last time over all the points of the field of battle. His\nguard, standing behind him with grounded arms, watched him from below\nwith a sort of religion. He pondered; he examined the slopes, noted the\ndeclivities, scrutinized the clumps of trees, the square of rye, the\npath; he seemed to be counting each bush. He gazed with some intentness\nat the English barricades of the two highways,--two large abatis of\ntrees, that on the road to Genappe above La Haie-Sainte, armed with two\ncannon, the only ones out of all the English artillery which commanded\nthe extremity of the field of battle, and that on the road to Nivelles\nwhere gleamed the Dutch bayonets of Chasse's brigade. Near this\nbarricade he observed the old chapel of Saint Nicholas, painted white,\nwhich stands at the angle of the cross-road near Braine-l'Alleud; he\nbent down and spoke in a low voice to the guide Lacoste. The guide made\na negative sign with his head, which was probably perfidious.\n\nThe Emperor straightened himself up and fell to thinking.\n\nWellington had drawn back.\n\nAll that remained to do was to complete this retreat by crushing him.\n\nNapoleon turning round abruptly, despatched an express at full speed to\nParis to announce that the battle was won.\n\nNapoleon was one of those geniuses from whom thunder darts.\n\nHe had just found his clap of thunder.\n\nHe gave orders to Milhaud's cuirassiers to carry the table-land of\nMont-Saint-Jean.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX--THE UNEXPECTED\n\nThere were three thousand five hundred of them. They formed a front a\nquarter of a league in extent. They were giant men, on colossal horses.\nThere were six and twenty squadrons of them; and they had behind them to\nsupport them Lefebvre-Desnouettes's division,--the one hundred and six\npicked gendarmes, the light cavalry of the Guard, eleven hundred and\nninety-seven men, and the lancers of the guard of eight hundred and\neighty lances. They wore casques without horse-tails, and cuirasses\nof beaten iron, with horse-pistols in their holsters, and long\nsabre-swords. That morning the whole army had admired them, when, at\nnine o'clock, with braying of trumpets and all the music playing \"Let us\nwatch o'er the Safety of the Empire,\" they had come in a solid column,\nwith one of their batteries on their flank, another in their centre, and\ndeployed in two ranks between the roads to Genappe and Frischemont,\nand taken up their position for battle in that powerful second line,\nso cleverly arranged by Napoleon, which, having on its extreme left\nKellermann's cuirassiers and on its extreme right Milhaud's cuirassiers,\nhad, so to speak, two wings of iron.\n\nAide-de-camp Bernard carried them the Emperor's orders. Ney drew his\nsword and placed himself at their head. The enormous squadrons were set\nin motion.\n\nThen a formidable spectacle was seen.\n\nAll their cavalry, with upraised swords, standards and trumpets flung to\nthe breeze, formed in columns by divisions, descended, by a simultaneous\nmovement and like one man, with the precision of a brazen battering-ram\nwhich is effecting a breach, the hill of La Belle Alliance, plunged into\nthe terrible depths in which so many men had already fallen, disappeared\nthere in the smoke, then emerging from that shadow, reappeared on the\nother side of the valley, still compact and in close ranks, mounting at\na full trot, through a storm of grape-shot which burst upon them,\nthe terrible muddy slope of the table-land of Mont-Saint-Jean. They\nascended, grave, threatening, imperturbable; in the intervals between\nthe musketry and the artillery, their colossal trampling was audible.\nBeing two divisions, there were two columns of them; Wathier's division\nheld the right, Delort's division was on the left. It seemed as though\ntwo immense adders of steel were to be seen crawling towards the crest\nof the table-land. It traversed the battle like a prodigy.\n\nNothing like it had been seen since the taking of the great redoubt of\nthe Muskowa by the heavy cavalry; Murat was lacking here, but Ney was\nagain present. It seemed as though that mass had become a monster and\nhad but one soul. Each column undulated and swelled like the ring of a\npolyp. They could be seen through a vast cloud of smoke which was rent\nhere and there. A confusion of helmets, of cries, of sabres, a stormy\nheaving of the cruppers of horses amid the cannons and the flourish of\ntrumpets, a terrible and disciplined tumult; over all, the cuirasses\nlike the scales on the hydra.\n\nThese narrations seemed to belong to another age. Something parallel to\nthis vision appeared, no doubt, in the ancient Orphic epics, which told\nof the centaurs, the old hippanthropes, those Titans with human\nheads and equestrian chests who scaled Olympus at a gallop, horrible,\ninvulnerable, sublime--gods and beasts.\n\nOdd numerical coincidence,--twenty-six battalions rode to meet\ntwenty-six battalions. Behind the crest of the plateau, in the shadow of\nthe masked battery, the English infantry, formed into thirteen squares,\ntwo battalions to the square, in two lines, with seven in the first\nline, six in the second, the stocks of their guns to their shoulders,\ntaking aim at that which was on the point of appearing, waited, calm,\nmute, motionless. They did not see the cuirassiers, and the cuirassiers\ndid not see them. They listened to the rise of this flood of men. They\nheard the swelling noise of three thousand horse, the alternate and\nsymmetrical tramp of their hoofs at full trot, the jingling of the\ncuirasses, the clang of the sabres and a sort of grand and savage\nbreathing. There ensued a most terrible silence; then, all at once,\na long file of uplifted arms, brandishing sabres, appeared above the\ncrest, and casques, trumpets, and standards, and three thousand heads\nwith gray mustaches, shouting, \"Vive l'Empereur!\" All this cavalry\ndebouched on the plateau, and it was like the appearance of an\nearthquake.\n\nAll at once, a tragic incident; on the English left, on our right, the\nhead of the column of cuirassiers reared up with a frightful clamor. On\narriving at the culminating point of the crest, ungovernable, utterly\ngiven over to fury and their course of extermination of the squares and\ncannon, the cuirassiers had just caught sight of a trench,--a trench\nbetween them and the English. It was the hollow road of Ohain.\n\nIt was a terrible moment. The ravine was there, unexpected, yawning,\ndirectly under the horses' feet, two fathoms deep between its double\nslopes; the second file pushed the first into it, and the third pushed\non the second; the horses reared and fell backward, landed on their\nhaunches, slid down, all four feet in the air, crushing and overwhelming\nthe riders; and there being no means of retreat,--the whole column being\nno longer anything more than a projectile,--the force which had been\nacquired to crush the English crushed the French; the inexorable ravine\ncould only yield when filled; horses and riders rolled there pell-mell,\ngrinding each other, forming but one mass of flesh in this gulf: when\nthis trench was full of living men, the rest marched over them and\npassed on. Almost a third of Dubois's brigade fell into that abyss.\n\nThis began the loss of the battle.\n\nA local tradition, which evidently exaggerates matters, says that two\nthousand horses and fifteen hundred men were buried in the hollow road\nof Ohain. This figure probably comprises all the other corpses which\nwere flung into this ravine the day after the combat.\n\nLet us note in passing that it was Dubois's sorely tried brigade which,\nan hour previously, making a charge to one side, had captured the flag\nof the Lunenburg battalion.\n\nNapoleon, before giving the order for this charge of Milhaud's\ncuirassiers, had scrutinized the ground, but had not been able to see\nthat hollow road, which did not even form a wrinkle on the surface of\nthe plateau. Warned, nevertheless, and put on the alert by the little\nwhite chapel which marks its angle of junction with the Nivelles\nhighway, he had probably put a question as to the possibility of an\nobstacle, to the guide Lacoste. The guide had answered No. We might\nalmost affirm that Napoleon's catastrophe originated in that sign of a\npeasant's head.\n\nOther fatalities were destined to arise.\n\nWas it possible that Napoleon should have won that battle? We answer No.\nWhy? Because of Wellington? Because of Blucher? No. Because of God.\n\nBonaparte victor at Waterloo; that does not come within the law of the\nnineteenth century. Another series of facts was in preparation, in which\nthere was no longer any room for Napoleon. The ill will of events had\ndeclared itself long before.\n\nIt was time that this vast man should fall.\n\nThe excessive weight of this man in human destiny disturbed the balance.\nThis individual alone counted for more than a universal group. These\nplethoras of all human vitality concentrated in a single head; the world\nmounting to the brain of one man,--this would be mortal to civilization\nwere it to last. The moment had arrived for the incorruptible and\nsupreme equity to alter its plan. Probably the principles and the\nelements, on which the regular gravitations of the moral, as of the\nmaterial, world depend, had complained. Smoking blood, over-filled\ncemeteries, mothers in tears,--these are formidable pleaders. When\nthe earth is suffering from too heavy a burden, there are mysterious\ngroanings of the shades, to which the abyss lends an ear.\n\nNapoleon had been denounced in the infinite and his fall had been\ndecided on.\n\nHe embarrassed God.\n\nWaterloo is not a battle; it is a change of front on the part of the\nUniverse.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X--THE PLATEAU OF MONT-SAINT-JEAN\n\nThe battery was unmasked at the same moment with the ravine.\n\nSixty cannons and the thirteen squares darted lightning point-blank on\nthe cuirassiers. The intrepid General Delort made the military salute to\nthe English battery.\n\nThe whole of the flying artillery of the English had re-entered the\nsquares at a gallop. The cuirassiers had not had even the time for a\nhalt. The disaster of the hollow road had decimated, but not discouraged\nthem. They belonged to that class of men who, when diminished in number,\nincrease in courage.\n\nWathier's column alone had suffered in the disaster; Delort's column,\nwhich Ney had deflected to the left, as though he had a presentiment of\nan ambush, had arrived whole.\n\nThe cuirassiers hurled themselves on the English squares.\n\nAt full speed, with bridles loose, swords in their teeth pistols in\nfist,--such was the attack.\n\nThere are moments in battles in which the soul hardens the man until\nthe soldier is changed into a statue, and when all this flesh turns into\ngranite. The English battalions, desperately assaulted, did not stir.\n\nThen it was terrible.\n\nAll the faces of the English squares were attacked at once. A frenzied\nwhirl enveloped them. That cold infantry remained impassive. The first\nrank knelt and received the cuirassiers on their bayonets, the second\nranks shot them down; behind the second rank the cannoneers charged\ntheir guns, the front of the square parted, permitted the passage of\nan eruption of grape-shot, and closed again. The cuirassiers replied\nby crushing them. Their great horses reared, strode across the ranks,\nleaped over the bayonets and fell, gigantic, in the midst of these four\nliving wells. The cannon-balls ploughed furrows in these cuirassiers;\nthe cuirassiers made breaches in the squares. Files of men disappeared,\nground to dust under the horses. The bayonets plunged into the bellies\nof these centaurs; hence a hideousness of wounds which has probably\nnever been seen anywhere else. The squares, wasted by this mad cavalry,\nclosed up their ranks without flinching. Inexhaustible in the matter of\ngrape-shot, they created explosions in their assailants' midst. The form\nof this combat was monstrous. These squares were no longer battalions,\nthey were craters; those cuirassiers were no longer cavalry, they were\na tempest. Each square was a volcano attacked by a cloud; lava contended\nwith lightning.\n\nThe square on the extreme right, the most exposed of all, being in the\nair, was almost annihilated at the very first shock. lt was formed\nof the 75th regiment of Highlanders. The bagpipe-player in the centre\ndropped his melancholy eyes, filled with the reflections of the\nforests and the lakes, in profound inattention, while men were being\nexterminated around him, and seated on a drum, with his pibroch under\nhis arm, played the Highland airs. These Scotchmen died thinking of Ben\nLothian, as did the Greeks recalling Argos. The sword of a cuirassier,\nwhich hewed down the bagpipes and the arm which bore it, put an end to\nthe song by killing the singer.\n\nThe cuirassiers, relatively few in number, and still further diminished\nby the catastrophe of the ravine, had almost the whole English army\nagainst them, but they multiplied themselves so that each man of them\nwas equal to ten. Nevertheless, some Hanoverian battalions yielded.\nWellington perceived it, and thought of his cavalry. Had Napoleon at\nthat same moment thought of his infantry, he would have won the battle.\nThis forgetfulness was his great and fatal mistake.\n\nAll at once, the cuirassiers, who had been the assailants, found\nthemselves assailed. The English cavalry was at their back. Before\nthem two squares, behind them Somerset; Somerset meant fourteen hundred\ndragoons of the guard. On the right, Somerset had Dornberg with the\nGerman light-horse, and on his left, Trip with the Belgian carabineers;\nthe cuirassiers attacked on the flank and in front, before and in the\nrear, by infantry and cavalry, had to face all sides. What mattered it\nto them? They were a whirlwind. Their valor was something indescribable.\n\nIn addition to this, they had behind them the battery, which was still\nthundering. It was necessary that it should be so, or they could never\nhave been wounded in the back. One of their cuirasses, pierced on the\nshoulder by a ball from a biscayan,[9] is in the collection of the\nWaterloo Museum.\n\nFor such Frenchmen nothing less than such Englishmen was needed. It\nwas no longer a hand-to-hand conflict; it was a shadow, a fury, a dizzy\ntransport of souls and courage, a hurricane of lightning swords. In an\ninstant the fourteen hundred dragoon guards numbered only eight hundred.\nFuller, their lieutenant-colonel, fell dead. Ney rushed up with\nthe lancers and Lefebvre-Desnouettes's light-horse. The plateau\nof Mont-Saint-Jean was captured, recaptured, captured again. The\ncuirassiers quitted the cavalry to return to the infantry; or, to put\nit more exactly, the whole of that formidable rout collared each other\nwithout releasing the other. The squares still held firm.\n\nThere were a dozen assaults. Ney had four horses killed under him. Half\nthe cuirassiers remained on the plateau. This conflict lasted two hours.\n\nThe English army was profoundly shaken. There is no doubt that, had they\nnot been enfeebled in their first shock by the disaster of the hollow\nroad the cuirassiers would have overwhelmed the centre and decided the\nvictory. This extraordinary cavalry petrified Clinton, who had seen\nTalavera and Badajoz. Wellington, three-quarters vanquished, admired\nheroically. He said in an undertone, \"Sublime!\"\n\nThe cuirassiers annihilated seven squares out of thirteen, took or\nspiked sixty pieces of ordnance, and captured from the English regiments\nsix flags, which three cuirassiers and three chasseurs of the Guard bore\nto the Emperor, in front of the farm of La Belle Alliance.\n\nWellington's situation had grown worse. This strange battle was like a\nduel between two raging, wounded men, each of whom, still fighting and\nstill resisting, is expending all his blood.\n\nWhich of the two will be the first to fall?\n\nThe conflict on the plateau continued.\n\nWhat had become of the cuirassiers? No one could have told. One thing\nis certain, that on the day after the battle, a cuirassier and his\nhorse were found dead among the woodwork of the scales for vehicles at\nMont-Saint-Jean, at the very point where the four roads from Nivelles,\nGenappe, La Hulpe, and Brussels meet and intersect each other. This\nhorseman had pierced the English lines. One of the men who picked up the\nbody still lives at Mont-Saint-Jean. His name is Dehaze. He was eighteen\nyears old at that time.\n\nWellington felt that he was yielding. The crisis was at hand.\n\nThe cuirassiers had not succeeded, since the centre was not broken\nthrough. As every one was in possession of the plateau, no one held it,\nand in fact it remained, to a great extent, with the English. Wellington\nheld the village and the culminating plain; Ney had only the crest and\nthe slope. They seemed rooted in that fatal soil on both sides.\n\nBut the weakening of the English seemed irremediable. The bleeding\nof that army was horrible. Kempt, on the left wing, demanded\nreinforcements. \"There are none,\" replied Wellington; \"he must let\nhimself be killed!\" Almost at that same moment, a singular coincidence\nwhich paints the exhaustion of the two armies, Ney demanded infantry\nfrom Napoleon, and Napoleon exclaimed, \"Infantry! Where does he expect\nme to get it? Does he think I can make it?\"\n\nNevertheless, the English army was in the worse case of the two. The\nfurious onsets of those great squadrons with cuirasses of iron and\nbreasts of steel had ground the infantry to nothing. A few men clustered\nround a flag marked the post of a regiment; such and such a battalion\nwas commanded only by a captain or a lieutenant; Alten's division,\nalready so roughly handled at La Haie-Sainte, was almost destroyed;\nthe intrepid Belgians of Van Kluze's brigade strewed the rye-fields\nall along the Nivelles road; hardly anything was left of those Dutch\ngrenadiers, who, intermingled with Spaniards in our ranks in 1811,\nfought against Wellington; and who, in 1815, rallied to the\nEnglish standard, fought against Napoleon. The loss in officers was\nconsiderable. Lord Uxbridge, who had his leg buried on the following\nday, had his knee shattered. If, on the French side, in that tussle\nof the cuirassiers, Delort, l'Heritier, Colbert, Dnop, Travers, and\nBlancard were disabled, on the side of the English there was Alten\nwounded, Barne wounded, Delancey killed, Van Meeren killed, Ompteda\nkilled, the whole of Wellington's staff decimated, and England had the\nworse of it in that bloody scale. The second regiment of foot-guards\nhad lost five lieutenant-colonels, four captains, and three ensigns;\nthe first battalion of the 30th infantry had lost 24 officers and 1,200\nsoldiers; the 79th Highlanders had lost 24 officers wounded, 18 officers\nkilled, 450 soldiers killed. The Hanoverian hussars of Cumberland, a\nwhole regiment, with Colonel Hacke at its head, who was destined to be\ntried later on and cashiered, had turned bridle in the presence of the\nfray, and had fled to the forest of Soignes, sowing defeat all the way\nto Brussels. The transports, ammunition-wagons, the baggage-wagons, the\nwagons filled with wounded, on perceiving that the French were gaining\nground and approaching the forest, rushed headlong thither. The Dutch,\nmowed down by the French cavalry, cried, \"Alarm!\" From Vert-Coucou to\nGroentendael, for a distance of nearly two leagues in the direction\nof Brussels, according to the testimony of eye-witnesses who are still\nalive, the roads were encumbered with fugitives. This panic was such\nthat it attacked the Prince de Conde at Mechlin, and Louis XVIII. at\nGhent. With the exception of the feeble reserve echelonned behind the\nambulance established at the farm of Mont-Saint-Jean, and of Vivian's\nand Vandeleur's brigades, which flanked the left wing, Wellington had\nno cavalry left. A number of batteries lay unhorsed. These facts are\nattested by Siborne; and Pringle, exaggerating the disaster, goes so far\nas to say that the Anglo-Dutch army was reduced to thirty-four thousand\nmen. The Iron Duke remained calm, but his lips blanched. Vincent, the\nAustrian commissioner, Alava, the Spanish commissioner, who were present\nat the battle in the English staff, thought the Duke lost. At five\no'clock Wellington drew out his watch, and he was heard to murmur these\nsinister words, \"Blucher, or night!\"\n\nIt was at about that moment that a distant line of bayonets gleamed on\nthe heights in the direction of Frischemont.\n\nHere comes the change of face in this giant drama.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI--A BAD GUIDE TO NAPOLEON; A GOOD GUIDE TO BULOW\n\nThe painful surprise of Napoleon is well known. Grouchy hoped for,\nBlucher arriving. Death instead of life.\n\nFate has these turns; the throne of the world was expected; it was Saint\nHelena that was seen.\n\nIf the little shepherd who served as guide to Bulow, Blucher's\nlieutenant, had advised him to debouch from the forest above\nFrischemont, instead of below Plancenoit, the form of the nineteenth\ncentury might, perhaps, have been different. Napoleon would have won the\nbattle of Waterloo. By any other route than that below Plancenoit,\nthe Prussian army would have come out upon a ravine impassable for\nartillery, and Bulow would not have arrived.\n\nNow the Prussian general, Muffling, declares that one hour's delay, and\nBlucher would not have found Wellington on his feet. \"The battle was\nlost.\"\n\nIt was time that Bulow should arrive, as will be seen. He had, moreover,\nbeen very much delayed. He had bivouacked at Dion-le-Mont, and had set\nout at daybreak; but the roads were impassable, and his divisions stuck\nfast in the mire. The ruts were up to the hubs of the cannons. Moreover,\nhe had been obliged to pass the Dyle on the narrow bridge of Wavre;\nthe street leading to the bridge had been fired by the French, so\nthe caissons and ammunition-wagons could not pass between two rows of\nburning houses, and had been obliged to wait until the conflagration was\nextinguished. It was mid-day before Bulow's vanguard had been able to\nreach Chapelle-Saint-Lambert.\n\nHad the action been begun two hours earlier, it would have been over\nat four o'clock, and Blucher would have fallen on the battle won by\nNapoleon. Such are these immense risks proportioned to an infinite which\nwe cannot comprehend.\n\nThe Emperor had been the first, as early as mid-day, to descry with his\nfield-glass, on the extreme horizon, something which had attracted his\nattention. He had said, \"I see yonder a cloud, which seems to me to be\ntroops.\" Then he asked the Duc de Dalmatie, \"Soult, what do you see in\nthe direction of Chapelle-Saint-Lambert?\" The marshal, levelling his\nglass, answered, \"Four or five thousand men, Sire; evidently Grouchy.\"\nBut it remained motionless in the mist. All the glasses of the staff\nhad studied \"the cloud\" pointed out by the Emperor. Some said: \"It is\ntrees.\" The truth is, that the cloud did not move. The Emperor detached\nDomon's division of light cavalry to reconnoitre in that quarter.\n\nBulow had not moved, in fact. His vanguard was very feeble, and could\naccomplish nothing. He was obliged to wait for the body of the army\ncorps, and he had received orders to concentrate his forces before\nentering into line; but at five o'clock, perceiving Wellington's peril,\nBlucher ordered Bulow to attack, and uttered these remarkable words: \"We\nmust give air to the English army.\"\n\nA little later, the divisions of Losthin, Hiller, Hacke, and Ryssel\ndeployed before Lobau's corps, the cavalry of Prince William of Prussia\ndebouched from the forest of Paris, Plancenoit was in flames, and the\nPrussian cannon-balls began to rain even upon the ranks of the guard in\nreserve behind Napoleon.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII--THE GUARD\n\nEvery one knows the rest,--the irruption of a third army; the battle\nbroken to pieces; eighty-six mouths of fire thundering simultaneously;\nPirch the first coming up with Bulow; Zieten's cavalry led by Blucher\nin person, the French driven back; Marcognet swept from the plateau of\nOhain; Durutte dislodged from Papelotte; Donzelot and Quiot retreating;\nLobau caught on the flank; a fresh battle precipitating itself on our\ndismantled regiments at nightfall; the whole English line resuming the\noffensive and thrust forward; the gigantic breach made in the French\narmy; the English grape-shot and the Prussian grape-shot aiding each\nother; the extermination; disaster in front; disaster on the flank; the\nGuard entering the line in the midst of this terrible crumbling of all\nthings.\n\nConscious that they were about to die, they shouted, \"Vive l'Empereur!\"\nHistory records nothing more touching than that agony bursting forth in\nacclamations.\n\nThe sky had been overcast all day long. All of a sudden, at that very\nmoment,--it was eight o'clock in the evening--the clouds on the horizon\nparted, and allowed the grand and sinister glow of the setting sun to\npass through, athwart the elms on the Nivelles road. They had seen it\nrise at Austerlitz.\n\nEach battalion of the Guard was commanded by a general for this final\ncatastrophe. Friant, Michel, Roguet, Harlet, Mallet, Poret de Morvan,\nwere there. When the tall caps of the grenadiers of the Guard, with\ntheir large plaques bearing the eagle appeared, symmetrical, in line,\ntranquil, in the midst of that combat, the enemy felt a respect for\nFrance; they thought they beheld twenty victories entering the field\nof battle, with wings outspread, and those who were the conquerors,\nbelieving themselves to be vanquished, retreated; but Wellington\nshouted, \"Up, Guards, and aim straight!\" The red regiment of English\nguards, lying flat behind the hedges, sprang up, a cloud of grape-shot\nriddled the tricolored flag and whistled round our eagles; all hurled\nthemselves forwards, and the final carnage began. In the darkness, the\nImperial Guard felt the army losing ground around it, and in the vast\nshock of the rout it heard the desperate flight which had taken the\nplace of the \"Vive l'Empereur!\" and, with flight behind it, it continued\nto advance, more crushed, losing more men at every step that it took.\nThere were none who hesitated, no timid men in its ranks. The soldier in\nthat troop was as much of a hero as the general. Not a man was missing\nin that suicide.\n\nNey, bewildered, great with all the grandeur of accepted death, offered\nhimself to all blows in that tempest. He had his fifth horse killed\nunder him there. Perspiring, his eyes aflame, foaming at the mouth, with\nuniform unbuttoned, one of his epaulets half cut off by a sword-stroke\nfrom a horseguard, his plaque with the great eagle dented by a bullet;\nbleeding, bemired, magnificent, a broken sword in his hand, he said,\n\"Come and see how a Marshal of France dies on the field of battle!\" But\nin vain; he did not die. He was haggard and angry. At Drouet d'Erlon he\nhurled this question, \"Are you not going to get yourself killed?\" In\nthe midst of all that artillery engaged in crushing a handful of men,\nhe shouted: \"So there is nothing for me! Oh! I should like to have all\nthese English bullets enter my bowels!\" Unhappy man, thou wert reserved\nfor French bullets!\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII--THE CATASTROPHE\n\nThe rout behind the Guard was melancholy.\n\nThe army yielded suddenly on all sides at once,--Hougomont, La\nHaie-Sainte, Papelotte, Plancenoit. The cry \"Treachery!\" was followed by\na cry of \"Save yourselves who can!\" An army which is disbanding is\nlike a thaw. All yields, splits, cracks, floats, rolls, falls, jostles,\nhastens, is precipitated. The disintegration is unprecedented. Ney\nborrows a horse, leaps upon it, and without hat, cravat, or sword,\nplaces himself across the Brussels road, stopping both English and\nFrench. He strives to detain the army, he recalls it to its duty, he\ninsults it, he clings to the rout. He is overwhelmed. The soldiers fly\nfrom him, shouting, \"Long live Marshal Ney!\" Two of Durutte's regiments\ngo and come in affright as though tossed back and forth between the\nswords of the Uhlans and the fusillade of the brigades of Kempt, Best,\nPack, and Rylandt; the worst of hand-to-hand conflicts is the defeat;\nfriends kill each other in order to escape; squadrons and battalions\nbreak and disperse against each other, like the tremendous foam of\nbattle. Lobau at one extremity, and Reille at the other, are drawn into\nthe tide. In vain does Napoleon erect walls from what is left to him of\nhis Guard; in vain does he expend in a last effort his last serviceable\nsquadrons. Quiot retreats before Vivian, Kellermann before Vandeleur,\nLobau before Bulow, Morand before Pirch, Domon and Subervic before\nPrince William of Prussia; Guyot, who led the Emperor's squadrons to the\ncharge, falls beneath the feet of the English dragoons. Napoleon gallops\npast the line of fugitives, harangues, urges, threatens, entreats\nthem. All the mouths which in the morning had shouted, \"Long live\nthe Emperor!\" remain gaping; they hardly recognize him. The Prussian\ncavalry, newly arrived, dashes forwards, flies, hews, slashes, kills,\nexterminates. Horses lash out, the cannons flee; the soldiers of the\nartillery-train unharness the caissons and use the horses to make their\nescape; transports overturned, with all four wheels in the air, clog the\nroad and occasion massacres. Men are crushed, trampled down, others walk\nover the dead and the living. Arms are lost. A dizzy multitude fills the\nroads, the paths, the bridges, the plains, the hills, the valleys,\nthe woods, encumbered by this invasion of forty thousand men. Shouts\ndespair, knapsacks and guns flung among the rye, passages forced at\nthe point of the sword, no more comrades, no more officers, no more\ngenerals, an inexpressible terror. Zieten putting France to the sword at\nits leisure. Lions converted into goats. Such was the flight.\n\nAt Genappe, an effort was made to wheel about, to present a battle\nfront, to draw up in line. Lobau rallied three hundred men. The entrance\nto the village was barricaded, but at the first volley of Prussian\ncanister, all took to flight again, and Lobau was taken. That volley of\ngrape-shot can be seen to-day imprinted on the ancient gable of a brick\nbuilding on the right of the road at a few minutes' distance before you\nenter Genappe. The Prussians threw themselves into Genappe, furious, no\ndoubt, that they were not more entirely the conquerors. The pursuit was\nstupendous. Blucher ordered extermination. Roguet had set the lugubrious\nexample of threatening with death any French grenadier who should bring\nhim a Prussian prisoner. Blucher outdid Roguet. Duhesme, the general\nof the Young Guard, hemmed in at the doorway of an inn at Genappe,\nsurrendered his sword to a huzzar of death, who took the sword and slew\nthe prisoner. The victory was completed by the assassination of the\nvanquished. Let us inflict punishment, since we are history: old\nBlucher disgraced himself. This ferocity put the finishing touch to the\ndisaster. The desperate route traversed Genappe, traversed Quatre-Bras,\ntraversed Gosselies, traversed Frasnes, traversed Charleroi, traversed\nThuin, and only halted at the frontier. Alas! and who, then, was fleeing\nin that manner? The Grand Army.\n\nThis vertigo, this terror, this downfall into ruin of the loftiest\nbravery which ever astounded history,--is that causeless? No. The shadow\nof an enormous right is projected athwart Waterloo. It is the day of\ndestiny. The force which is mightier than man produced that day. Hence\nthe terrified wrinkle of those brows; hence all those great souls\nsurrendering their swords. Those who had conquered Europe have fallen\nprone on the earth, with nothing left to say nor to do, feeling the\npresent shadow of a terrible presence. Hoc erat in fatis. That day the\nperspective of the human race underwent a change. Waterloo is the\nhinge of the nineteenth century. The disappearance of the great man was\nnecessary to the advent of the great century. Some one, a person to whom\none replies not, took the responsibility on himself. The panic of heroes\ncan be explained. In the battle of Waterloo there is something more than\na cloud, there is something of the meteor. God has passed by.\n\nAt nightfall, in a meadow near Genappe, Bernard and Bertrand seized by\nthe skirt of his coat and detained a man, haggard, pensive, sinister,\ngloomy, who, dragged to that point by the current of the rout, had just\ndismounted, had passed the bridle of his horse over his arm, and with\nwild eye was returning alone to Waterloo. It was Napoleon, the immense\nsomnambulist of this dream which had crumbled, essaying once more to\nadvance.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV--THE LAST SQUARE\n\nSeveral squares of the Guard, motionless amid this stream of the defeat,\nas rocks in running water, held their own until night. Night came,\ndeath also; they awaited that double shadow, and, invincible, allowed\nthemselves to be enveloped therein. Each regiment, isolated from the\nrest, and having no bond with the army, now shattered in every part,\ndied alone. They had taken up position for this final action, some on\nthe heights of Rossomme, others on the plain of Mont-Saint-Jean. There,\nabandoned, vanquished, terrible, those gloomy squares endured their\ndeath-throes in formidable fashion. Ulm, Wagram, Jena, Friedland, died\nwith them.\n\nAt twilight, towards nine o'clock in the evening, one of them was left\nat the foot of the plateau of Mont-Saint-Jean. In that fatal valley,\nat the foot of that declivity which the cuirassiers had ascended, now\ninundated by the masses of the English, under the converging fires\nof the victorious hostile cavalry, under a frightful density of\nprojectiles, this square fought on. It was commanded by an obscure\nofficer named Cambronne. At each discharge, the square diminished and\nreplied. It replied to the grape-shot with a fusillade, continually\ncontracting its four walls. The fugitives pausing breathless for a\nmoment in the distance, listened in the darkness to that gloomy and\never-decreasing thunder.\n\nWhen this legion had been reduced to a handful, when nothing was left\nof their flag but a rag, when their guns, the bullets all gone, were no\nlonger anything but clubs, when the heap of corpses was larger than the\ngroup of survivors, there reigned among the conquerors, around those men\ndying so sublimely, a sort of sacred terror, and the English artillery,\ntaking breath, became silent. This furnished a sort of respite. These\ncombatants had around them something in the nature of a swarm of\nspectres, silhouettes of men on horseback, the black profiles of cannon,\nthe white sky viewed through wheels and gun-carriages, the colossal\ndeath's-head, which the heroes saw constantly through the smoke, in the\ndepths of the battle, advanced upon them and gazed at them. Through the\nshades of twilight they could hear the pieces being loaded; the matches\nall lighted, like the eyes of tigers at night, formed a circle round\ntheir heads; all the lintstocks of the English batteries approached the\ncannons, and then, with emotion, holding the supreme moment suspended\nabove these men, an English general, Colville according to some,\nMaitland according to others, shouted to them, \"Surrender, brave\nFrenchmen!\" Cambronne replied, \"-----.\"\n\n{EDITOR'S COMMENTARY: Another edition of this book has the word \"Merde!\"\nin lieu of the ----- above.}\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XV--CAMBRONNE\n\nIf any French reader object to having his susceptibilities offended, one\nwould have to refrain from repeating in his presence what is perhaps\nthe finest reply that a Frenchman ever made. This would enjoin us from\nconsigning something sublime to History.\n\nAt our own risk and peril, let us violate this injunction.\n\nNow, then, among those giants there was one Titan,--Cambronne.\n\nTo make that reply and then perish, what could be grander? For being\nwilling to die is the same as to die; and it was not this man's fault if\nhe survived after he was shot.\n\nThe winner of the battle of Waterloo was not Napoleon, who was put to\nflight; nor Wellington, giving way at four o'clock, in despair at five;\nnor Blucher, who took no part in the engagement. The winner of Waterloo\nwas Cambronne.\n\nTo thunder forth such a reply at the lightning-flash that kills you is\nto conquer!\n\nThus to answer the Catastrophe, thus to speak to Fate, to give this\npedestal to the future lion, to hurl such a challenge to the midnight\nrainstorm, to the treacherous wall of Hougomont, to the sunken road of\nOhain, to Grouchy's delay, to Blucher's arrival, to be Irony itself in\nthe tomb, to act so as to stand upright though fallen, to drown in\ntwo syllables the European coalition, to offer kings privies which\nthe Caesars once knew, to make the lowest of words the most lofty by\nentwining with it the glory of France, insolently to end Waterloo with\nMardigras, to finish Leonidas with Rabellais, to set the crown on this\nvictory by a word impossible to speak, to lose the field and preserve\nhistory, to have the laugh on your side after such a carnage,--this is\nimmense!\n\nIt was an insult such as a thunder-cloud might hurl! It reaches the\ngrandeur of AEschylus!\n\nCambronne's reply produces the effect of a violent break. 'Tis like the\nbreaking of a heart under a weight of scorn. 'Tis the overflow of agony\nbursting forth. Who conquered? Wellington? No! Had it not been for\nBlucher, he was lost. Was it Blucher? No! If Wellington had not begun,\nBlucher could not have finished. This Cambronne, this man spending his\nlast hour, this unknown soldier, this infinitesimal of war, realizes\nthat here is a falsehood, a falsehood in a catastrophe, and so doubly\nagonizing; and at the moment when his rage is bursting forth because of\nit, he is offered this mockery,--life! How could he restrain himself?\nYonder are all the kings of Europe, the general's flushed with victory,\nthe Jupiter's darting thunderbolts; they have a hundred thousand\nvictorious soldiers, and back of the hundred thousand a million; their\ncannon stand with yawning mouths, the match is lighted; they grind down\nunder their heels the Imperial guards, and the grand army; they have\njust crushed Napoleon, and only Cambronne remains,--only this earthworm\nis left to protest. He will protest. Then he seeks for the appropriate\nword as one seeks for a sword. His mouth froths, and the froth is the\nword. In face of this mean and mighty victory, in face of this victory\nwhich counts none victorious, this desperate soldier stands erect. He\ngrants its overwhelming immensity, but he establishes its triviality;\nand he does more than spit upon it. Borne down by numbers, by superior\nforce, by brute matter, he finds in his soul an expression: \"Excrement!\"\nWe repeat it,--to use that word, to do thus, to invent such an\nexpression, is to be the conqueror!\n\nThe spirit of mighty days at that portentous moment made its descent\non that unknown man. Cambronne invents the word for Waterloo as Rouget\ninvents the \"Marseillaise,\" under the visitation of a breath from on\nhigh. An emanation from the divine whirlwind leaps forth and comes\nsweeping over these men, and they shake, and one of them sings the song\nsupreme, and the other utters the frightful cry.\n\nThis challenge of titanic scorn Cambronne hurls not only at Europe in\nthe name of the Empire,--that would be a trifle: he hurls it at the past\nin the name of the Revolution. It is heard, and Cambronne is recognized\nas possessed by the ancient spirit of the Titans. Danton seems to be\nspeaking! Kleber seems to be bellowing!\n\nAt that word from Cambronne, the English voice responded, \"Fire!\"\nThe batteries flamed, the hill trembled, from all those brazen mouths\nbelched a last terrible gush of grape-shot; a vast volume of smoke,\nvaguely white in the light of the rising moon, rolled out, and when the\nsmoke dispersed, there was no longer anything there. That formidable\nremnant had been annihilated; the Guard was dead. The four walls of the\nliving redoubt lay prone, and hardly was there discernible, here and\nthere, even a quiver in the bodies; it was thus that the French legions,\ngreater than the Roman legions, expired on Mont-Saint-Jean, on the soil\nwatered with rain and blood, amid the gloomy grain, on the spot where\nnowadays Joseph, who drives the post-wagon from Nivelles, passes\nwhistling, and cheerfully whipping up his horse at four o'clock in the\nmorning.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI--QUOT LIBRAS IN DUCE?\n\nThe battle of Waterloo is an enigma. It is as obscure to those who won\nit as to those who lost it. For Napoleon it was a panic;[10] Blucher\nsees nothing in it but fire; Wellington understands nothing in regard\nto it. Look at the reports. The bulletins are confused, the commentaries\ninvolved. Some stammer, others lisp. Jomini divides the battle of\nWaterloo into four moments; Muffling cuts it up into three changes;\nCharras alone, though we hold another judgment than his on some points,\nseized with his haughty glance the characteristic outlines of that\ncatastrophe of human genius in conflict with divine chance. All the\nother historians suffer from being somewhat dazzled, and in this dazzled\nstate they fumble about. It was a day of lightning brilliancy; in fact,\na crumbling of the military monarchy which, to the vast stupefaction of\nkings, drew all the kingdoms after it--the fall of force, the defeat of\nwar.\n\nIn this event, stamped with superhuman necessity, the part played by men\namounts to nothing.\n\nIf we take Waterloo from Wellington and Blucher, do we thereby deprive\nEngland and Germany of anything? No. Neither that illustrious England\nnor that august Germany enter into the problem of Waterloo. Thank\nHeaven, nations are great, independently of the lugubrious feats of\nthe sword. Neither England, nor Germany, nor France is contained in\na scabbard. At this epoch when Waterloo is only a clashing of swords,\nabove Blucher, Germany has Schiller; above Wellington, England has\nByron. A vast dawn of ideas is the peculiarity of our century, and in\nthat aurora England and Germany have a magnificent radiance. They\nare majestic because they think. The elevation of level which they\ncontribute to civilization is intrinsic with them; it proceeds from\nthemselves and not from an accident. The aggrandizement which they have\nbrought to the nineteenth century has not Waterloo as its source. It is\nonly barbarous peoples who undergo rapid growth after a victory. That is\nthe temporary vanity of torrents swelled by a storm. Civilized people,\nespecially in our day, are neither elevated nor abased by the good or\nbad fortune of a captain. Their specific gravity in the human species\nresults from something more than a combat. Their honor, thank God! their\ndignity, their intelligence, their genius, are not numbers which those\ngamblers, heroes and conquerors, can put in the lottery of battles.\nOften a battle is lost and progress is conquered. There is less glory\nand more liberty. The drum holds its peace; reason takes the word. It is\na game in which he who loses wins. Let us, therefore, speak of Waterloo\ncoldly from both sides. Let us render to chance that which is due\nto chance, and to God that which is due to God. What is Waterloo? A\nvictory? No. The winning number in the lottery.\n\nThe quine [11] won by Europe, paid by France.\n\nIt was not worth while to place a lion there.\n\nWaterloo, moreover, is the strangest encounter in history. Napoleon and\nWellington. They are not enemies; they are opposites. Never did God,\nwho is fond of antitheses, make a more striking contrast, a more\nextraordinary comparison. On one side, precision, foresight, geometry,\nprudence, an assured retreat, reserves spared, with an obstinate\ncoolness, an imperturbable method, strategy, which takes advantage\nof the ground, tactics, which preserve the equilibrium of battalions,\ncarnage, executed according to rule, war regulated, watch in hand,\nnothing voluntarily left to chance, the ancient classic courage,\nabsolute regularity; on the other, intuition, divination, military\noddity, superhuman instinct, a flaming glance, an indescribable\nsomething which gazes like an eagle, and which strikes like the\nlightning, a prodigious art in disdainful impetuosity, all the mysteries\nof a profound soul, associated with destiny; the stream, the plain, the\nforest, the hill, summoned, and in a manner, forced to obey, the despot\ngoing even so far as to tyrannize over the field of battle; faith in\na star mingled with strategic science, elevating but perturbing it.\nWellington was the Bareme of war; Napoleon was its Michael Angelo; and\non this occasion, genius was vanquished by calculation. On both sides\nsome one was awaited. It was the exact calculator who succeeded.\nNapoleon was waiting for Grouchy; he did not come. Wellington expected\nBlucher; he came.\n\nWellington is classic war taking its revenge. Bonaparte, at his dawning,\nhad encountered him in Italy, and beaten him superbly. The old owl had\nfled before the young vulture. The old tactics had been not only struck\nas by lightning, but disgraced. Who was that Corsican of six and twenty?\nWhat signified that splendid ignoramus, who, with everything against\nhim, nothing in his favor, without provisions, without ammunition,\nwithout cannon, without shoes, almost without an army, with a mere\nhandful of men against masses, hurled himself on Europe combined,\nand absurdly won victories in the impossible? Whence had issued that\nfulminating convict, who almost without taking breath, and with the same\nset of combatants in hand, pulverized, one after the other, the five\narmies of the emperor of Germany, upsetting Beaulieu on Alvinzi, Wurmser\non Beaulieu, Melas on Wurmser, Mack on Melas? Who was this novice in\nwar with the effrontery of a luminary? The academical military school\nexcommunicated him, and as it lost its footing; hence, the implacable\nrancor of the old Caesarism against the new; of the regular sword\nagainst the flaming sword; and of the exchequer against genius. On the\n18th of June, 1815, that rancor had the last word. and beneath Lodi,\nMontebello, Montenotte, Mantua, Arcola, it wrote: Waterloo. A triumph of\nthe mediocres which is sweet to the majority. Destiny consented to this\nirony. In his decline, Napoleon found Wurmser, the younger, again in\nfront of him.\n\nIn fact, to get Wurmser, it sufficed to blanch the hair of Wellington.\n\nWaterloo is a battle of the first order, won by a captain of the second.\n\nThat which must be admired in the battle of Waterloo, is England; the\nEnglish firmness, the English resolution, the English blood; the superb\nthing about England there, no offence to her, was herself. It was not\nher captain; it was her army.\n\nWellington, oddly ungrateful, declares in a letter to Lord Bathurst,\nthat his army, the army which fought on the 18th of June, 1815, was a\n\"detestable army.\" What does that sombre intermingling of bones buried\nbeneath the furrows of Waterloo think of that?\n\nEngland has been too modest in the matter of Wellington. To make\nWellington so great is to belittle England. Wellington is nothing but\na hero like many another. Those Scotch Grays, those Horse Guards, those\nregiments of Maitland and of Mitchell, that infantry of Pack and Kempt,\nthat cavalry of Ponsonby and Somerset, those Highlanders playing the\npibroch under the shower of grape-shot, those battalions of Rylandt,\nthose utterly raw recruits, who hardly knew how to handle a musket\nholding their own against Essling's and Rivoli's old troops,--that is\nwhat was grand. Wellington was tenacious; in that lay his merit, and we\nare not seeking to lessen it: but the least of his foot-soldiers and of\nhis cavalry would have been as solid as he. The iron soldier is worth\nas much as the Iron Duke. As for us, all our glorification goes to the\nEnglish soldier, to the English army, to the English people. If trophy\nthere be, it is to England that the trophy is due. The column of\nWaterloo would be more just, if, instead of the figure of a man, it bore\non high the statue of a people.\n\nBut this great England will be angry at what we are saying here. She\nstill cherishes, after her own 1688 and our 1789, the feudal illusion.\nShe believes in heredity and hierarchy. This people, surpassed by none\nin power and glory, regards itself as a nation, and not as a people. And\nas a people, it willingly subordinates itself and takes a lord for its\nhead. As a workman, it allows itself to be disdained; as a soldier, it\nallows itself to be flogged.\n\nIt will be remembered, that at the battle of Inkermann a sergeant who\nhad, it appears, saved the army, could not be mentioned by Lord Paglan,\nas the English military hierarchy does not permit any hero below the\ngrade of an officer to be mentioned in the reports.\n\nThat which we admire above all, in an encounter of the nature of\nWaterloo, is the marvellous cleverness of chance. A nocturnal rain, the\nwall of Hougomont, the hollow road of Ohain, Grouchy deaf to the cannon,\nNapoleon's guide deceiving him, Bulow's guide enlightening him,--the\nwhole of this cataclysm is wonderfully conducted.\n\nOn the whole, let us say it plainly, it was more of a massacre than of a\nbattle at Waterloo.\n\nOf all pitched battles, Waterloo is the one which has the smallest front\nfor such a number of combatants. Napoleon three-quarters of a league;\nWellington, half a league; seventy-two thousand combatants on each side.\nFrom this denseness the carnage arose.\n\nThe following calculation has been made, and the following proportion\nestablished: Loss of men: at Austerlitz, French, fourteen per cent;\nRussians, thirty per cent; Austrians, forty-four per cent. At Wagram,\nFrench, thirteen per cent; Austrians, fourteen. At the Moskowa, French,\nthirty-seven per cent; Russians, forty-four. At Bautzen, French,\nthirteen per cent; Russians and Prussians, fourteen. At Waterloo,\nFrench, fifty-six per cent; the Allies, thirty-one. Total for Waterloo,\nforty-one per cent; one hundred and forty-four thousand combatants;\nsixty thousand dead.\n\nTo-day the field of Waterloo has the calm which belongs to the earth,\nthe impassive support of man, and it resembles all plains.\n\nAt night, moreover, a sort of visionary mist arises from it; and if a\ntraveller strolls there, if he listens, if he watches, if he dreams\nlike Virgil in the fatal plains of Philippi, the hallucination of the\ncatastrophe takes possession of him. The frightful 18th of June lives\nagain; the false monumental hillock disappears, the lion vanishes in\nair, the battle-field resumes its reality, lines of infantry undulate\nover the plain, furious gallops traverse the horizon; the frightened\ndreamer beholds the flash of sabres, the gleam of bayonets, the flare of\nbombs, the tremendous interchange of thunders; he hears, as it were,\nthe death rattle in the depths of a tomb, the vague clamor of the battle\nphantom; those shadows are grenadiers, those lights are cuirassiers;\nthat skeleton Napoleon, that other skeleton is Wellington; all this no\nlonger exists, and yet it clashes together and combats still; and the\nravines are empurpled, and the trees quiver, and there is fury even in\nthe clouds and in the shadows; all those terrible heights, Hougomont,\nMont-Saint-Jean, Frischemont, Papelotte, Plancenoit, appear confusedly\ncrowned with whirlwinds of spectres engaged in exterminating each other.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVII--IS WATERLOO TO BE CONSIDERED GOOD?\n\nThere exists a very respectable liberal school which does not hate\nWaterloo. We do not belong to it. To us, Waterloo is but the stupefied\ndate of liberty. That such an eagle should emerge from such an egg is\ncertainly unexpected.\n\nIf one places one's self at the culminating point of view of the\nquestion, Waterloo is intentionally a counter-revolutionary victory. It\nis Europe against France; it is Petersburg, Berlin, and Vienna against\nParis; it is the statu quo against the initiative; it is the 14th\nof July, 1789, attacked through the 20th of March, 1815; it is the\nmonarchies clearing the decks in opposition to the indomitable French\nrioting. The final extinction of that vast people which had been in\neruption for twenty-six years--such was the dream. The solidarity of the\nBrunswicks, the Nassaus, the Romanoffs, the Hohenzollerns, the Hapsburgs\nwith the Bourbons. Waterloo bears divine right on its crupper. It is\ntrue, that the Empire having been despotic, the kingdom by the natural\nreaction of things, was forced to be liberal, and that a constitutional\norder was the unwilling result of Waterloo, to the great regret of the\nconquerors. It is because revolution cannot be really conquered, and\nthat being providential and absolutely fatal, it is always cropping\nup afresh: before Waterloo, in Bonaparte overthrowing the old thrones;\nafter Waterloo, in Louis XVIII. granting and conforming to the charter.\nBonaparte places a postilion on the throne of Naples, and a sergeant\non the throne of Sweden, employing inequality to demonstrate equality;\nLouis XVIII. at Saint-Ouen countersigns the declaration of the rights\nof man. If you wish to gain an idea of what revolution is, call it\nProgress; and if you wish to acquire an idea of the nature of progress,\ncall it To-morrow. To-morrow fulfils its work irresistibly, and it is\nalready fulfilling it to-day. It always reaches its goal strangely. It\nemploys Wellington to make of Foy, who was only a soldier, an orator.\nFoy falls at Hougomont and rises again in the tribune. Thus does\nprogress proceed. There is no such thing as a bad tool for that workman.\nIt does not become disconcerted, but adjusts to its divine work the\nman who has bestridden the Alps, and the good old tottering invalid\nof Father Elysee. It makes use of the gouty man as well as of the\nconqueror; of the conqueror without, of the gouty man within. Waterloo,\nby cutting short the demolition of European thrones by the sword, had\nno other effect than to cause the revolutionary work to be continued in\nanother direction. The slashers have finished; it was the turn of the\nthinkers. The century that Waterloo was intended to arrest has pursued\nits march. That sinister victory was vanquished by liberty.\n\nIn short, and incontestably, that which triumphed at Waterloo; that\nwhich smiled in Wellington's rear; that which brought him all the\nmarshals' staffs of Europe, including, it is said, the staff of a\nmarshal of France; that which joyously trundled the barrows full of\nbones to erect the knoll of the lion; that which triumphantly inscribed\non that pedestal the date \"June 18, 1815\"; that which encouraged\nBlucher, as he put the flying army to the sword; that which, from the\nheights of the plateau of Mont-Saint-Jean, hovered over France as over\nits prey, was the counter-revolution. It was the counter-revolution\nwhich murmured that infamous word \"dismemberment.\" On arriving in Paris,\nit beheld the crater close at hand; it felt those ashes which scorched\nits feet, and it changed its mind; it returned to the stammer of a\ncharter.\n\nLet us behold in Waterloo only that which is in Waterloo. Of intentional\nliberty there is none. The counter-revolution was involuntarily liberal,\nin the same manner as, by a corresponding phenomenon, Napoleon was\ninvoluntarily revolutionary. On the 18th of June, 1815, the mounted\nRobespierre was hurled from his saddle.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVIII--A RECRUDESCENCE OF DIVINE RIGHT\n\nEnd of the dictatorship. A whole European system crumbled away.\n\nThe Empire sank into a gloom which resembled that of the Roman world as\nit expired. Again we behold the abyss, as in the days of the barbarians;\nonly the barbarism of 1815, which must be called by its pet name of the\ncounter-revolution, was not long breathed, soon fell to panting, and\nhalted short. The Empire was bewept,--let us acknowledge the fact,--and\nbewept by heroic eyes. If glory lies in the sword converted into a\nsceptre, the Empire had been glory in person. It had diffused over the\nearth all the light which tyranny can give a sombre light. We will say\nmore; an obscure light. Compared to the true daylight, it is night. This\ndisappearance of night produces the effect of an eclipse.\n\nLouis XVIII. re-entered Paris. The circling dances of the 8th of July\neffaced the enthusiasms of the 20th of March. The Corsican became the\nantithesis of the Bearnese. The flag on the dome of the Tuileries was\nwhite. The exile reigned. Hartwell's pine table took its place in front\nof the fleur-de-lys-strewn throne of Louis XIV. Bouvines and Fontenoy\nwere mentioned as though they had taken place on the preceding\nday, Austerlitz having become antiquated. The altar and the throne\nfraternized majestically. One of the most undisputed forms of the health\nof society in the nineteenth century was established over France, and\nover the continent. Europe adopted the white cockade. Trestaillon was\ncelebrated. The device non pluribus impar re-appeared on the stone rays\nrepresenting a sun upon the front of the barracks on the Quai d'Orsay.\nWhere there had been an Imperial Guard, there was now a red house. The\nArc du Carrousel, all laden with badly borne victories, thrown out\nof its element among these novelties, a little ashamed, it may be, of\nMarengo and Arcola, extricated itself from its predicament with the\nstatue of the Duc d'Angouleme. The cemetery of the Madeleine, a terrible\npauper's grave in 1793, was covered with jasper and marble, since the\nbones of Louis XVI. and Marie Antoinette lay in that dust.\n\nIn the moat of Vincennes a sepulchral shaft sprang from the earth,\nrecalling the fact that the Duc d'Enghien had perished in the very\nmonth when Napoleon was crowned. Pope Pius VII., who had performed the\ncoronation very near this death, tranquilly bestowed his blessing on the\nfall as he had bestowed it on the elevation. At Schoenbrunn there was\na little shadow, aged four, whom it was seditious to call the King of\nRome. And these things took place, and the kings resumed their thrones,\nand the master of Europe was put in a cage, and the old regime became\nthe new regime, and all the shadows and all the light of the earth\nchanged place, because, on the afternoon of a certain summer's day, a\nshepherd said to a Prussian in the forest, \"Go this way, and not that!\"\n\nThis 1815 was a sort of lugubrious April. Ancient unhealthy and\npoisonous realities were covered with new appearances. A lie wedded\n1789; the right divine was masked under a charter; fictions became\nconstitutional; prejudices, superstitions and mental reservations, with\nArticle 14 in the heart, were varnished over with liberalism. It was the\nserpent's change of skin.\n\nMan had been rendered both greater and smaller by Napoleon. Under this\nreign of splendid matter, the ideal had received the strange name of\nideology! It is a grave imprudence in a great man to turn the future\ninto derision. The populace, however, that food for cannon which is so\nfond of the cannoneer, sought him with its glance. Where is he? What is\nhe doing? \"Napoleon is dead,\" said a passer-by to a veteran of Marengo\nand Waterloo. \"He dead!\" cried the soldier; \"you don't know him.\"\nImagination distrusted this man, even when overthrown. The depths of\nEurope were full of darkness after Waterloo. Something enormous remained\nlong empty through Napoleon's disappearance.\n\nThe kings placed themselves in this void. Ancient Europe profited by\nit to undertake reforms. There was a Holy Alliance; Belle-Alliance,\nBeautiful Alliance, the fatal field of Waterloo had said in advance.\n\nIn presence and in face of that antique Europe reconstructed, the\nfeatures of a new France were sketched out. The future, which the\nEmperor had rallied, made its entry. On its brow it bore the star,\nLiberty. The glowing eyes of all young generations were turned on it.\nSingular fact! people were, at one and the same time, in love with\nthe future, Liberty, and the past, Napoleon. Defeat had rendered the\nvanquished greater. Bonaparte fallen seemed more lofty than Napoleon\nerect. Those who had triumphed were alarmed. England had him guarded by\nHudson Lowe, and France had him watched by Montchenu. His folded arms\nbecame a source of uneasiness to thrones. Alexander called him \"my\nsleeplessness.\" This terror was the result of the quantity of\nrevolution which was contained in him. That is what explains and excuses\nBonapartist liberalism. This phantom caused the old world to tremble.\nThe kings reigned, but ill at their ease, with the rock of Saint Helena\non the horizon.\n\nWhile Napoleon was passing through the death struggle at Longwood, the\nsixty thousand men who had fallen on the field of Waterloo were quietly\nrotting, and something of their peace was shed abroad over the world.\nThe Congress of Vienna made the treaties in 1815, and Europe called this\nthe Restoration.\n\nThis is what Waterloo was.\n\nBut what matters it to the Infinite? all that tempest, all that cloud,\nthat war, then that peace? All that darkness did not trouble for a\nmoment the light of that immense Eye before which a grub skipping from\none blade of grass to another equals the eagle soaring from belfry to\nbelfry on the towers of Notre Dame.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIX--THE BATTLE-FIELD AT NIGHT\n\nLet us return--it is a necessity in this book--to that fatal\nbattle-field.\n\nOn the 18th of June the moon was full. Its light favored Blucher's\nferocious pursuit, betrayed the traces of the fugitives, delivered\nup that disastrous mass to the eager Prussian cavalry, and aided the\nmassacre. Such tragic favors of the night do occur sometimes during\ncatastrophes.\n\nAfter the last cannon-shot had been fired, the plain of Mont-Saint-Jean\nremained deserted.\n\nThe English occupied the encampment of the French; it is the usual sign\nof victory to sleep in the bed of the vanquished. They established their\nbivouac beyond Rossomme. The Prussians, let loose on the retreating\nrout, pushed forward. Wellington went to the village of Waterloo to draw\nup his report to Lord Bathurst.\n\nIf ever the sic vos non vobis was applicable, it certainly is to that\nvillage of Waterloo. Waterloo took no part, and lay half a league from\nthe scene of action. Mont-Saint-Jean was cannonaded, Hougomont was\nburned, La Haie-Sainte was taken by assault, Papelotte was burned,\nPlancenoit was burned, La Belle-Alliance beheld the embrace of the two\nconquerors; these names are hardly known, and Waterloo, which worked not\nin the battle, bears off all the honor.\n\nWe are not of the number of those who flatter war; when the occasion\npresents itself, we tell the truth about it. War has frightful beauties\nwhich we have not concealed; it has also, we acknowledge, some hideous\nfeatures. One of the most surprising is the prompt stripping of the\nbodies of the dead after the victory. The dawn which follows a battle\nalways rises on naked corpses.\n\nWho does this? Who thus soils the triumph? What hideous, furtive hand is\nthat which is slipped into the pocket of victory? What pickpockets\nare they who ply their trade in the rear of glory? Some\nphilosophers--Voltaire among the number--affirm that it is precisely\nthose persons have made the glory. It is the same men, they say; there\nis no relief corps; those who are erect pillage those who are prone\non the earth. The hero of the day is the vampire of the night. One has\nassuredly the right, after all, to strip a corpse a bit when one is the\nauthor of that corpse. For our own part, we do not think so; it seems\nto us impossible that the same hand should pluck laurels and purloin the\nshoes from a dead man.\n\nOne thing is certain, which is, that generally after conquerors follow\nthieves. But let us leave the soldier, especially the contemporary\nsoldier, out of the question.\n\nEvery army has a rear-guard, and it is that which must be blamed.\nBat-like creatures, half brigands and lackeys; all the sorts of\nvespertillos that that twilight called war engenders; wearers of\nuniforms, who take no part in the fighting; pretended invalids;\nformidable limpers; interloping sutlers, trotting along in little carts,\nsometimes accompanied by their wives, and stealing things which they\nsell again; beggars offering themselves as guides to officers; soldiers'\nservants; marauders; armies on the march in days gone by,--we are not\nspeaking of the present,--dragged all this behind them, so that in the\nspecial language they are called \"stragglers.\" No army, no nation,\nwas responsible for those beings; they spoke Italian and followed the\nGermans, then spoke French and followed the English. It was by one of\nthese wretches, a Spanish straggler who spoke French, that the Marquis\nof Fervacques, deceived by his Picard jargon, and taking him for one\nof our own men, was traitorously slain and robbed on the battle-field\nitself, in the course of the night which followed the victory of\nCerisoles. The rascal sprang from this marauding. The detestable maxim,\nLive on the enemy! produced this leprosy, which a strict discipline\nalone could heal. There are reputations which are deceptive; one does\nnot always know why certain generals, great in other directions, have\nbeen so popular. Turenne was adored by his soldiers because he tolerated\npillage; evil permitted constitutes part of goodness. Turenne was so\ngood that he allowed the Palatinate to be delivered over to fire and\nblood. The marauders in the train of an army were more or less in\nnumber, according as the chief was more or less severe. Hoche and\nMarceau had no stragglers; Wellington had few, and we do him the justice\nto mention it.\n\nNevertheless, on the night from the 18th to the 19th of June, the dead\nwere robbed. Wellington was rigid; he gave orders that any one caught in\nthe act should be shot; but rapine is tenacious. The marauders stole in\none corner of the battlefield while others were being shot in another.\n\nThe moon was sinister over this plain.\n\nTowards midnight, a man was prowling about, or rather, climbing in the\ndirection of the hollow road of Ohain. To all appearance he was one of\nthose whom we have just described,--neither English nor French, neither\npeasant nor soldier, less a man than a ghoul attracted by the scent\nof the dead bodies having theft for his victory, and come to rifle\nWaterloo. He was clad in a blouse that was something like a great coat;\nhe was uneasy and audacious; he walked forwards and gazed behind him.\nWho was this man? The night probably knew more of him than the day. He\nhad no sack, but evidently he had large pockets under his coat. From\ntime to time he halted, scrutinized the plain around him as though to\nsee whether he were observed, bent over abruptly, disturbed something\nsilent and motionless on the ground, then rose and fled. His sliding\nmotion, his attitudes, his mysterious and rapid gestures, caused him\nto resemble those twilight larvae which haunt ruins, and which ancient\nNorman legends call the Alleurs.\n\nCertain nocturnal wading birds produce these silhouettes among the\nmarshes.\n\nA glance capable of piercing all that mist deeply would have perceived\nat some distance a sort of little sutler's wagon with a fluted wicker\nhood, harnessed to a famished nag which was cropping the grass across\nits bit as it halted, hidden, as it were, behind the hovel which adjoins\nthe highway to Nivelles, at the angle of the road from Mont-Saint-Jean\nto Braine l'Alleud; and in the wagon, a sort of woman seated on coffers\nand packages. Perhaps there was some connection between that wagon and\nthat prowler.\n\nThe darkness was serene. Not a cloud in the zenith. What matters it if\nthe earth be red! the moon remains white; these are the indifferences of\nthe sky. In the fields, branches of trees broken by grape-shot, but not\nfallen, upheld by their bark, swayed gently in the breeze of night.\nA breath, almost a respiration, moved the shrubbery. Quivers which\nresembled the departure of souls ran through the grass.\n\nIn the distance the coming and going of patrols and the general rounds\nof the English camp were audible.\n\nHougomont and La Haie-Sainte continued to burn, forming, one in the\nwest, the other in the east, two great flames which were joined by the\ncordon of bivouac fires of the English, like a necklace of rubies\nwith two carbuncles at the extremities, as they extended in an immense\nsemicircle over the hills along the horizon.\n\nWe have described the catastrophe of the road of Ohain. The heart is\nterrified at the thought of what that death must have been to so many\nbrave men.\n\nIf there is anything terrible, if there exists a reality which surpasses\ndreams, it is this: to live, to see the sun; to be in full possession\nof virile force; to possess health and joy; to laugh valiantly; to rush\ntowards a glory which one sees dazzling in front of one; to feel in\none's breast lungs which breathe, a heart which beats, a will which\nreasons; to speak, think, hope, love; to have a mother, to have a wife,\nto have children; to have the light--and all at once, in the space of a\nshout, in less than a minute, to sink into an abyss; to fall, to\nroll, to crush, to be crushed; to see ears of wheat, flowers, leaves,\nbranches; not to be able to catch hold of anything; to feel one's sword\nuseless, men beneath one, horses on top of one; to struggle in vain,\nsince one's bones have been broken by some kick in the darkness; to feel\na heel which makes one's eyes start from their sockets; to bite horses'\nshoes in one's rage; to stifle, to yell, to writhe; to be beneath, and\nto say to one's self, \"But just a little while ago I was a living man!\"\n\nThere, where that lamentable disaster had uttered its death-rattle,\nall was silence now. The edges of the hollow road were encumbered with\nhorses and riders, inextricably heaped up. Terrible entanglement! There\nwas no longer any slope, for the corpses had levelled the road with the\nplain, and reached the brim like a well-filled bushel of barley. A\nheap of dead bodies in the upper part, a river of blood in the lower\npart--such was that road on the evening of the 18th of June, 1815. The\nblood ran even to the Nivelles highway, and there overflowed in a large\npool in front of the abatis of trees which barred the way, at a spot\nwhich is still pointed out.\n\nIt will be remembered that it was at the opposite point, in the\ndirection of the Genappe road, that the destruction of the cuirassiers\nhad taken place. The thickness of the layer of bodies was proportioned\nto the depth of the hollow road. Towards the middle, at the point\nwhere it became level, where Delort's division had passed, the layer of\ncorpses was thinner.\n\nThe nocturnal prowler whom we have just shown to the reader was going\nin that direction. He was searching that vast tomb. He gazed about. He\npassed the dead in some sort of hideous review. He walked with his feet\nin the blood.\n\nAll at once he paused.\n\nA few paces in front of him, in the hollow road, at the point where\nthe pile of dead came to an end, an open hand, illumined by the moon,\nprojected from beneath that heap of men. That hand had on its finger\nsomething sparkling, which was a ring of gold.\n\nThe man bent over, remained in a crouching attitude for a moment, and\nwhen he rose there was no longer a ring on the hand.\n\nHe did not precisely rise; he remained in a stooping and frightened\nattitude, with his back turned to the heap of dead, scanning the horizon\non his knees, with the whole upper portion of his body supported on his\ntwo forefingers, which rested on the earth, and his head peering above\nthe edge of the hollow road. The jackal's four paws suit some actions.\n\nThen coming to a decision, he rose to his feet.\n\nAt that moment, he gave a terrible start. He felt some one clutch him\nfrom behind.\n\nHe wheeled round; it was the open hand, which had closed, and had seized\nthe skirt of his coat.\n\nAn honest man would have been terrified; this man burst into a laugh.\n\n\"Come,\" said he, \"it's only a dead body. I prefer a spook to a\ngendarme.\"\n\nBut the hand weakened and released him. Effort is quickly exhausted in\nthe grave.\n\n\"Well now,\" said the prowler, \"is that dead fellow alive? Let's see.\"\n\nHe bent down again, fumbled among the heap, pushed aside everything that\nwas in his way, seized the hand, grasped the arm, freed the head, pulled\nout the body, and a few moments later he was dragging the lifeless, or\nat least the unconscious, man, through the shadows of hollow road. He\nwas a cuirassier, an officer, and even an officer of considerable rank;\na large gold epaulette peeped from beneath the cuirass; this officer\nno longer possessed a helmet. A furious sword-cut had scarred his face,\nwhere nothing was discernible but blood.\n\nHowever, he did not appear to have any broken limbs, and, by some happy\nchance, if that word is permissible here, the dead had been vaulted\nabove him in such a manner as to preserve him from being crushed. His\neyes were still closed.\n\nOn his cuirass he wore the silver cross of the Legion of Honor.\n\nThe prowler tore off this cross, which disappeared into one of the gulfs\nwhich he had beneath his great coat.\n\nThen he felt of the officer's fob, discovered a watch there, and took\npossession of it. Next he searched his waistcoat, found a purse and\npocketed it.\n\nWhen he had arrived at this stage of succor which he was administering\nto this dying man, the officer opened his eyes.\n\n\"Thanks,\" he said feebly.\n\nThe abruptness of the movements of the man who was manipulating him, the\nfreshness of the night, the air which he could inhale freely, had roused\nhim from his lethargy.\n\nThe prowler made no reply. He raised his head. A sound of footsteps was\naudible in the plain; some patrol was probably approaching.\n\nThe officer murmured, for the death agony was still in his voice:--\n\n\"Who won the battle?\"\n\n\"The English,\" answered the prowler.\n\nThe officer went on:--\n\n\"Look in my pockets; you will find a watch and a purse. Take them.\"\n\nIt was already done.\n\nThe prowler executed the required feint, and said:--\n\n\"There is nothing there.\"\n\n\"I have been robbed,\" said the officer; \"I am sorry for that. You should\nhave had them.\"\n\nThe steps of the patrol became more and more distinct.\n\n\"Some one is coming,\" said the prowler, with the movement of a man who\nis taking his departure.\n\nThe officer raised his arm feebly, and detained him.\n\n\"You have saved my life. Who are you?\"\n\nThe prowler answered rapidly, and in a low voice:--\n\n\"Like yourself, I belonged to the French army. I must leave you. If they\nwere to catch me, they would shoot me. I have saved your life. Now get\nout of the scrape yourself.\"\n\n\"What is your rank?\"\n\n\"Sergeant.\"\n\n\"What is your name?\"\n\n\"Thenardier.\"\n\n\"I shall not forget that name,\" said the officer; \"and do you remember\nmine. My name is Pontmercy.\"\n\n\n\n\nBOOK SECOND.--THE SHIP ORION\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I--NUMBER 24,601 BECOMES NUMBER 9,430\n\nJean Valjean had been recaptured.\n\nThe reader will be grateful to us if we pass rapidly over the sad\ndetails. We will confine ourselves to transcribing two paragraphs\npublished by the journals of that day, a few months after the surprising\nevents which had taken place at M. sur M.\n\nThese articles are rather summary. It must be remembered, that at that\nepoch the Gazette des Tribunaux was not yet in existence.\n\nWe borrow the first from the Drapeau Blanc. It bears the date of July\n25, 1823.\n\n\nAn arrondissement of the Pas de Calais has just been the theatre of an\nevent quite out of the ordinary course. A man, who was a stranger in the\nDepartment, and who bore the name of M. Madeleine, had, thanks to the\nnew methods, resuscitated some years ago an ancient local industry, the\nmanufacture of jet and of black glass trinkets. He had made his fortune\nin the business, and that of the arrondissement as well, we will admit.\nHe had been appointed mayor, in recognition of his services. The police\ndiscovered that M. Madeleine was no other than an ex-convict who had\nbroken his ban, condemned in 1796 for theft, and named Jean Valjean.\nJean Valjean has been recommitted to prison. It appears that previous\nto his arrest he had succeeded in withdrawing from the hands of M.\nLaffitte, a sum of over half a million which he had lodged there, and\nwhich he had, moreover, and by perfectly legitimate means, acquired in\nhis business. No one has been able to discover where Jean Valjean has\nconcealed this money since his return to prison at Toulon.\n\n\nThe second article, which enters a little more into detail, is an\nextract from the Journal de Paris, of the same date.\n\nA former convict, who had been liberated, named Jean Valjean, has just\nappeared before the Court of Assizes of the Var, under circumstances\ncalculated to attract attention. This wretch had succeeded in escaping\nthe vigilance of the police, he had changed his name, and had succeeded\nin getting himself appointed mayor of one of our small northern towns;\nin this town he had established a considerable commerce. He has at last\nbeen unmasked and arrested, thanks to the indefatigable zeal of the\npublic prosecutor. He had for his concubine a woman of the town, who\ndied of a shock at the moment of his arrest. This scoundrel, who is\nendowed with Herculean strength, found means to escape; but three or\nfour days after his flight the police laid their hands on him once more,\nin Paris itself, at the very moment when he was entering one of those\nlittle vehicles which run between the capital and the village of\nMontfermeil (Seine-et-Oise). He is said to have profited by this\ninterval of three or four days of liberty, to withdraw a considerable\nsum deposited by him with one of our leading bankers. This sum has been\nestimated at six or seven hundred thousand francs. If the indictment is\nto be trusted, he has hidden it in some place known to himself alone,\nand it has not been possible to lay hands on it. However that may be,\nthe said Jean Valjean has just been brought before the Assizes of the\nDepartment of the Var as accused of highway robbery accompanied with\nviolence, about eight years ago, on the person of one of those honest\nchildren who, as the patriarch of Ferney has said, in immortal verse,\n\n\n          \". . . Arrive from Savoy every year,\n           And who, with gentle hands, do clear\n           Those long canals choked up with soot.\"\n\n\nThis bandit refused to defend himself. It was proved by the skilful and\neloquent representative of the public prosecutor, that the theft was\ncommitted in complicity with others, and that Jean Valjean was a member\nof a band of robbers in the south. Jean Valjean was pronounced guilty\nand was condemned to the death penalty in consequence. This criminal\nrefused to lodge an appeal. The king, in his inexhaustible clemency, has\ndeigned to commute his penalty to that of penal servitude for life. Jean\nValjean was immediately taken to the prison at Toulon.\n\n\nThe reader has not forgotten that Jean Valjean had religious habits at\nM. sur M. Some papers, among others the Constitutional, presented this\ncommutation as a triumph of the priestly party.\n\nJean Valjean changed his number in the galleys. He was called 9,430.\n\nHowever, and we will mention it at once in order that we may not be\nobliged to recur to the subject, the prosperity of M. sur M. vanished\nwith M. Madeleine; all that he had foreseen during his night of fever\nand hesitation was realized; lacking him, there actually was a soul\nlacking. After this fall, there took place at M. sur M. that egotistical\ndivision of great existences which have fallen, that fatal dismemberment\nof flourishing things which is accomplished every day, obscurely, in\nthe human community, and which history has noted only once, because it\noccurred after the death of Alexander. Lieutenants are crowned kings;\nsuperintendents improvise manufacturers out of themselves. Envious\nrivalries arose. M. Madeleine's vast workshops were shut; his buildings\nfell to ruin, his workmen were scattered. Some of them quitted the\ncountry, others abandoned the trade. Thenceforth, everything was done\non a small scale, instead of on a grand scale; for lucre instead of\nthe general good. There was no longer a centre; everywhere there\nwas competition and animosity. M. Madeleine had reigned over all and\ndirected all. No sooner had he fallen, than each pulled things to\nhimself; the spirit of combat succeeded to the spirit of organization,\nbitterness to cordiality, hatred of one another to the benevolence of\nthe founder towards all; the threads which M. Madeleine had set were\ntangled and broken, the methods were adulterated, the products were\ndebased, confidence was killed; the market diminished, for lack of\norders; salaries were reduced, the workshops stood still, bankruptcy\narrived. And then there was nothing more for the poor. All had vanished.\n\nThe state itself perceived that some one had been crushed somewhere.\nLess than four years after the judgment of the Court of Assizes\nestablishing the identity of Jean Valjean and M. Madeleine, for the\nbenefit of the galleys, the cost of collecting taxes had doubled in the\narrondissement of M. sur M.; and M. de Villele called attention to the\nfact in the rostrum, in the month of February, 1827.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II--IN WHICH THE READER WILL PERUSE TWO VERSES, WHICH ARE OF THE\nDEVIL'S COMPOSITION, POSSIBLY\n\nBefore proceeding further, it will be to the purpose to narrate in some\ndetail, a singular occurrence which took place at about the same epoch,\nin Montfermeil, and which is not lacking in coincidence with certain\nconjectures of the indictment.\n\nThere exists in the region of Montfermeil a very ancient superstition,\nwhich is all the more curious and all the more precious, because\na popular superstition in the vicinity of Paris is like an aloe in\nSiberia. We are among those who respect everything which is in the\nnature of a rare plant. Here, then, is the superstition of Montfermeil:\nit is thought that the devil, from time immemorial, has selected the\nforest as a hiding-place for his treasures. Goodwives affirm that it is\nno rarity to encounter at nightfall, in secluded nooks of the forest,\na black man with the air of a carter or a wood-chopper, wearing wooden\nshoes, clad in trousers and a blouse of linen, and recognizable by the\nfact, that, instead of a cap or hat, he has two immense horns on his\nhead. This ought, in fact, to render him recognizable. This man is\nhabitually engaged in digging a hole. There are three ways of profiting\nby such an encounter. The first is to approach the man and speak to him.\nThen it is seen that the man is simply a peasant, that he appears black\nbecause it is nightfall; that he is not digging any hole whatever, but\nis cutting grass for his cows, and that what had been taken for horns\nis nothing but a dung-fork which he is carrying on his back, and whose\nteeth, thanks to the perspective of evening, seemed to spring from his\nhead. The man returns home and dies within the week. The second way is\nto watch him, to wait until he has dug his hole, until he has filled it\nand has gone away; then to run with great speed to the trench, to\nopen it once more and to seize the \"treasure\" which the black man\nhas necessarily placed there. In this case one dies within the month.\nFinally, the last method is not to speak to the black man, not to look\nat him, and to flee at the best speed of one's legs. One then dies\nwithin the year.\n\nAs all three methods are attended with their special inconveniences, the\nsecond, which at all events, presents some advantages, among others that\nof possessing a treasure, if only for a month, is the one most generally\nadopted. So bold men, who are tempted by every chance, have quite\nfrequently, as we are assured, opened the holes excavated by the black\nman, and tried to rob the devil. The success of the operation appears\nto be but moderate. At least, if the tradition is to be believed, and in\nparticular the two enigmatical lines in barbarous Latin, which an\nevil Norman monk, a bit of a sorcerer, named Tryphon has left on\nthis subject. This Tryphon is buried at the Abbey of Saint-Georges de\nBocherville, near Rouen, and toads spawn on his grave.\n\nAccordingly, enormous efforts are made. Such trenches are ordinarily\nextremely deep; a man sweats, digs, toils all night--for it must be done\nat night; he wets his shirt, burns out his candle, breaks his mattock,\nand when he arrives at the bottom of the hole, when he lays his hand on\nthe \"treasure,\" what does he find? What is the devil's treasure? A sou,\nsometimes a crown-piece, a stone, a skeleton, a bleeding body, sometimes\na spectre folded in four like a sheet of paper in a portfolio,\nsometimes nothing. This is what Tryphon's verses seem to announce to the\nindiscreet and curious:--\n\n          \"Fodit, et in fossa thesauros condit opaca,\n           As, nummas, lapides, cadaver, simulacra, nihilque.\"\n\n\nIt seems that in our day there is sometimes found a powder-horn with\nbullets, sometimes an old pack of cards greasy and worn, which has\nevidently served the devil. Tryphon does not record these two finds,\nsince Tryphon lived in the twelfth century, and since the devil does not\nappear to have had the wit to invent powder before Roger Bacon's time,\nand cards before the time of Charles VI.\n\nMoreover, if one plays at cards, one is sure to lose all that one\npossesses! and as for the powder in the horn, it possesses the property\nof making your gun burst in your face.\n\nNow, a very short time after the epoch when it seemed to the prosecuting\nattorney that the liberated convict Jean Valjean during his flight of\nseveral days had been prowling around Montfermeil, it was remarked in\nthat village that a certain old road-laborer, named Boulatruelle, had\n\"peculiar ways\" in the forest. People thereabouts thought they knew that\nthis Boulatruelle had been in the galleys. He was subjected to\ncertain police supervision, and, as he could find work nowhere, the\nadministration employed him at reduced rates as a road-mender on the\ncross-road from Gagny to Lagny.\n\nThis Boulatruelle was a man who was viewed with disfavor by the\ninhabitants of the district as too respectful, too humble, too prompt in\nremoving his cap to every one, and trembling and smiling in the presence\nof the gendarmes,--probably affiliated to robber bands, they said;\nsuspected of lying in ambush at verge of copses at nightfall. The only\nthing in his favor was that he was a drunkard.\n\nThis is what people thought they had noticed:--\n\nOf late, Boulatruelle had taken to quitting his task of stone-breaking\nand care of the road at a very early hour, and to betaking himself to\nthe forest with his pickaxe. He was encountered towards evening in\nthe most deserted clearings, in the wildest thickets; and he had the\nappearance of being in search of something, and sometimes he was digging\nholes. The goodwives who passed took him at first for Beelzebub; then\nthey recognized Boulatruelle, and were not in the least reassured\nthereby. These encounters seemed to cause Boulatruelle a lively\ndispleasure. It was evident that he sought to hide, and that there was\nsome mystery in what he was doing.\n\nIt was said in the village: \"It is clear that the devil has appeared.\nBoulatruelle has seen him, and is on the search. In sooth, he is cunning\nenough to pocket Lucifer's hoard.\"\n\nThe Voltairians added, \"Will Boulatruelle catch the devil, or will the\ndevil catch Boulatruelle?\" The old women made a great many signs of the\ncross.\n\nIn the meantime, Boulatruelle's manoeuvres in the forest ceased; and he\nresumed his regular occupation of roadmending; and people gossiped of\nsomething else.\n\nSome persons, however, were still curious, surmising that in all this\nthere was probably no fabulous treasure of the legends, but some\nfine windfall of a more serious and palpable sort than the devil's\nbank-bills, and that the road-mender had half discovered the secret. The\nmost \"puzzled\" were the school-master and Thenardier, the proprietor of\nthe tavern, who was everybody's friend, and had not disdained to ally\nhimself with Boulatruelle.\n\n\"He has been in the galleys,\" said Thenardier. \"Eh! Good God! no one\nknows who has been there or will be there.\"\n\nOne evening the schoolmaster affirmed that in former times the law would\nhave instituted an inquiry as to what Boulatruelle did in the forest,\nand that the latter would have been forced to speak, and that he would\nhave been put to the torture in case of need, and that Boulatruelle\nwould not have resisted the water test, for example. \"Let us put him to\nthe wine test,\" said Thenardier.\n\nThey made an effort, and got the old road-mender to drinking.\nBoulatruelle drank an enormous amount, but said very little. He combined\nwith admirable art, and in masterly proportions, the thirst of a\ngormandizer with the discretion of a judge. Nevertheless, by dint of\nreturning to the charge and of comparing and putting together the few\nobscure words which he did allow to escape him, this is what Thenardier\nand the schoolmaster imagined that they had made out:--\n\nOne morning, when Boulatruelle was on his way to his work, at daybreak,\nhe had been surprised to see, at a nook of the forest in the underbrush,\na shovel and a pickaxe, concealed, as one might say.\n\nHowever, he might have supposed that they were probably the shovel and\npick of Father Six-Fours, the water-carrier, and would have thought no\nmore about it. But, on the evening of that day, he saw, without being\nseen himself, as he was hidden by a large tree, \"a person who did not\nbelong in those parts, and whom he, Boulatruelle, knew well,\" directing\nhis steps towards the densest part of the wood. Translation by\nThenardier: A comrade of the galleys. Boulatruelle obstinately refused\nto reveal his name. This person carried a package--something square,\nlike a large box or a small trunk. Surprise on the part of Boulatruelle.\nHowever, it was only after the expiration of seven or eight minutes that\nthe idea of following that \"person\" had occurred to him. But it was too\nlate; the person was already in the thicket, night had descended, and\nBoulatruelle had not been able to catch up with him. Then he had\nadopted the course of watching for him at the edge of the woods. \"It was\nmoonlight.\" Two or three hours later, Boulatruelle had seen this person\nemerge from the brushwood, carrying no longer the coffer, but a shovel\nand pick. Boulatruelle had allowed the person to pass, and had not\ndreamed of accosting him, because he said to himself that the other man\nwas three times as strong as he was, and armed with a pickaxe, and that\nhe would probably knock him over the head on recognizing him, and on\nperceiving that he was recognized. Touching effusion of two old comrades\non meeting again. But the shovel and pick had served as a ray of light\nto Boulatruelle; he had hastened to the thicket in the morning, and had\nfound neither shovel nor pick. From this he had drawn the inference that\nthis person, once in the forest, had dug a hole with his pick, buried\nthe coffer, and reclosed the hole with his shovel. Now, the coffer was\ntoo small to contain a body; therefore it contained money. Hence his\nresearches. Boulatruelle had explored, sounded, searched the entire\nforest and the thicket, and had dug wherever the earth appeared to him\nto have been recently turned up. In vain.\n\nHe had \"ferreted out\" nothing. No one in Montfermeil thought any more\nabout it. There were only a few brave gossips, who said, \"You may be\ncertain that the mender on the Gagny road did not take all that trouble\nfor nothing; he was sure that the devil had come.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III--THE ANKLE-CHAIN MUST HAVE UNDERGONE A CERTAIN PREPARATORY\nMANIPULATION TO BE THUS BROKEN WITH A BLOW FROM A HAMMER\n\nTowards the end of October, in that same year, 1823, the inhabitants of\nToulon beheld the entry into their port, after heavy weather, and for\nthe purpose of repairing some damages, of the ship Orion, which was\nemployed later at Brest as a school-ship, and which then formed a part\nof the Mediterranean squadron.\n\nThis vessel, battered as it was,--for the sea had handled it\nroughly,--produced a fine effect as it entered the roads. It flew some\ncolors which procured for it the regulation salute of eleven guns, which\nit returned, shot for shot; total, twenty-two. It has been calculated\nthat what with salvos, royal and military politenesses, courteous\nexchanges of uproar, signals of etiquette, formalities of roadsteads and\ncitadels, sunrises and sunsets, saluted every day by all fortresses and\nall ships of war, openings and closings of ports, etc., the civilized\nworld, discharged all over the earth, in the course of four and twenty\nhours, one hundred and fifty thousand useless shots. At six francs the\nshot, that comes to nine hundred thousand francs a day, three hundred\nmillions a year, which vanish in smoke. This is a mere detail. All this\ntime the poor were dying of hunger.\n\nThe year 1823 was what the Restoration called \"the epoch of the Spanish\nwar.\"\n\nThis war contained many events in one, and a quantity of peculiarities.\nA grand family affair for the house of Bourbon; the branch of France\nsuccoring and protecting the branch of Madrid, that is to say,\nperforming an act devolving on the elder; an apparent return to our\nnational traditions, complicated by servitude and by subjection to the\ncabinets of the North; M. le Duc d'Angouleme, surnamed by the liberal\nsheets the hero of Andujar, compressing in a triumphal attitude that\nwas somewhat contradicted by his peaceable air, the ancient and very\npowerful terrorism of the Holy Office at variance with the chimerical\nterrorism of the liberals; the sansculottes resuscitated, to the great\nterror of dowagers, under the name of descamisados; monarchy opposing an\nobstacle to progress described as anarchy; the theories of '89 roughly\ninterrupted in the sap; a European halt, called to the French idea,\nwhich was making the tour of the world; beside the son of France as\ngeneralissimo, the Prince de Carignan, afterwards Charles Albert,\nenrolling himself in that crusade of kings against people as a\nvolunteer, with grenadier epaulets of red worsted; the soldiers of the\nEmpire setting out on a fresh campaign, but aged, saddened, after eight\nyears of repose, and under the white cockade; the tricolored standard\nwaved abroad by a heroic handful of Frenchmen, as the white standard had\nbeen thirty years earlier at Coblentz; monks mingled with our troops;\nthe spirit of liberty and of novelty brought to its senses by bayonets;\nprinciples slaughtered by cannonades; France undoing by her arms that\nwhich she had done by her mind; in addition to this, hostile leaders\nsold, soldiers hesitating, cities besieged by millions; no military\nperils, and yet possible explosions, as in every mine which is surprised\nand invaded; but little bloodshed, little honor won, shame for some,\nglory for no one. Such was this war, made by the princes descended from\nLouis XIV., and conducted by generals who had been under Napoleon. Its\nsad fate was to recall neither the grand war nor grand politics.\n\nSome feats of arms were serious; the taking of the Trocadero, among\nothers, was a fine military action; but after all, we repeat, the\ntrumpets of this war give back a cracked sound, the whole effect was\nsuspicious; history approves of France for making a difficulty about\naccepting this false triumph. It seemed evident that certain Spanish\nofficers charged with resistance yielded too easily; the idea of\ncorruption was connected with the victory; it appears as though generals\nand not battles had been won, and the conquering soldier returned\nhumiliated. A debasing war, in short, in which the Bank of France could\nbe read in the folds of the flag.\n\nSoldiers of the war of 1808, on whom Saragossa had fallen in formidable\nruin, frowned in 1823 at the easy surrender of citadels, and began to\nregret Palafox. It is the nature of France to prefer to have Rostopchine\nrather than Ballesteros in front of her.\n\nFrom a still more serious point of view, and one which it is also proper\nto insist upon here, this war, which wounded the military spirit\nof France, enraged the democratic spirit. It was an enterprise of\ninthralment. In that campaign, the object of the French soldier, the\nson of democracy, was the conquest of a yoke for others. A hideous\ncontradiction. France is made to arouse the soul of nations, not to\nstifle it. All the revolutions of Europe since 1792 are the French\nRevolution: liberty darts rays from France. That is a solar fact. Blind\nis he who will not see! It was Bonaparte who said it.\n\nThe war of 1823, an outrage on the generous Spanish nation, was then,\nat the same time, an outrage on the French Revolution. It was France\nwho committed this monstrous violence; by foul means, for, with the\nexception of wars of liberation, everything that armies do is by foul\nmeans. The words passive obedience indicate this. An army is a strange\nmasterpiece of combination where force results from an enormous sum\nof impotence. Thus is war, made by humanity against humanity, despite\nhumanity, explained.\n\nAs for the Bourbons, the war of 1823 was fatal to them. They took it for\na success. They did not perceive the danger that lies in having an idea\nslain to order. They went astray, in their innocence, to such a degree\nthat they introduced the immense enfeeblement of a crime into their\nestablishment as an element of strength. The spirit of the ambush\nentered into their politics. 1830 had its germ in 1823. The Spanish\ncampaign became in their counsels an argument for force and for\nadventures by right Divine. France, having re-established elrey netto\nin Spain, might well have re-established the absolute king at home. They\nfell into the alarming error of taking the obedience of the soldier for\nthe consent of the nation. Such confidence is the ruin of thrones. It is\nnot permitted to fall asleep, either in the shadow of a machineel tree,\nnor in the shadow of an army.\n\nLet us return to the ship Orion.\n\nDuring the operations of the army commanded by the prince generalissimo,\na squadron had been cruising in the Mediterranean. We have just stated\nthat the Orion belonged to this fleet, and that accidents of the sea had\nbrought it into port at Toulon.\n\nThe presence of a vessel of war in a port has something about it which\nattracts and engages a crowd. It is because it is great, and the crowd\nloves what is great.\n\nA ship of the line is one of the most magnificent combinations of the\ngenius of man with the powers of nature.\n\nA ship of the line is composed, at the same time, of the heaviest and\nthe lightest of possible matter, for it deals at one and the same time\nwith three forms of substance,--solid, liquid, and fluid,--and it must\ndo battle with all three. It has eleven claws of iron with which to\nseize the granite on the bottom of the sea, and more wings and more\nantennae than winged insects, to catch the wind in the clouds. Its\nbreath pours out through its hundred and twenty cannons as through\nenormous trumpets, and replies proudly to the thunder. The ocean seeks\nto lead it astray in the alarming sameness of its billows, but the\nvessel has its soul, its compass, which counsels it and always shows it\nthe north. In the blackest nights, its lanterns supply the place of\nthe stars. Thus, against the wind, it has its cordage and its canvas;\nagainst the water, wood; against the rocks, its iron, brass, and lead;\nagainst the shadows, its light; against immensity, a needle.\n\nIf one wishes to form an idea of all those gigantic proportions which,\ntaken as a whole, constitute the ship of the line, one has only to enter\none of the six-story covered construction stocks, in the ports of Brest\nor Toulon. The vessels in process of construction are under a bell-glass\nthere, as it were. This colossal beam is a yard; that great column of\nwood which stretches out on the earth as far as the eye can reach is\nthe main-mast. Taking it from its root in the stocks to its tip in the\nclouds, it is sixty fathoms long, and its diameter at its base is\nthree feet. The English main-mast rises to a height of two hundred and\nseventeen feet above the water-line. The navy of our fathers employed\ncables, ours employs chains. The simple pile of chains on a ship of a\nhundred guns is four feet high, twenty feet in breadth, and eight\nfeet in depth. And how much wood is required to make this ship? Three\nthousand cubic metres. It is a floating forest.\n\nAnd moreover, let this be borne in mind, it is only a question here of\nthe military vessel of forty years ago, of the simple sailing-vessel;\nsteam, then in its infancy, has since added new miracles to that prodigy\nwhich is called a war vessel. At the present time, for example, the\nmixed vessel with a screw is a surprising machine, propelled by three\nthousand square metres of canvas and by an engine of two thousand five\nhundred horse-power.\n\nNot to mention these new marvels, the ancient vessel of Christopher\nColumbus and of De Ruyter is one of the masterpieces of man. It is as\ninexhaustible in force as is the Infinite in gales; it stores up\nthe wind in its sails, it is precise in the immense vagueness of the\nbillows, it floats, and it reigns.\n\nThere comes an hour, nevertheless, when the gale breaks that sixty-foot\nyard like a straw, when the wind bends that mast four hundred feet tall,\nwhen that anchor, which weighs tens of thousands, is twisted in the jaws\nof the waves like a fisherman's hook in the jaws of a pike, when those\nmonstrous cannons utter plaintive and futile roars, which the hurricane\nbears forth into the void and into night, when all that power and all\nthat majesty are engulfed in a power and majesty which are superior.\n\nEvery time that immense force is displayed to culminate in an immense\nfeebleness it affords men food for thought, Hence in the ports curious\npeople abound around these marvellous machines of war and of navigation,\nwithout being able to explain perfectly to themselves why. Every day,\naccordingly, from morning until night, the quays, sluices, and the\njetties of the port of Toulon were covered with a multitude of idlers\nand loungers, as they say in Paris, whose business consisted in staring\nat the Orion.\n\nThe Orion was a ship that had been ailing for a long time; in the course\nof its previous cruises thick layers of barnacles had collected on its\nkeel to such a degree as to deprive it of half its speed; it had gone\ninto the dry dock the year before this, in order to have the barnacles\nscraped off, then it had put to sea again; but this cleaning had\naffected the bolts of the keel: in the neighborhood of the Balearic\nIsles the sides had been strained and had opened; and, as the plating\nin those days was not of sheet iron, the vessel had sprung a leak.\nA violent equinoctial gale had come up, which had first staved in\na grating and a porthole on the larboard side, and damaged the\nforetop-gallant-shrouds; in consequence of these injuries, the Orion had\nrun back to Toulon.\n\nIt anchored near the Arsenal; it was fully equipped, and repairs were\nbegun. The hull had received no damage on the starboard, but some of the\nplanks had been unnailed here and there, according to custom, to permit\nof air entering the hold.\n\nOne morning the crowd which was gazing at it witnessed an accident.\n\n[Illustration: The Ship Orion, An Accident 2b2-1-the-ship-orion]\n\nThe crew was busy bending the sails; the topman, who had to take the\nupper corner of the main-top-sail on the starboard, lost his balance;\nhe was seen to waver; the multitude thronging the Arsenal quay uttered a\ncry; the man's head overbalanced his body; the man fell around the yard,\nwith his hands outstretched towards the abyss; on his way he seized the\nfootrope, first with one hand, then with the other, and remained hanging\nfrom it: the sea lay below him at a dizzy depth; the shock of his fall\nhad imparted to the foot-rope a violent swinging motion; the man swayed\nback and forth at the end of that rope, like a stone in a sling.\n\nIt was incurring a frightful risk to go to his assistance; not one\nof the sailors, all fishermen of the coast, recently levied for the\nservice, dared to attempt it. In the meantime, the unfortunate topman\nwas losing his strength; his anguish could not be discerned on his face,\nbut his exhaustion was visible in every limb; his arms were contracted\nin horrible twitchings; every effort which he made to re-ascend served\nbut to augment the oscillations of the foot-rope; he did not shout, for\nfear of exhausting his strength. All were awaiting the minute when he\nshould release his hold on the rope, and, from instant to instant, heads\nwere turned aside that his fall might not be seen. There are moments\nwhen a bit of rope, a pole, the branch of a tree, is life itself, and\nit is a terrible thing to see a living being detach himself from it and\nfall like a ripe fruit.\n\nAll at once a man was seen climbing into the rigging with the agility\nof a tiger-cat; this man was dressed in red; he was a convict; he wore a\ngreen cap; he was a life convict. On arriving on a level with the top, a\ngust of wind carried away his cap, and allowed a perfectly white head to\nbe seen: he was not a young man.\n\nA convict employed on board with a detachment from the galleys had, in\nfact, at the very first instant, hastened to the officer of the watch,\nand, in the midst of the consternation and the hesitation of the crew,\nwhile all the sailors were trembling and drawing back, he had asked\nthe officer's permission to risk his life to save the topman; at an\naffirmative sign from the officer he had broken the chain riveted to his\nankle with one blow of a hammer, then he had caught up a rope, and had\ndashed into the rigging: no one noticed, at the instant, with what ease\nthat chain had been broken; it was only later on that the incident was\nrecalled.\n\nIn a twinkling he was on the yard; he paused for a few seconds and\nappeared to be measuring it with his eye; these seconds, during which\nthe breeze swayed the topman at the extremity of a thread, seemed\ncenturies to those who were looking on. At last, the convict raised his\neyes to heaven and advanced a step: the crowd drew a long breath. He was\nseen to run out along the yard: on arriving at the point, he fastened\nthe rope which he had brought to it, and allowed the other end to hang\ndown, then he began to descend the rope, hand over hand, and then,--and\nthe anguish was indescribable,--instead of one man suspended over the\ngulf, there were two.\n\nOne would have said it was a spider coming to seize a fly, only here the\nspider brought life, not death. Ten thousand glances were fastened on\nthis group; not a cry, not a word; the same tremor contracted every\nbrow; all mouths held their breath as though they feared to add the\nslightest puff to the wind which was swaying the two unfortunate men.\n\nIn the meantime, the convict had succeeded in lowering himself to a\nposition near the sailor. It was high time; one minute more, and the\nexhausted and despairing man would have allowed himself to fall into\nthe abyss. The convict had moored him securely with the cord to which\nhe clung with one hand, while he was working with the other. At last, he\nwas seen to climb back on the yard, and to drag the sailor up after him;\nhe held him there a moment to allow him to recover his strength, then he\ngrasped him in his arms and carried him, walking on the yard himself to\nthe cap, and from there to the main-top, where he left him in the hands\nof his comrades.\n\nAt that moment the crowd broke into applause: old convict-sergeants\namong them wept, and women embraced each other on the quay, and all\nvoices were heard to cry with a sort of tender rage, \"Pardon for that\nman!\"\n\nHe, in the meantime, had immediately begun to make his descent to rejoin\nhis detachment. In order to reach them the more speedily, he dropped\ninto the rigging, and ran along one of the lower yards; all eyes were\nfollowing him. At a certain moment fear assailed them; whether it was\nthat he was fatigued, or that his head turned, they thought they saw him\nhesitate and stagger. All at once the crowd uttered a loud shout: the\nconvict had fallen into the sea.\n\nThe fall was perilous. The frigate Algesiras was anchored alongside the\nOrion, and the poor convict had fallen between the two vessels: it was\nto be feared that he would slip under one or the other of them. Four men\nflung themselves hastily into a boat; the crowd cheered them on;\nanxiety again took possession of all souls; the man had not risen to\nthe surface; he had disappeared in the sea without leaving a ripple, as\nthough he had fallen into a cask of oil: they sounded, they dived. In\nvain. The search was continued until the evening: they did not even find\nthe body.\n\nOn the following day the Toulon newspaper printed these lines:--\n\n\"Nov. 17, 1823. Yesterday, a convict belonging to the detachment on\nboard of the Orion, on his return from rendering assistance to a sailor,\nfell into the sea and was drowned. The body has not yet been found; it\nis supposed that it is entangled among the piles of the Arsenal point:\nthis man was committed under the number 9,430, and his name was Jean\nValjean.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nBOOK THIRD.--ACCOMPLISHMENT OF THE PROMISE MADE TO THE DEAD WOMAN\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I--THE WATER QUESTION AT MONTFERMEIL\n\nMontfermeil is situated between Livry and Chelles, on the southern edge\nof that lofty table-land which separates the Ourcq from the Marne. At\nthe present day it is a tolerably large town, ornamented all the year\nthrough with plaster villas, and on Sundays with beaming bourgeois. In\n1823 there were at Montfermeil neither so many white houses nor so\nmany well-satisfied citizens: it was only a village in the forest. Some\npleasure-houses of the last century were to be met with there, to be\nsure, which were recognizable by their grand air, their balconies in\ntwisted iron, and their long windows, whose tiny panes cast all sorts\nof varying shades of green on the white of the closed shutters; but\nMontfermeil was none the less a village. Retired cloth-merchants and\nrusticating attorneys had not discovered it as yet; it was a peaceful\nand charming place, which was not on the road to anywhere: there people\nlived, and cheaply, that peasant rustic life which is so bounteous and\nso easy; only, water was rare there, on account of the elevation of the\nplateau.\n\nIt was necessary to fetch it from a considerable distance; the end of\nthe village towards Gagny drew its water from the magnificent ponds\nwhich exist in the woods there. The other end, which surrounds the\nchurch and which lies in the direction of Chelles, found drinking-water\nonly at a little spring half-way down the slope, near the road to\nChelles, about a quarter of an hour from Montfermeil.\n\nThus each household found it hard work to keep supplied with water. The\nlarge houses, the aristocracy, of which the Thenardier tavern formed a\npart, paid half a farthing a bucketful to a man who made a business of\nit, and who earned about eight sous a day in his enterprise of supplying\nMontfermeil with water; but this good man only worked until seven\no'clock in the evening in summer, and five in winter; and night once\ncome and the shutters on the ground floor once closed, he who had no\nwater to drink went to fetch it for himself or did without it.\n\nThis constituted the terror of the poor creature whom the reader has\nprobably not forgotten,--little Cosette. It will be remembered that\nCosette was useful to the Thenardiers in two ways: they made the mother\npay them, and they made the child serve them. So when the mother ceased\nto pay altogether, the reason for which we have read in preceding\nchapters, the Thenardiers kept Cosette. She took the place of a servant\nin their house. In this capacity she it was who ran to fetch water when\nit was required. So the child, who was greatly terrified at the idea of\ngoing to the spring at night, took great care that water should never be\nlacking in the house.\n\nChristmas of the year 1823 was particularly brilliant at Montfermeil.\nThe beginning of the winter had been mild; there had been neither snow\nnor frost up to that time. Some mountebanks from Paris had obtained\npermission of the mayor to erect their booths in the principal street of\nthe village, and a band of itinerant merchants, under protection of the\nsame tolerance, had constructed their stalls on the Church Square,\nand even extended them into Boulanger Alley, where, as the reader will\nperhaps remember, the Thenardiers' hostelry was situated. These people\nfilled the inns and drinking-shops, and communicated to that tranquil\nlittle district a noisy and joyous life. In order to play the part of\na faithful historian, we ought even to add that, among the curiosities\ndisplayed in the square, there was a menagerie, in which frightful\nclowns, clad in rags and coming no one knew whence, exhibited to\nthe peasants of Montfermeil in 1823 one of those horrible Brazilian\nvultures, such as our Royal Museum did not possess until 1845, and which\nhave a tricolored cockade for an eye. I believe that naturalists call\nthis bird Caracara Polyborus; it belongs to the order of the Apicides,\nand to the family of the vultures. Some good old Bonapartist soldiers,\nwho had retired to the village, went to see this creature with great\ndevotion. The mountebanks gave out that the tricolored cockade was a\nunique phenomenon made by God expressly for their menagerie.\n\nOn Christmas eve itself, a number of men, carters, and peddlers, were\nseated at table, drinking and smoking around four or five candles in\nthe public room of Thenardier's hostelry. This room resembled all\ndrinking-shop rooms,--tables, pewter jugs, bottles, drinkers, smokers;\nbut little light and a great deal of noise. The date of the year 1823\nwas indicated, nevertheless, by two objects which were then fashionable\nin the bourgeois class: to wit, a kaleidoscope and a lamp of ribbed tin.\nThe female Thenardier was attending to the supper, which was roasting in\nfront of a clear fire; her husband was drinking with his customers and\ntalking politics.\n\nBesides political conversations which had for their principal subjects\nthe Spanish war and M. le Duc d'Angouleme, strictly local parentheses,\nlike the following, were audible amid the uproar:--\n\n\"About Nanterre and Suresnes the vines have flourished greatly. When\nten pieces were reckoned on there have been twelve. They have yielded a\ngreat deal of juice under the press.\" \"But the grapes cannot be ripe?\"\n\"In those parts the grapes should not be ripe; the wine turns oily as\nsoon as spring comes.\" \"Then it is very thin wine?\" \"There are wines\npoorer even than these. The grapes must be gathered while green.\" Etc.\n\nOr a miller would call out:--\n\n\"Are we responsible for what is in the sacks? We find in them a quantity\nof small seed which we cannot sift out, and which we are obliged to send\nthrough the mill-stones; there are tares, fennel, vetches, hempseed,\nfox-tail, and a host of other weeds, not to mention pebbles, which\nabound in certain wheat, especially in Breton wheat. I am not fond of\ngrinding Breton wheat, any more than long-sawyers like to saw beams with\nnails in them. You can judge of the bad dust that makes in grinding. And\nthen people complain of the flour. They are in the wrong. The flour is\nno fault of ours.\"\n\nIn a space between two windows a mower, who was seated at table with a\nlanded proprietor who was fixing on a price for some meadow work to be\nperformed in the spring, was saying:--\n\n\"It does no harm to have the grass wet. It cuts better. Dew is a good\nthing, sir. It makes no difference with that grass. Your grass is young\nand very hard to cut still. It's terribly tender. It yields before the\niron.\" Etc.\n\nCosette was in her usual place, seated on the cross-bar of the kitchen\ntable near the chimney. She was in rags; her bare feet were thrust into\nwooden shoes, and by the firelight she was engaged in knitting woollen\nstockings destined for the young Thenardiers. A very young kitten was\nplaying about among the chairs. Laughter and chatter were audible in\nthe adjoining room, from two fresh children's voices: it was Eponine and\nAzelma.\n\nIn the chimney-corner a cat-o'-nine-tails was hanging on a nail.\n\nAt intervals the cry of a very young child, which was somewhere in the\nhouse, rang through the noise of the dram-shop. It was a little boy\nwho had been born to the Thenardiers during one of the preceding\nwinters,--\"she did not know why,\" she said, \"the result of the\ncold,\"--and who was a little more than three years old. The mother had\nnursed him, but she did not love him. When the persistent clamor of the\nbrat became too annoying, \"Your son is squalling,\" Thenardier would\nsay; \"do go and see what he wants.\" \"Bah!\" the mother would reply, \"he\nbothers me.\" And the neglected child continued to shriek in the dark.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II--TWO COMPLETE PORTRAITS\n\nSo far in this book the Thenardiers have been viewed only in profile;\nthe moment has arrived for making the circuit of this couple, and\nconsidering it under all its aspects.\n\nThenardier had just passed his fiftieth birthday; Madame Thenardier was\napproaching her forties, which is equivalent to fifty in a woman; so\nthat there existed a balance of age between husband and wife.\n\nOur readers have possibly preserved some recollection of this Thenardier\nwoman, ever since her first appearance,--tall, blond, red, fat, angular,\nsquare, enormous, and agile; she belonged, as we have said, to the\nrace of those colossal wild women, who contort themselves at fairs with\npaving-stones hanging from their hair. She did everything about the\nhouse,--made the beds, did the washing, the cooking, and everything\nelse. Cosette was her only servant; a mouse in the service of an\nelephant. Everything trembled at the sound of her voice,--window panes,\nfurniture, and people. Her big face, dotted with red blotches,\npresented the appearance of a skimmer. She had a beard. She was an ideal\nmarket-porter dressed in woman's clothes. She swore splendidly; she\nboasted of being able to crack a nut with one blow of her fist. Except\nfor the romances which she had read, and which made the affected lady\npeep through the ogress at times, in a very queer way, the idea would\nnever have occurred to any one to say of her, \"That is a woman.\"\nThis Thenardier female was like the product of a wench engrafted on a\nfishwife. When one heard her speak, one said, \"That is a gendarme\"; when\none saw her drink, one said, \"That is a carter\"; when one saw her handle\nCosette, one said, \"That is the hangman.\" One of her teeth projected\nwhen her face was in repose.\n\nThenardier was a small, thin, pale, angular, bony, feeble man, who had\na sickly air and who was wonderfully healthy. His cunning began here;\nhe smiled habitually, by way of precaution, and was almost polite to\neverybody, even to the beggar to whom he refused half a farthing. He had\nthe glance of a pole-cat and the bearing of a man of letters. He greatly\nresembled the portraits of the Abbe Delille. His coquetry consisted in\ndrinking with the carters. No one had ever succeeded in rendering him\ndrunk. He smoked a big pipe. He wore a blouse, and under his blouse an\nold black coat. He made pretensions to literature and to materialism.\nThere were certain names which he often pronounced to support whatever\nthings he might be saying,--Voltaire, Raynal, Parny, and, singularly\nenough, Saint Augustine. He declared that he had \"a system.\" In\naddition, he was a great swindler. A filousophe [philosophe], a\nscientific thief. The species does exist. It will be remembered that he\npretended to have served in the army; he was in the habit of relating\nwith exuberance, how, being a sergeant in the 6th or the 9th light\nsomething or other, at Waterloo, he had alone, and in the presence of a\nsquadron of death-dealing hussars, covered with his body and saved\nfrom death, in the midst of the grape-shot, \"a general, who had been\ndangerously wounded.\" Thence arose for his wall the flaring sign, and\nfor his inn the name which it bore in the neighborhood, of \"the cabaret\nof the Sergeant of Waterloo.\" He was a liberal, a classic, and a\nBonapartist. He had subscribed for the Champ d'Asile. It was said in the\nvillage that he had studied for the priesthood.\n\nWe believe that he had simply studied in Holland for an inn-keeper. This\nrascal of composite order was, in all probability, some Fleming from\nLille, in Flanders, a Frenchman in Paris, a Belgian at Brussels, being\ncomfortably astride of both frontiers. As for his prowess at Waterloo,\nthe reader is already acquainted with that. It will be perceived that\nhe exaggerated it a trifle. Ebb and flow, wandering, adventure, was\nthe leven of his existence; a tattered conscience entails a fragmentary\nlife, and, apparently at the stormy epoch of June 18, 1815, Thenardier\nbelonged to that variety of marauding sutlers of which we have spoken,\nbeating about the country, selling to some, stealing from others, and\ntravelling like a family man, with wife and children, in a rickety\ncart, in the rear of troops on the march, with an instinct for always\nattaching himself to the victorious army. This campaign ended, and\nhaving, as he said, \"some quibus,\" he had come to Montfermeil and set up\nan inn there.\n\nThis quibus, composed of purses and watches, of gold rings and silver\ncrosses, gathered in harvest-time in furrows sown with corpses, did\nnot amount to a large total, and did not carry this sutler turned\neating-house-keeper very far.\n\nThenardier had that peculiar rectilinear something about his gestures\nwhich, accompanied by an oath, recalls the barracks, and by a sign\nof the cross, the seminary. He was a fine talker. He allowed it to be\nthought that he was an educated man. Nevertheless, the schoolmaster had\nnoticed that he pronounced improperly.[12]\n\nHe composed the travellers' tariff card in a superior manner, but\npractised eyes sometimes spied out orthographical errors in it.\nThenardier was cunning, greedy, slothful, and clever. He did not disdain\nhis servants, which caused his wife to dispense with them. This giantess\nwas jealous. It seemed to her that that thin and yellow little man must\nbe an object coveted by all.\n\nThenardier, who was, above all, an astute and well-balanced man, was a\nscamp of a temperate sort. This is the worst species; hypocrisy enters\ninto it.\n\nIt is not that Thenardier was not, on occasion, capable of wrath to\nquite the same degree as his wife; but this was very rare, and at such\ntimes, since he was enraged with the human race in general, as he bore\nwithin him a deep furnace of hatred. And since he was one of those\npeople who are continually avenging their wrongs, who accuse everything\nthat passes before them of everything which has befallen them, and who\nare always ready to cast upon the first person who comes to hand, as a\nlegitimate grievance, the sum total of the deceptions, the bankruptcies,\nand the calamities of their lives,--when all this leaven was stirred up\nin him and boiled forth from his mouth and eyes, he was terrible. Woe to\nthe person who came under his wrath at such a time!\n\nIn addition to his other qualities, Thenardier was attentive and\npenetrating, silent or talkative, according to circumstances, and always\nhighly intelligent. He had something of the look of sailors, who are\naccustomed to screw up their eyes to gaze through marine glasses.\nThenardier was a statesman.\n\nEvery new-comer who entered the tavern said, on catching sight of Madame\nThenardier, \"There is the master of the house.\" A mistake. She was not\neven the mistress. The husband was both master and mistress. She worked;\nhe created. He directed everything by a sort of invisible and constant\nmagnetic action. A word was sufficient for him, sometimes a sign; the\nmastodon obeyed. Thenardier was a sort of special and sovereign being in\nMadame Thenardier's eyes, though she did not thoroughly realize it.\nShe was possessed of virtues after her own kind; if she had ever had a\ndisagreement as to any detail with \"Monsieur Thenardier,\"--which was\nan inadmissible hypothesis, by the way,--she would not have blamed\nher husband in public on any subject whatever. She would never have\ncommitted \"before strangers\" that mistake so often committed by women,\nand which is called in parliamentary language, \"exposing the crown.\"\nAlthough their concord had only evil as its result, there was\ncontemplation in Madame Thenardier's submission to her husband. That\nmountain of noise and of flesh moved under the little finger of that\nfrail despot. Viewed on its dwarfed and grotesque side, this was that\ngrand and universal thing, the adoration of mind by matter; for certain\nugly features have a cause in the very depths of eternal beauty. There\nwas an unknown quantity about Thenardier; hence the absolute empire\nof the man over that woman. At certain moments she beheld him like a\nlighted candle; at others she felt him like a claw.\n\nThis woman was a formidable creature who loved no one except her\nchildren, and who did not fear any one except her husband. She was a\nmother because she was mammiferous. But her maternity stopped short with\nher daughters, and, as we shall see, did not extend to boys. The man had\nbut one thought,--how to enrich himself.\n\nHe did not succeed in this. A theatre worthy of this great talent was\nlacking. Thenardier was ruining himself at Montfermeil, if ruin is\npossible to zero; in Switzerland or in the Pyrenees this penniless scamp\nwould have become a millionaire; but an inn-keeper must browse where\nfate has hitched him.\n\nIt will be understood that the word inn-keeper is here employed in a\nrestricted sense, and does not extend to an entire class.\n\nIn this same year, 1823, Thenardier was burdened with about fifteen\nhundred francs' worth of petty debts, and this rendered him anxious.\n\nWhatever may have been the obstinate injustice of destiny in this case,\nThenardier was one of those men who understand best, with the most\nprofundity and in the most modern fashion, that thing which is a virtue\namong barbarous peoples and an object of merchandise among civilized\npeoples,--hospitality. Besides, he was an admirable poacher, and quoted\nfor his skill in shooting. He had a certain cold and tranquil laugh,\nwhich was particularly dangerous.\n\nHis theories as a landlord sometimes burst forth in lightning flashes.\nHe had professional aphorisms, which he inserted into his wife's mind.\n\"The duty of the inn-keeper,\" he said to her one day, violently, and in\na low voice, \"is to sell to the first comer, stews, repose, light, fire,\ndirty sheets, a servant, lice, and a smile; to stop passers-by, to empty\nsmall purses, and to honestly lighten heavy ones; to shelter travelling\nfamilies respectfully: to shave the man, to pluck the woman, to pick\nthe child clean; to quote the window open, the window shut, the\nchimney-corner, the arm-chair, the chair, the ottoman, the stool, the\nfeather-bed, the mattress and the truss of straw; to know how much\nthe shadow uses up the mirror, and to put a price on it; and, by five\nhundred thousand devils, to make the traveller pay for everything, even\nfor the flies which his dog eats!\"\n\nThis man and this woman were ruse and rage wedded--a hideous and\nterrible team.\n\nWhile the husband pondered and combined, Madame Thenardier thought not\nof absent creditors, took no heed of yesterday nor of to-morrow, and\nlived in a fit of anger, all in a minute.\n\nSuch were these two beings. Cosette was between them, subjected to their\ndouble pressure, like a creature who is at the same time being ground up\nin a mill and pulled to pieces with pincers. The man and the woman each\nhad a different method: Cosette was overwhelmed with blows--this was the\nwoman's; she went barefooted in winter--that was the man's doing.\n\nCosette ran up stairs and down, washed, swept, rubbed, dusted, ran,\nfluttered about, panted, moved heavy articles, and weak as she was,\ndid the coarse work. There was no mercy for her; a fierce mistress and\nvenomous master. The Thenardier hostelry was like a spider's web, in\nwhich Cosette had been caught, and where she lay trembling. The ideal\nof oppression was realized by this sinister household. It was something\nlike the fly serving the spiders.\n\nThe poor child passively held her peace.\n\nWhat takes place within these souls when they have but just quitted God,\nfind themselves thus, at the very dawn of life, very small and in the\nmidst of men all naked!\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III--MEN MUST HAVE WINE, AND HORSES MUST HAVE WATER\n\nFour new travellers had arrived.\n\nCosette was meditating sadly; for, although she was only eight years\nold, she had already suffered so much that she reflected with the\nlugubrious air of an old woman. Her eye was black in consequence of a\nblow from Madame Thenardier's fist, which caused the latter to remark\nfrom time to time, \"How ugly she is with her fist-blow on her eye!\"\n\nCosette was thinking that it was dark, very dark, that the pitchers and\ncaraffes in the chambers of the travellers who had arrived must have\nbeen filled and that there was no more water in the cistern.\n\nShe was somewhat reassured because no one in the Thenardier\nestablishment drank much water. Thirsty people were never lacking there;\nbut their thirst was of the sort which applies to the jug rather than to\nthe pitcher. Any one who had asked for a glass of water among all those\nglasses of wine would have appeared a savage to all these men. But there\ncame a moment when the child trembled; Madame Thenardier raised the\ncover of a stew-pan which was boiling on the stove, then seized a glass\nand briskly approached the cistern. She turned the faucet; the child\nhad raised her head and was following all the woman's movements. A thin\nstream of water trickled from the faucet, and half filled the glass.\n\"Well,\" said she, \"there is no more water!\" A momentary silence ensued.\nThe child did not breathe.\n\n\"Bah!\" resumed Madame Thenardier, examining the half-filled glass, \"this\nwill be enough.\"\n\nCosette applied herself to her work once more, but for a quarter of an\nhour she felt her heart leaping in her bosom like a big snow-flake.\n\nShe counted the minutes that passed in this manner, and wished it were\nthe next morning.\n\nFrom time to time one of the drinkers looked into the street, and\nexclaimed, \"It's as black as an oven!\" or, \"One must needs be a cat\nto go about the streets without a lantern at this hour!\" And Cosette\ntrembled.\n\nAll at once one of the pedlers who lodged in the hostelry entered, and\nsaid in a harsh voice:--\n\n\"My horse has not been watered.\"\n\n\"Yes, it has,\" said Madame Thenardier.\n\n\"I tell you that it has not,\" retorted the pedler.\n\nCosette had emerged from under the table.\n\n\"Oh, yes, sir!\" said she, \"the horse has had a drink; he drank out of a\nbucket, a whole bucketful, and it was I who took the water to him, and I\nspoke to him.\"\n\nIt was not true; Cosette lied.\n\n\"There's a brat as big as my fist who tells lies as big as the house,\"\nexclaimed the pedler. \"I tell you that he has not been watered, you\nlittle jade! He has a way of blowing when he has had no water, which I\nknow well.\"\n\nCosette persisted, and added in a voice rendered hoarse with anguish,\nand which was hardly audible:--\n\n\"And he drank heartily.\"\n\n\"Come,\" said the pedler, in a rage, \"this won't do at all, let my horse\nbe watered, and let that be the end of it!\"\n\nCosette crept under the table again.\n\n\"In truth, that is fair!\" said Madame Thenardier, \"if the beast has not\nbeen watered, it must be.\"\n\nThen glancing about her:--\n\n\"Well, now! Where's that other beast?\"\n\nShe bent down and discovered Cosette cowering at the other end of the\ntable, almost under the drinkers' feet.\n\n\"Are you coming?\" shrieked Madame Thenardier.\n\nCosette crawled out of the sort of hole in which she had hidden herself.\nThe Thenardier resumed:--\n\n\"Mademoiselle Dog-lack-name, go and water that horse.\"\n\n\"But, Madame,\" said Cosette, feebly, \"there is no water.\"\n\nThe Thenardier threw the street door wide open:--\n\n\"Well, go and get some, then!\"\n\nCosette dropped her head, and went for an empty bucket which stood near\nthe chimney-corner.\n\nThis bucket was bigger than she was, and the child could have set down\nin it at her ease.\n\nThe Thenardier returned to her stove, and tasted what was in the\nstewpan, with a wooden spoon, grumbling the while:--\n\n\"There's plenty in the spring. There never was such a malicious creature\nas that. I think I should have done better to strain my onions.\"\n\nThen she rummaged in a drawer which contained sous, pepper, and\nshallots.\n\n\"See here, Mam'selle Toad,\" she added, \"on your way back, you will get a\nbig loaf from the baker. Here's a fifteen-sou piece.\"\n\nCosette had a little pocket on one side of her apron; she took the coin\nwithout saying a word, and put it in that pocket.\n\nThen she stood motionless, bucket in hand, the open door before her. She\nseemed to be waiting for some one to come to her rescue.\n\n\"Get along with you!\" screamed the Thenardier.\n\nCosette went out. The door closed behind her.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV--ENTRANCE ON THE SCENE OF A DOLL\n\nThe line of open-air booths starting at the church, extended, as the\nreader will remember, as far as the hostelry of the Thenardiers. These\nbooths were all illuminated, because the citizens would soon pass on\ntheir way to the midnight mass, with candles burning in paper funnels,\nwhich, as the schoolmaster, then seated at the table at the Thenardiers'\nobserved, produced \"a magical effect.\" In compensation, not a star was\nvisible in the sky.\n\nThe last of these stalls, established precisely opposite the\nThenardiers' door, was a toy-shop all glittering with tinsel, glass,\nand magnificent objects of tin. In the first row, and far forwards, the\nmerchant had placed on a background of white napkins, an immense doll,\nnearly two feet high, who was dressed in a robe of pink crepe, with gold\nwheat-ears on her head, which had real hair and enamel eyes. All that\nday, this marvel had been displayed to the wonderment of all passers-by\nunder ten years of age, without a mother being found in Montfermeil\nsufficiently rich or sufficiently extravagant to give it to her child.\nEponine and Azelma had passed hours in contemplating it, and Cosette\nherself had ventured to cast a glance at it, on the sly, it is true.\n\nAt the moment when Cosette emerged, bucket in hand, melancholy and\novercome as she was, she could not refrain from lifting her eyes to\nthat wonderful doll, towards the lady, as she called it. The poor child\npaused in amazement. She had not yet beheld that doll close to. The\nwhole shop seemed a palace to her: the doll was not a doll; it was a\nvision. It was joy, splendor, riches, happiness, which appeared in\na sort of chimerical halo to that unhappy little being so profoundly\nengulfed in gloomy and chilly misery. With the sad and innocent sagacity\nof childhood, Cosette measured the abyss which separated her from\nthat doll. She said to herself that one must be a queen, or at least a\nprincess, to have a \"thing\" like that. She gazed at that beautiful pink\ndress, that beautiful smooth hair, and she thought, \"How happy that doll\nmust be!\" She could not take her eyes from that fantastic stall. The\nmore she looked, the more dazzled she grew. She thought she was gazing\nat paradise. There were other dolls behind the large one, which seemed\nto her to be fairies and genii. The merchant, who was pacing back and\nforth in front of his shop, produced on her somewhat the effect of being\nthe Eternal Father.\n\nIn this adoration she forgot everything, even the errand with which she\nwas charged.\n\nAll at once the Thenardier's coarse voice recalled her to reality:\n\"What, you silly jade! you have not gone? Wait! I'll give it to you! I\nwant to know what you are doing there! Get along, you little monster!\"\n\nThe Thenardier had cast a glance into the street, and had caught sight\nof Cosette in her ecstasy.\n\nCosette fled, dragging her pail, and taking the longest strides of which\nshe was capable.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V--THE LITTLE ONE ALL ALONE\n\nAs the Thenardier hostelry was in that part of the village which is\nnear the church, it was to the spring in the forest in the direction of\nChelles that Cosette was obliged to go for her water.\n\nShe did not glance at the display of a single other merchant. So long\nas she was in Boulanger Lane and in the neighborhood of the church, the\nlighted stalls illuminated the road; but soon the last light from the\nlast stall vanished. The poor child found herself in the dark. She\nplunged into it. Only, as a certain emotion overcame her, she made as\nmuch motion as possible with the handle of the bucket as she walked\nalong. This made a noise which afforded her company.\n\nThe further she went, the denser the darkness became. There was no one\nin the streets. However, she did encounter a woman, who turned around\non seeing her, and stood still, muttering between her teeth: \"Where can\nthat child be going? Is it a werewolf child?\" Then the woman recognized\nCosette. \"Well,\" said she, \"it's the Lark!\"\n\nIn this manner Cosette traversed the labyrinth of tortuous and deserted\nstreets which terminate in the village of Montfermeil on the side of\nChelles. So long as she had the houses or even the walls only on both\nsides of her path, she proceeded with tolerable boldness. From time\nto time she caught the flicker of a candle through the crack of a\nshutter--this was light and life; there were people there, and it\nreassured her. But in proportion as she advanced, her pace slackened\nmechanically, as it were. When she had passed the corner of the last\nhouse, Cosette paused. It had been hard to advance further than the last\nstall; it became impossible to proceed further than the last house. She\nset her bucket on the ground, thrust her hand into her hair, and\nbegan slowly to scratch her head,--a gesture peculiar to children when\nterrified and undecided what to do. It was no longer Montfermeil; it\nwas the open fields. Black and desert space was before her. She gazed in\ndespair at that darkness, where there was no longer any one, where there\nwere beasts, where there were spectres, possibly. She took a good\nlook, and heard the beasts walking on the grass, and she distinctly saw\nspectres moving in the trees. Then she seized her bucket again; fear had\nlent her audacity. \"Bah!\" said she; \"I will tell him that there was no\nmore water!\" And she resolutely re-entered Montfermeil.\n\nHardly had she gone a hundred paces when she paused and began to scratch\nher head again. Now it was the Thenardier who appeared to her, with her\nhideous, hyena mouth, and wrath flashing in her eyes. The child cast a\nmelancholy glance before her and behind her. What was she to do? What\nwas to become of her? Where was she to go? In front of her was the\nspectre of the Thenardier; behind her all the phantoms of the night\nand of the forest. It was before the Thenardier that she recoiled. She\nresumed her path to the spring, and began to run. She emerged from\nthe village, she entered the forest at a run, no longer looking at or\nlistening to anything. She only paused in her course when her breath\nfailed her; but she did not halt in her advance. She went straight\nbefore her in desperation.\n\nAs she ran she felt like crying.\n\nThe nocturnal quivering of the forest surrounded her completely.\n\nShe no longer thought, she no longer saw. The immensity of night was\nfacing this tiny creature. On the one hand, all shadow; on the other, an\natom.\n\nIt was only seven or eight minutes' walk from the edge of the woods to\nthe spring. Cosette knew the way, through having gone over it many times\nin daylight. Strange to say, she did not get lost. A remnant of instinct\nguided her vaguely. But she did not turn her eyes either to right or to\nleft, for fear of seeing things in the branches and in the brushwood. In\nthis manner she reached the spring.\n\nIt was a narrow, natural basin, hollowed out by the water in a clayey\nsoil, about two feet deep, surrounded with moss and with those tall,\ncrimped grasses which are called Henry IV.'s frills, and paved with\nseveral large stones. A brook ran out of it, with a tranquil little\nnoise.\n\nCosette did not take time to breathe. It was very dark, but she was in\nthe habit of coming to this spring. She felt with her left hand in the\ndark for a young oak which leaned over the spring, and which usually\nserved to support her, found one of its branches, clung to it, bent\ndown, and plunged the bucket in the water. She was in a state of such\nviolent excitement that her strength was trebled. While thus bent over,\nshe did not notice that the pocket of her apron had emptied itself into\nthe spring. The fifteen-sou piece fell into the water. Cosette neither\nsaw nor heard it fall. She drew out the bucket nearly full, and set it\non the grass.\n\nThat done, she perceived that she was worn out with fatigue. She would\nhave liked to set out again at once, but the effort required to fill the\nbucket had been such that she found it impossible to take a step. She\nwas forced to sit down. She dropped on the grass, and remained crouching\nthere.\n\nShe shut her eyes; then she opened them again, without knowing why, but\nbecause she could not do otherwise. The agitated water in the bucket\nbeside her was describing circles which resembled tin serpents.\n\nOverhead the sky was covered with vast black clouds, which were like\nmasses of smoke. The tragic mask of shadow seemed to bend vaguely over\nthe child.\n\nJupiter was setting in the depths.\n\nThe child stared with bewildered eyes at this great star, with which she\nwas unfamiliar, and which terrified her. The planet was, in fact, very\nnear the horizon and was traversing a dense layer of mist which imparted\nto it a horrible ruddy hue. The mist, gloomily empurpled, magnified the\nstar. One would have called it a luminous wound.\n\nA cold wind was blowing from the plain. The forest was dark, not a leaf\nwas moving; there were none of the vague, fresh gleams of summertide.\nGreat boughs uplifted themselves in frightful wise. Slender and\nmisshapen bushes whistled in the clearings. The tall grasses undulated\nlike eels under the north wind. The nettles seemed to twist long arms\nfurnished with claws in search of prey. Some bits of dry heather, tossed\nby the breeze, flew rapidly by, and had the air of fleeing in terror\nbefore something which was coming after. On all sides there were\nlugubrious stretches.\n\nThe darkness was bewildering. Man requires light. Whoever buries himself\nin the opposite of day feels his heart contract. When the eye sees\nblack, the heart sees trouble. In an eclipse in the night, in the sooty\nopacity, there is anxiety even for the stoutest of hearts. No one walks\nalone in the forest at night without trembling. Shadows and trees--two\nformidable densities. A chimerical reality appears in the indistinct\ndepths. The inconceivable is outlined a few paces distant from you with\na spectral clearness. One beholds floating, either in space or in one's\nown brain, one knows not what vague and intangible thing, like the\ndreams of sleeping flowers. There are fierce attitudes on the horizon.\nOne inhales the effluvia of the great black void. One is afraid to\nglance behind him, yet desirous of doing so. The cavities of night,\nthings grown haggard, taciturn profiles which vanish when one advances,\nobscure dishevelments, irritated tufts, livid pools, the lugubrious\nreflected in the funereal, the sepulchral immensity of silence, unknown\nbut possible beings, bendings of mysterious branches, alarming torsos of\ntrees, long handfuls of quivering plants,--against all this one has no\nprotection. There is no hardihood which does not shudder and which does\nnot feel the vicinity of anguish. One is conscious of something hideous,\nas though one's soul were becoming amalgamated with the darkness. This\npenetration of the shadows is indescribably sinister in the case of a\nchild.\n\nForests are apocalypses, and the beating of the wings of a tiny soul\nproduces a sound of agony beneath their monstrous vault.\n\nWithout understanding her sensations, Cosette was conscious that she was\nseized upon by that black enormity of nature; it was no longer terror\nalone which was gaining possession of her; it was something more\nterrible even than terror; she shivered. There are no words to express\nthe strangeness of that shiver which chilled her to the very bottom of\nher heart; her eye grew wild; she thought she felt that she should not\nbe able to refrain from returning there at the same hour on the morrow.\n\nThen, by a sort of instinct, she began to count aloud, one, two, three,\nfour, and so on up to ten, in order to escape from that singular state\nwhich she did not understand, but which terrified her, and, when she had\nfinished, she began again; this restored her to a true perception of\nthe things about her. Her hands, which she had wet in drawing the water,\nfelt cold; she rose; her terror, a natural and unconquerable terror, had\nreturned: she had but one thought now,--to flee at full speed through\nthe forest, across the fields to the houses, to the windows, to the\nlighted candles. Her glance fell upon the water which stood before her;\nsuch was the fright which the Thenardier inspired in her, that she dared\nnot flee without that bucket of water: she seized the handle with both\nhands; she could hardly lift the pail.\n\nIn this manner she advanced a dozen paces, but the bucket was full; it\nwas heavy; she was forced to set it on the ground once more. She took\nbreath for an instant, then lifted the handle of the bucket again, and\nresumed her march, proceeding a little further this time, but again she\nwas obliged to pause. After some seconds of repose she set out again.\nShe walked bent forward, with drooping head, like an old woman; the\nweight of the bucket strained and stiffened her thin arms. The iron\nhandle completed the benumbing and freezing of her wet and tiny hands;\nshe was forced to halt from time to time, and each time that she did so,\nthe cold water which splashed from the pail fell on her bare legs. This\ntook place in the depths of a forest, at night, in winter, far from all\nhuman sight; she was a child of eight: no one but God saw that sad thing\nat the moment.\n\nAnd her mother, no doubt, alas!\n\nFor there are things that make the dead open their eyes in their graves.\n\nShe panted with a sort of painful rattle; sobs contracted her throat,\nbut she dared not weep, so afraid was she of the Thenardier, even at a\ndistance: it was her custom to imagine the Thenardier always present.\n\nHowever, she could not make much headway in that manner, and she went\non very slowly. In spite of diminishing the length of her stops, and\nof walking as long as possible between them, she reflected with anguish\nthat it would take her more than an hour to return to Montfermeil in\nthis manner, and that the Thenardier would beat her. This anguish was\nmingled with her terror at being alone in the woods at night; she was\nworn out with fatigue, and had not yet emerged from the forest. On\narriving near an old chestnut-tree with which she was acquainted, made\na last halt, longer than the rest, in order that she might get well\nrested; then she summoned up all her strength, picked up her bucket\nagain, and courageously resumed her march, but the poor little desperate\ncreature could not refrain from crying, \"O my God! my God!\"\n\nAt that moment she suddenly became conscious that her bucket no longer\nweighed anything at all: a hand, which seemed to her enormous, had just\nseized the handle, and lifted it vigorously. She raised her head. A\nlarge black form, straight and erect, was walking beside her through the\ndarkness; it was a man who had come up behind her, and whose approach\nshe had not heard. This man, without uttering a word, had seized the\nhandle of the bucket which she was carrying.\n\nThere are instincts for all the encounters of life.\n\nThe child was not afraid.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI--WHICH POSSIBLY PROVES BOULATRUELLE'S INTELLIGENCE\n\nOn the afternoon of that same Christmas Day, 1823, a man had walked\nfor rather a long time in the most deserted part of the Boulevard de\nl'Hopital in Paris. This man had the air of a person who is seeking\nlodgings, and he seemed to halt, by preference, at the most modest\nhouses on that dilapidated border of the faubourg Saint-Marceau.\n\nWe shall see further on that this man had, in fact, hired a chamber in\nthat isolated quarter.\n\nThis man, in his attire, as in all his person, realized the type of what\nmay be called the well-bred mendicant,--extreme wretchedness combined\nwith extreme cleanliness. This is a very rare mixture which inspires\nintelligent hearts with that double respect which one feels for the man\nwho is very poor, and for the man who is very worthy. He wore a very\nold and very well brushed round hat; a coarse coat, worn perfectly\nthreadbare, of an ochre yellow, a color that was not in the least\neccentric at that epoch; a large waistcoat with pockets of a venerable\ncut; black breeches, worn gray at the knee, stockings of black worsted;\nand thick shoes with copper buckles. He would have been pronounced a\npreceptor in some good family, returned from the emigration. He would\nhave been taken for more than sixty years of age, from his perfectly\nwhite hair, his wrinkled brow, his livid lips, and his countenance,\nwhere everything breathed depression and weariness of life. Judging from\nhis firm tread, from the singular vigor which stamped all his movements,\nhe would have hardly been thought fifty. The wrinkles on his brow were\nwell placed, and would have disposed in his favor any one who observed\nhim attentively. His lip contracted with a strange fold which seemed\nsevere, and which was humble. There was in the depth of his glance an\nindescribable melancholy serenity. In his left hand he carried a little\nbundle tied up in a handkerchief; in his right he leaned on a sort of a\ncudgel, cut from some hedge. This stick had been carefully trimmed, and\nhad an air that was not too threatening; the most had been made of its\nknots, and it had received a coral-like head, made from red wax: it was\na cudgel, and it seemed to be a cane.\n\nThere are but few passers-by on that boulevard, particularly in the\nwinter. The man seemed to avoid them rather than to seek them, but this\nwithout any affectation.\n\nAt that epoch, King Louis XVIII. went nearly every day to Choisy-le-Roi:\nit was one of his favorite excursions. Towards two o'clock, almost\ninvariably, the royal carriage and cavalcade was seen to pass at full\nspeed along the Boulevard de l'Hopital.\n\nThis served in lieu of a watch or clock to the poor women of the quarter\nwho said, \"It is two o'clock; there he is returning to the Tuileries.\"\n\nAnd some rushed forward, and others drew up in line, for a passing king\nalways creates a tumult; besides, the appearance and disappearance of\nLouis XVIII. produced a certain effect in the streets of Paris. It was\nrapid but majestic. This impotent king had a taste for a fast gallop;\nas he was not able to walk, he wished to run: that cripple would gladly\nhave had himself drawn by the lightning. He passed, pacific and severe,\nin the midst of naked swords. His massive coach, all covered with\ngilding, with great branches of lilies painted on the panels, thundered\nnoisily along. There was hardly time to cast a glance upon it. In the\nrear angle on the right there was visible on tufted cushions of white\nsatin a large, firm, and ruddy face, a brow freshly powdered a l'oiseau\nroyal, a proud, hard, crafty eye, the smile of an educated man, two\ngreat epaulets with bullion fringe floating over a bourgeois coat, the\nGolden Fleece, the cross of Saint Louis, the cross of the Legion of\nHonor, the silver plaque of the Saint-Esprit, a huge belly, and a wide\nblue ribbon: it was the king. Outside of Paris, he held his hat decked\nwith white ostrich plumes on his knees enwrapped in high English\ngaiters; when he re-entered the city, he put on his hat and saluted\nrarely; he stared coldly at the people, and they returned it in kind.\nWhen he appeared for the first time in the Saint-Marceau quarter,\nthe whole success which he produced is contained in this remark of an\ninhabitant of the faubourg to his comrade, \"That big fellow yonder is\nthe government.\"\n\nThis infallible passage of the king at the same hour was, therefore, the\ndaily event of the Boulevard de l'Hopital.\n\nThe promenader in the yellow coat evidently did not belong in the\nquarter, and probably did not belong in Paris, for he was ignorant as to\nthis detail. When, at two o'clock, the royal carriage, surrounded by a\nsquadron of the body-guard all covered with silver lace, debouched\non the boulevard, after having made the turn of the Salpetriere, he\nappeared surprised and almost alarmed. There was no one but himself in\nthis cross-lane. He drew up hastily behind the corner of the wall of an\nenclosure, though this did not prevent M. le Duc de Havre from spying\nhim out.\n\nM. le Duc de Havre, as captain of the guard on duty that day, was seated\nin the carriage, opposite the king. He said to his Majesty, \"Yonder\nis an evil-looking man.\" Members of the police, who were clearing the\nking's route, took equal note of him: one of them received an order to\nfollow him. But the man plunged into the deserted little streets of the\nfaubourg, and as twilight was beginning to fall, the agent lost trace of\nhim, as is stated in a report addressed that same evening to M. le Comte\nd'Angles, Minister of State, Prefect of Police.\n\nWhen the man in the yellow coat had thrown the agent off his track,\nhe redoubled his pace, not without turning round many a time to assure\nhimself that he was not being followed. At a quarter-past four, that is\nto say, when night was fully come, he passed in front of the theatre\nof the Porte Saint-Martin, where The Two Convicts was being played that\nday. This poster, illuminated by the theatre lanterns, struck him; for,\nalthough he was walking rapidly, he halted to read it. An instant later\nhe was in the blind alley of La Planchette, and he entered the Plat\nd'Etain [the Pewter Platter], where the office of the coach for Lagny\nwas then situated. This coach set out at half-past four. The horses were\nharnessed, and the travellers, summoned by the coachman, were hastily\nclimbing the lofty iron ladder of the vehicle.\n\nThe man inquired:--\n\n\"Have you a place?\"\n\n\"Only one--beside me on the box,\" said the coachman.\n\n\"I will take it.\"\n\n\"Climb up.\"\n\nNevertheless, before setting out, the coachman cast a glance at the\ntraveller's shabby dress, at the diminutive size of his bundle, and made\nhim pay his fare.\n\n\"Are you going as far as Lagny?\" demanded the coachman.\n\n\"Yes,\" said the man.\n\nThe traveller paid to Lagny.\n\nThey started. When they had passed the barrier, the coachman tried\nto enter into conversation, but the traveller only replied in\nmonosyllables. The coachman took to whistling and swearing at his\nhorses.\n\nThe coachman wrapped himself up in his cloak. It was cold. The man\ndid not appear to be thinking of that. Thus they passed Gournay and\nNeuilly-sur-Marne.\n\nTowards six o'clock in the evening they reached Chelles. The coachman\ndrew up in front of the carters' inn installed in the ancient buildings\nof the Royal Abbey, to give his horses a breathing spell.\n\n\"I get down here,\" said the man.\n\nHe took his bundle and his cudgel and jumped down from the vehicle.\n\nAn instant later he had disappeared.\n\nHe did not enter the inn.\n\nWhen the coach set out for Lagny a few minutes later, it did not\nencounter him in the principal street of Chelles.\n\nThe coachman turned to the inside travellers.\n\n\"There,\" said he, \"is a man who does not belong here, for I do not know\nhim. He had not the air of owning a sou, but he does not consider money;\nhe pays to Lagny, and he goes only as far as Chelles. It is night; all\nthe houses are shut; he does not enter the inn, and he is not to be\nfound. So he has dived through the earth.\"\n\nThe man had not plunged into the earth, but he had gone with great\nstrides through the dark, down the principal street of Chelles, then he\nhad turned to the right before reaching the church, into the cross-road\nleading to Montfermeil, like a person who was acquainted with the\ncountry and had been there before.\n\nHe followed this road rapidly. At the spot where it is intersected by\nthe ancient tree-bordered road which runs from Gagny to Lagny, he heard\npeople coming. He concealed himself precipitately in a ditch, and there\nwaited until the passers-by were at a distance. The precaution was\nnearly superfluous, however; for, as we have already said, it was a very\ndark December night. Not more than two or three stars were visible in\nthe sky.\n\nIt is at this point that the ascent of the hill begins. The man did not\nreturn to the road to Montfermeil; he struck across the fields to the\nright, and entered the forest with long strides.\n\nOnce in the forest he slackened his pace, and began a careful\nexamination of all the trees, advancing, step by step, as though seeking\nand following a mysterious road known to himself alone. There came a\nmoment when he appeared to lose himself, and he paused in indecision. At\nlast he arrived, by dint of feeling his way inch by inch, at a clearing\nwhere there was a great heap of whitish stones. He stepped up briskly to\nthese stones, and examined them attentively through the mists of night,\nas though he were passing them in review. A large tree, covered with\nthose excrescences which are the warts of vegetation, stood a few paces\ndistant from the pile of stones. He went up to this tree and passed\nhis hand over the bark of the trunk, as though seeking to recognize and\ncount all the warts.\n\nOpposite this tree, which was an ash, there was a chestnut-tree,\nsuffering from a peeling of the bark, to which a band of zinc had been\nnailed by way of dressing. He raised himself on tiptoe and touched this\nband of zinc.\n\nThen he trod about for awhile on the ground comprised in the space\nbetween the tree and the heap of stones, like a person who is trying to\nassure himself that the soil has not recently been disturbed.\n\nThat done, he took his bearings, and resumed his march through the\nforest.\n\nIt was the man who had just met Cosette.\n\nAs he walked through the thicket in the direction of Montfermeil, he had\nespied that tiny shadow moving with a groan, depositing a burden on\nthe ground, then taking it up and setting out again. He drew near, and\nperceived that it was a very young child, laden with an enormous bucket\nof water. Then he approached the child, and silently grasped the handle\nof the bucket.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII--COSETTE SIDE BY SIDE WITH THE STRANGER IN THE DARK\n\nCosette, as we have said, was not frightened.\n\nThe man accosted her. He spoke in a voice that was grave and almost\nbass.\n\n\"My child, what you are carrying is very heavy for you.\"\n\nCosette raised her head and replied:--\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"Give it to me,\" said the man; \"I will carry it for you.\"\n\nCosette let go of the bucket-handle. The man walked along beside her.\n\n\"It really is very heavy,\" he muttered between his teeth. Then he\nadded:--\n\n\"How old are you, little one?\"\n\n\"Eight, sir.\"\n\n\"And have you come from far like this?\"\n\n\"From the spring in the forest.\"\n\n\"Are you going far?\"\n\n\"A good quarter of an hour's walk from here.\"\n\nThe man said nothing for a moment; then he remarked abruptly:--\n\n\"So you have no mother.\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" answered the child.\n\nBefore the man had time to speak again, she added:--\n\n\"I don't think so. Other people have mothers. I have none.\"\n\nAnd after a silence she went on:--\n\n\"I think that I never had any.\"\n\nThe man halted; he set the bucket on the ground, bent down and placed\nboth hands on the child's shoulders, making an effort to look at her and\nto see her face in the dark.\n\nCosette's thin and sickly face was vaguely outlined by the livid light\nin the sky.\n\n\"What is your name?\" said the man.\n\n\"Cosette.\"\n\nThe man seemed to have received an electric shock. He looked at her once\nmore; then he removed his hands from Cosette's shoulders, seized the\nbucket, and set out again.\n\nAfter a moment he inquired:--\n\n\"Where do you live, little one?\"\n\n\"At Montfermeil, if you know where that is.\"\n\n\"That is where we are going?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\nHe paused; then began again:--\n\n\"Who sent you at such an hour to get water in the forest?\"\n\n\"It was Madame Thenardier.\"\n\nThe man resumed, in a voice which he strove to render indifferent, but\nin which there was, nevertheless, a singular tremor:--\n\n\"What does your Madame Thenardier do?\"\n\n\"She is my mistress,\" said the child. \"She keeps the inn.\"\n\n\"The inn?\" said the man. \"Well, I am going to lodge there to-night. Show\nme the way.\"\n\n\"We are on the way there,\" said the child.\n\nThe man walked tolerably fast. Cosette followed him without difficulty.\nShe no longer felt any fatigue. From time to time she raised her eyes\ntowards the man, with a sort of tranquillity and an indescribable\nconfidence. She had never been taught to turn to Providence and to pray;\nnevertheless, she felt within her something which resembled hope and\njoy, and which mounted towards heaven.\n\nSeveral minutes elapsed. The man resumed:--\n\n\"Is there no servant in Madame Thenardier's house?\"\n\n\"No, sir.\"\n\n\"Are you alone there?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\nAnother pause ensued. Cosette lifted up her voice:--\n\n\"That is to say, there are two little girls.\"\n\n\"What little girls?\"\n\n\"Ponine and Zelma.\"\n\nThis was the way the child simplified the romantic names so dear to the\nfemale Thenardier.\n\n\"Who are Ponine and Zelma?\"\n\n\"They are Madame Thenardier's young ladies; her daughters, as you would\nsay.\"\n\n\"And what do those girls do?\"\n\n\"Oh!\" said the child, \"they have beautiful dolls; things with gold in\nthem, all full of affairs. They play; they amuse themselves.\"\n\n\"All day long?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"And you?\"\n\n\"I? I work.\"\n\n\"All day long?\"\n\nThe child raised her great eyes, in which hung a tear, which was not\nvisible because of the darkness, and replied gently:--\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\nAfter an interval of silence she went on:--\n\n\"Sometimes, when I have finished my work and they let me, I amuse\nmyself, too.\"\n\n\"How do you amuse yourself?\"\n\n\"In the best way I can. They let me alone; but I have not many\nplaythings. Ponine and Zelma will not let me play with their dolls. I\nhave only a little lead sword, no longer than that.\"\n\nThe child held up her tiny finger.\n\n\"And it will not cut?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" said the child; \"it cuts salad and the heads of flies.\"\n\nThey reached the village. Cosette guided the stranger through the\nstreets. They passed the bakeshop, but Cosette did not think of the\nbread which she had been ordered to fetch. The man had ceased to ply her\nwith questions, and now preserved a gloomy silence.\n\nWhen they had left the church behind them, the man, on perceiving all\nthe open-air booths, asked Cosette:--\n\n\"So there is a fair going on here?\"\n\n\"No, sir; it is Christmas.\"\n\nAs they approached the tavern, Cosette timidly touched his arm:--\n\n\"Monsieur?\"\n\n\"What, my child?\"\n\n\"We are quite near the house.\"\n\n\"Well?\"\n\n\"Will you let me take my bucket now?\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"If Madame sees that some one has carried it for me, she will beat me.\"\n\nThe man handed her the bucket. An instant later they were at the tavern\ndoor.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII--THE UNPLEASANTNESS OF RECEIVING INTO ONE'S HOUSE A POOR\nMAN WHO MAY BE A RICH MAN\n\n\nCosette could not refrain from casting a sidelong glance at the big\ndoll, which was still displayed at the toy-merchant's; then she knocked.\nThe door opened. The Thenardier appeared with a candle in her hand.\n\n\n\"Ah! so it's you, you little wretch! good mercy, but you've taken your\ntime! The hussy has been amusing herself!\"\n\n\"Madame,\" said Cosette, trembling all over, \"here's a gentleman who\nwants a lodging.\"\n\nThe Thenardier speedily replaced her gruff air by her amiable grimace,\na change of aspect common to tavern-keepers, and eagerly sought the\nnew-comer with her eyes.\n\n\"This is the gentleman?\" said she.\n\n\"Yes, Madame,\" replied the man, raising his hand to his hat.\n\nWealthy travellers are not so polite. This gesture, and an inspection\nof the stranger's costume and baggage, which the Thenardier passed in\nreview with one glance, caused the amiable grimace to vanish, and the\ngruff mien to reappear. She resumed dryly:--\n\n\"Enter, my good man.\"\n\nThe \"good man\" entered. The Thenardier cast a second glance at him, paid\nparticular attention to his frock-coat, which was absolutely threadbare,\nand to his hat, which was a little battered, and, tossing her head,\nwrinkling her nose, and screwing up her eyes, she consulted her husband,\nwho was still drinking with the carters. The husband replied by that\nimperceptible movement of the forefinger, which, backed up by an\ninflation of the lips, signifies in such cases: A regular beggar.\nThereupon, the Thenardier exclaimed:--\n\n\"Ah! see here, my good man; I am very sorry, but I have no room left.\"\n\n\"Put me where you like,\" said the man; \"in the attic, in the stable. I\nwill pay as though I occupied a room.\"\n\n\"Forty sous.\"\n\n\"Forty sous; agreed.\"\n\n\"Very well, then!\"\n\n\"Forty sous!\" said a carter, in a low tone, to the Thenardier woman;\n\"why, the charge is only twenty sous!\"\n\n\"It is forty in his case,\" retorted the Thenardier, in the same tone. \"I\ndon't lodge poor folks for less.\"\n\n\"That's true,\" added her husband, gently; \"it ruins a house to have such\npeople in it.\"\n\nIn the meantime, the man, laying his bundle and his cudgel on a bench,\nhad seated himself at a table, on which Cosette made haste to place a\nbottle of wine and a glass. The merchant who had demanded the bucket of\nwater took it to his horse himself. Cosette resumed her place under the\nkitchen table, and her knitting.\n\nThe man, who had barely moistened his lips in the wine which he had\npoured out for himself, observed the child with peculiar attention.\n\nCosette was ugly. If she had been happy, she might have been pretty. We\nhave already given a sketch of that sombre little figure. Cosette was\nthin and pale; she was nearly eight years old, but she seemed to be\nhardly six. Her large eyes, sunken in a sort of shadow, were almost put\nout with weeping. The corners of her mouth had that curve of habitual\nanguish which is seen in condemned persons and desperately sick people.\nHer hands were, as her mother had divined, \"ruined with chilblains.\" The\nfire which illuminated her at that moment brought into relief all the\nangles of her bones, and rendered her thinness frightfully apparent.\nAs she was always shivering, she had acquired the habit of pressing her\nknees one against the other. Her entire clothing was but a rag which\nwould have inspired pity in summer, and which inspired horror in winter.\nAll she had on was hole-ridden linen, not a scrap of woollen. Her skin\nwas visible here and there and everywhere black and blue spots could be\ndescried, which marked the places where the Thenardier woman had touched\nher. Her naked legs were thin and red. The hollows in her neck were\nenough to make one weep. This child's whole person, her mien, her\nattitude, the sound of her voice, the intervals which she allowed to\nelapse between one word and the next, her glance, her silence, her\nslightest gesture, expressed and betrayed one sole idea,--fear.\n\nFear was diffused all over her; she was covered with it, so to speak;\nfear drew her elbows close to her hips, withdrew her heels under her\npetticoat, made her occupy as little space as possible, allowed her only\nthe breath that was absolutely necessary, and had become what might be\ncalled the habit of her body, admitting of no possible variation except\nan increase. In the depths of her eyes there was an astonished nook\nwhere terror lurked.\n\nHer fear was such, that on her arrival, wet as she was, Cosette did not\ndare to approach the fire and dry herself, but sat silently down to her\nwork again.\n\nThe expression in the glance of that child of eight years was habitually\nso gloomy, and at times so tragic, that it seemed at certain moments as\nthough she were on the verge of becoming an idiot or a demon.\n\nAs we have stated, she had never known what it is to pray; she had never\nset foot in a church. \"Have I the time?\" said the Thenardier.\n\nThe man in the yellow coat never took his eyes from Cosette.\n\nAll at once, the Thenardier exclaimed:--\n\n\"By the way, where's that bread?\"\n\nCosette, according to her custom whenever the Thenardier uplifted her\nvoice, emerged with great haste from beneath the table.\n\nShe had completely forgotten the bread. She had recourse to the\nexpedient of children who live in a constant state of fear. She lied.\n\n\"Madame, the baker's shop was shut.\"\n\n\"You should have knocked.\"\n\n\"I did knock, Madame.\"\n\n\"Well?\"\n\n\"He did not open the door.\"\n\n\"I'll find out to-morrow whether that is true,\" said the Thenardier;\n\"and if you are telling me a lie, I'll lead you a pretty dance. In the\nmeantime, give me back my fifteen-sou piece.\"\n\nCosette plunged her hand into the pocket of her apron, and turned green.\nThe fifteen-sou piece was not there.\n\n\"Ah, come now,\" said Madame Thenardier, \"did you hear me?\"\n\nCosette turned her pocket inside out; there was nothing in it. What\ncould have become of that money? The unhappy little creature could not\nfind a word to say. She was petrified.\n\n\"Have you lost that fifteen-sou piece?\" screamed the Thenardier,\nhoarsely, \"or do you want to rob me of it?\"\n\nAt the same time, she stretched out her arm towards the\ncat-o'-nine-tails which hung on a nail in the chimney-corner.\n\nThis formidable gesture restored to Cosette sufficient strength to\nshriek:--\n\n\"Mercy, Madame, Madame! I will not do so any more!\"\n\nThe Thenardier took down the whip.\n\nIn the meantime, the man in the yellow coat had been fumbling in the fob\nof his waistcoat, without any one having noticed his movements. Besides,\nthe other travellers were drinking or playing cards, and were not paying\nattention to anything.\n\nCosette contracted herself into a ball, with anguish, within the angle\nof the chimney, endeavoring to gather up and conceal her poor half-nude\nlimbs. The Thenardier raised her arm.\n\n\"Pardon me, Madame,\" said the man, \"but just now I caught sight of\nsomething which had fallen from this little one's apron pocket, and\nrolled aside. Perhaps this is it.\"\n\nAt the same time he bent down and seemed to be searching on the floor\nfor a moment.\n\n\"Exactly; here it is,\" he went on, straightening himself up.\n\nAnd he held out a silver coin to the Thenardier.\n\n\"Yes, that's it,\" said she.\n\nIt was not it, for it was a twenty-sou piece; but the Thenardier found\nit to her advantage. She put the coin in her pocket, and confined\nherself to casting a fierce glance at the child, accompanied with the\nremark, \"Don't let this ever happen again!\"\n\nCosette returned to what the Thenardier called \"her kennel,\" and her\nlarge eyes, which were riveted on the traveller, began to take on an\nexpression such as they had never worn before. Thus far it was only an\ninnocent amazement, but a sort of stupefied confidence was mingled with\nit.\n\n\"By the way, would you like some supper?\" the Thenardier inquired of the\ntraveller.\n\nHe made no reply. He appeared to be absorbed in thought.\n\n\"What sort of a man is that?\" she muttered between her teeth. \"He's some\nfrightfully poor wretch. He hasn't a sou to pay for a supper. Will he\neven pay me for his lodging? It's very lucky, all the same, that it did\nnot occur to him to steal the money that was on the floor.\"\n\nIn the meantime, a door had opened, and Eponine and Azelma entered.\n\nThey were two really pretty little girls, more bourgeois than peasant\nin looks, and very charming; the one with shining chestnut tresses,\nthe other with long black braids hanging down her back, both vivacious,\nneat, plump, rosy, and healthy, and a delight to the eye. They were\nwarmly clad, but with so much maternal art that the thickness of the\nstuffs did not detract from the coquetry of arrangement. There was a\nhint of winter, though the springtime was not wholly effaced. Light\nemanated from these two little beings. Besides this, they were on the\nthrone. In their toilettes, in their gayety, in the noise which they\nmade, there was sovereignty. When they entered, the Thenardier said to\nthem in a grumbling tone which was full of adoration, \"Ah! there you\nare, you children!\"\n\nThen drawing them, one after the other to her knees, smoothing their\nhair, tying their ribbons afresh, and then releasing them with\nthat gentle manner of shaking off which is peculiar to mothers, she\nexclaimed, \"What frights they are!\"\n\nThey went and seated themselves in the chimney-corner. They had a doll,\nwhich they turned over and over on their knees with all sorts of joyous\nchatter. From time to time Cosette raised her eyes from her knitting,\nand watched their play with a melancholy air.\n\nEponine and Azelma did not look at Cosette. She was the same as a dog\nto them. These three little girls did not yet reckon up four and twenty\nyears between them, but they already represented the whole society of\nman; envy on the one side, disdain on the other.\n\nThe doll of the Thenardier sisters was very much faded, very old, and\nmuch broken; but it seemed none the less admirable to Cosette, who had\nnever had a doll in her life, a real doll, to make use of the expression\nwhich all children will understand.\n\nAll at once, the Thenardier, who had been going back and forth in the\nroom, perceived that Cosette's mind was distracted, and that, instead of\nworking, she was paying attention to the little ones at their play.\n\n\"Ah! I've caught you at it!\" she cried. \"So that's the way you work!\nI'll make you work to the tune of the whip; that I will.\"\n\nThe stranger turned to the Thenardier, without quitting his chair.\n\n\"Bah, Madame,\" he said, with an almost timid air, \"let her play!\"\n\nSuch a wish expressed by a traveller who had eaten a slice of mutton and\nhad drunk a couple of bottles of wine with his supper, and who had not\nthe air of being frightfully poor, would have been equivalent to an\norder. But that a man with such a hat should permit himself such a\ndesire, and that a man with such a coat should permit himself to have a\nwill, was something which Madame Thenardier did not intend to tolerate.\nShe retorted with acrimony:--\n\n\"She must work, since she eats. I don't feed her to do nothing.\"\n\n\"What is she making?\" went on the stranger, in a gentle voice which\ncontrasted strangely with his beggarly garments and his porter's\nshoulders.\n\nThe Thenardier deigned to reply:--\n\n\"Stockings, if you please. Stockings for my little girls, who have none,\nso to speak, and who are absolutely barefoot just now.\"\n\nThe man looked at Cosette's poor little red feet, and continued:--\n\n\"When will she have finished this pair of stockings?\"\n\n\"She has at least three or four good days' work on them still, the lazy\ncreature!\"\n\n\"And how much will that pair of stockings be worth when she has finished\nthem?\"\n\nThe Thenardier cast a glance of disdain on him.\n\n\"Thirty sous at least.\"\n\n\"Will you sell them for five francs?\" went on the man.\n\n\"Good heavens!\" exclaimed a carter who was listening, with a loud laugh;\n\"five francs! the deuce, I should think so! five balls!\"\n\nThenardier thought it time to strike in.\n\n\"Yes, sir; if such is your fancy, you will be allowed to have that pair\nof stockings for five francs. We can refuse nothing to travellers.\"\n\n\"You must pay on the spot,\" said the Thenardier, in her curt and\nperemptory fashion.\n\n\"I will buy that pair of stockings,\" replied the man, \"and,\" he added,\ndrawing a five-franc piece from his pocket, and laying it on the table,\n\"I will pay for them.\"\n\nThen he turned to Cosette.\n\n\"Now I own your work; play, my child.\"\n\nThe carter was so much touched by the five-franc piece, that he\nabandoned his glass and hastened up.\n\n\"But it's true!\" he cried, examining it. \"A real hind wheel! and not\ncounterfeit!\"\n\nThenardier approached and silently put the coin in his pocket.\n\nThe Thenardier had no reply to make. She bit her lips, and her face\nassumed an expression of hatred.\n\nIn the meantime, Cosette was trembling. She ventured to ask:--\n\n\"Is it true, Madame? May I play?\"\n\n\"Play!\" said the Thenardier, in a terrible voice.\n\n\"Thanks, Madame,\" said Cosette.\n\nAnd while her mouth thanked the Thenardier, her whole little soul\nthanked the traveller.\n\nThenardier had resumed his drinking; his wife whispered in his ear:--\n\n\"Who can this yellow man be?\"\n\n\"I have seen millionaires with coats like that,\" replied Thenardier, in\na sovereign manner.\n\nCosette had dropped her knitting, but had not left her seat. Cosette\nalways moved as little as possible. She picked up some old rags and her\nlittle lead sword from a box behind her.\n\nEponine and Azelma paid no attention to what was going on. They had just\nexecuted a very important operation; they had just got hold of the\ncat. They had thrown their doll on the ground, and Eponine, who was\nthe elder, was swathing the little cat, in spite of its mewing and its\ncontortions, in a quantity of clothes and red and blue scraps. While\nperforming this serious and difficult work she was saying to her sister\nin that sweet and adorable language of children, whose grace, like the\nsplendor of the butterfly's wing, vanishes when one essays to fix it\nfast.\n\n\"You see, sister, this doll is more amusing than the other. She twists,\nshe cries, she is warm. See, sister, let us play with her. She shall be\nmy little girl. I will be a lady. I will come to see you, and you shall\nlook at her. Gradually, you will perceive her whiskers, and that will\nsurprise you. And then you will see her ears, and then you will see her\ntail and it will amaze you. And you will say to me, 'Ah! Mon Dieu!' and\nI will say to you: 'Yes, Madame, it is my little girl. Little girls are\nmade like that just at present.'\"\n\nAzelma listened admiringly to Eponine.\n\nIn the meantime, the drinkers had begun to sing an obscene song, and\nto laugh at it until the ceiling shook. Thenardier accompanied and\nencouraged them.\n\nAs birds make nests out of everything, so children make a doll out of\nanything which comes to hand. While Eponine and Azelma were bundling up\nthe cat, Cosette, on her side, had dressed up her sword. That done, she\nlaid it in her arms, and sang to it softly, to lull it to sleep.\n\nThe doll is one of the most imperious needs and, at the same time, one\nof the most charming instincts of feminine childhood. To care for, to\nclothe, to deck, to dress, to undress, to redress, to teach, scold a\nlittle, to rock, to dandle, to lull to sleep, to imagine that something\nis some one,--therein lies the whole woman's future. While dreaming and\nchattering, making tiny outfits, and baby clothes, while sewing little\ngowns, and corsages and bodices, the child grows into a young girl, the\nyoung girl into a big girl, the big girl into a woman. The first child\nis the continuation of the last doll.\n\nA little girl without a doll is almost as unhappy, and quite as\nimpossible, as a woman without children.\n\nSo Cosette had made herself a doll out of the sword.\n\nMadame Thenardier approached the yellow man; \"My husband is right,\" she\nthought; \"perhaps it is M. Laffitte; there are such queer rich men!\"\n\nShe came and set her elbows on the table.\n\n\"Monsieur,\" said she. At this word, Monsieur, the man turned; up to that\ntime, the Thenardier had addressed him only as brave homme or bonhomme.\n\n\"You see, sir,\" she pursued, assuming a sweetish air that was even more\nrepulsive to behold than her fierce mien, \"I am willing that the child\nshould play; I do not oppose it, but it is good for once, because you\nare generous. You see, she has nothing; she must needs work.\"\n\n\"Then this child is not yours?\" demanded the man.\n\n\"Oh! mon Dieu! no, sir! she is a little beggar whom we have taken in\nthrough charity; a sort of imbecile child. She must have water on the\nbrain; she has a large head, as you see. We do what we can for her, for\nwe are not rich; we have written in vain to her native place, and have\nreceived no reply these six months. It must be that her mother is dead.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" said the man, and fell into his revery once more.\n\n\"Her mother didn't amount to much,\" added the Thenardier; \"she abandoned\nher child.\"\n\nDuring the whole of this conversation Cosette, as though warned by some\ninstinct that she was under discussion, had not taken her eyes from the\nThenardier's face; she listened vaguely; she caught a few words here and\nthere.\n\nMeanwhile, the drinkers, all three-quarters intoxicated, were repeating\ntheir unclean refrain with redoubled gayety; it was a highly spiced and\nwanton song, in which the Virgin and the infant Jesus were introduced.\nThe Thenardier went off to take part in the shouts of laughter. Cosette,\nfrom her post under the table, gazed at the fire, which was reflected\nfrom her fixed eyes. She had begun to rock the sort of baby which she\nhad made, and, as she rocked it, she sang in a low voice, \"My mother is\ndead! my mother is dead! my mother is dead!\"\n\nOn being urged afresh by the hostess, the yellow man, \"the millionaire,\"\nconsented at last to take supper.\n\n\"What does Monsieur wish?\"\n\n\"Bread and cheese,\" said the man.\n\n\"Decidedly, he is a beggar\" thought Madame Thenardier.\n\nThe drunken men were still singing their song, and the child under the\ntable was singing hers.\n\nAll at once, Cosette paused; she had just turned round and caught sight\nof the little Thenardiers' doll, which they had abandoned for the cat\nand had left on the floor a few paces from the kitchen table.\n\nThen she dropped the swaddled sword, which only half met her needs, and\ncast her eyes slowly round the room. Madame Thenardier was whispering to\nher husband and counting over some money; Ponine and Zelma were playing\nwith the cat; the travellers were eating or drinking or singing; not\na glance was fixed on her. She had not a moment to lose; she crept out\nfrom under the table on her hands and knees, made sure once more that no\none was watching her; then she slipped quickly up to the doll and seized\nit. An instant later she was in her place again, seated motionless, and\nonly turned so as to cast a shadow on the doll which she held in her\narms. The happiness of playing with a doll was so rare for her that it\ncontained all the violence of voluptuousness.\n\nNo one had seen her, except the traveller, who was slowly devouring his\nmeagre supper.\n\nThis joy lasted about a quarter of an hour.\n\nBut with all the precautions that Cosette had taken she did not perceive\nthat one of the doll's legs stuck out and that the fire on the hearth\nlighted it up very vividly. That pink and shining foot, projecting from\nthe shadow, suddenly struck the eye of Azelma, who said to Eponine,\n\"Look! sister.\"\n\nThe two little girls paused in stupefaction; Cosette had dared to take\ntheir doll!\n\nEponine rose, and, without releasing the cat, she ran to her mother, and\nbegan to tug at her skirt.\n\n\"Let me alone!\" said her mother; \"what do you want?\"\n\n\"Mother,\" said the child, \"look there!\"\n\nAnd she pointed to Cosette.\n\nCosette, absorbed in the ecstasies of possession, no longer saw or heard\nanything.\n\nMadame Thenardier's countenance assumed that peculiar expression which\nis composed of the terrible mingled with the trifles of life, and which\nhas caused this style of woman to be named megaeras.\n\nOn this occasion, wounded pride exasperated her wrath still further.\nCosette had overstepped all bounds; Cosette had laid violent hands on\nthe doll belonging to \"these young ladies.\" A czarina who should see\na muzhik trying on her imperial son's blue ribbon would wear no other\nface.\n\nShe shrieked in a voice rendered hoarse with indignation:--\n\n\"Cosette!\"\n\nCosette started as though the earth had trembled beneath her; she turned\nround.\n\n\"Cosette!\" repeated the Thenardier.\n\nCosette took the doll and laid it gently on the floor with a sort of\nveneration, mingled with despair; then, without taking her eyes from\nit, she clasped her hands, and, what is terrible to relate of a child\nof that age, she wrung them; then--not one of the emotions of the day,\nneither the trip to the forest, nor the weight of the bucket of water,\nnor the loss of the money, nor the sight of the whip, nor even the sad\nwords which she had heard Madame Thenardier utter had been able to wring\nthis from her--she wept; she burst out sobbing.\n\nMeanwhile, the traveller had risen to his feet.\n\n\"What is the matter?\" he said to the Thenardier.\n\n\"Don't you see?\" said the Thenardier, pointing to the corpus delicti\nwhich lay at Cosette's feet.\n\n\"Well, what of it?\" resumed the man.\n\n\"That beggar,\" replied the Thenardier, \"has permitted herself to touch\nthe children's doll!\"\n\n\"All this noise for that!\" said the man; \"well, what if she did play\nwith that doll?\"\n\n\"She touched it with her dirty hands!\" pursued the Thenardier, \"with her\nfrightful hands!\"\n\nHere Cosette redoubled her sobs.\n\n\"Will you stop your noise?\" screamed the Thenardier.\n\nThe man went straight to the street door, opened it, and stepped out.\n\nAs soon as he had gone, the Thenardier profited by his absence to give\nCosette a hearty kick under the table, which made the child utter loud\ncries.\n\nThe door opened again, the man re-appeared; he carried in both hands the\nfabulous doll which we have mentioned, and which all the village brats\nhad been staring at ever since the morning, and he set it upright in\nfront of Cosette, saying:--\n\n\"Here; this is for you.\"\n\nIt must be supposed that in the course of the hour and more which he had\nspent there he had taken confused notice through his revery of that\ntoy shop, lighted up by fire-pots and candles so splendidly that it was\nvisible like an illumination through the window of the drinking-shop.\n\nCosette raised her eyes; she gazed at the man approaching her with that\ndoll as she might have gazed at the sun; she heard the unprecedented\nwords, \"It is for you\"; she stared at him; she stared at the doll; then\nshe slowly retreated, and hid herself at the extreme end, under the\ntable in a corner of the wall.\n\nShe no longer cried; she no longer wept; she had the appearance of no\nlonger daring to breathe.\n\nThe Thenardier, Eponine, and Azelma were like statues also; the very\ndrinkers had paused; a solemn silence reigned through the whole room.\n\nMadame Thenardier, petrified and mute, recommenced her conjectures: \"Who\nis that old fellow? Is he a poor man? Is he a millionaire? Perhaps he is\nboth; that is to say, a thief.\"\n\nThe face of the male Thenardier presented that expressive fold which\naccentuates the human countenance whenever the dominant instinct appears\nthere in all its bestial force. The tavern-keeper stared alternately at\nthe doll and at the traveller; he seemed to be scenting out the man, as\nhe would have scented out a bag of money. This did not last longer than\nthe space of a flash of lightning. He stepped up to his wife and said to\nher in a low voice:--\n\n\"That machine costs at least thirty francs. No nonsense. Down on your\nbelly before that man!\"\n\nGross natures have this in common with naive natures, that they possess\nno transition state.\n\n\"Well, Cosette,\" said the Thenardier, in a voice that strove to be\nsweet, and which was composed of the bitter honey of malicious women,\n\"aren't you going to take your doll?\"\n\nCosette ventured to emerge from her hole.\n\n\"The gentleman has given you a doll, my little Cosette,\" said\nThenardier, with a caressing air. \"Take it; it is yours.\"\n\nCosette gazed at the marvellous doll in a sort of terror. Her face was\nstill flooded with tears, but her eyes began to fill, like the sky at\ndaybreak, with strange beams of joy. What she felt at that moment was\na little like what she would have felt if she had been abruptly told,\n\"Little one, you are the Queen of France.\"\n\nIt seemed to her that if she touched that doll, lightning would dart\nfrom it.\n\nThis was true, up to a certain point, for she said to herself that the\nThenardier would scold and beat her.\n\nNevertheless, the attraction carried the day. She ended by drawing near\nand murmuring timidly as she turned towards Madame Thenardier:--\n\n\"May I, Madame?\"\n\nNo words can render that air, at once despairing, terrified, and\necstatic.\n\n\"Pardi!\" cried the Thenardier, \"it is yours. The gentleman has given it\nto you.\"\n\n\"Truly, sir?\" said Cosette. \"Is it true? Is the 'lady' mine?\"\n\nThe stranger's eyes seemed to be full of tears. He appeared to have\nreached that point of emotion where a man does not speak for fear lest\nhe should weep. He nodded to Cosette, and placed the \"lady's\" hand in\nher tiny hand.\n\nCosette hastily withdrew her hand, as though that of the \"lady\" scorched\nher, and began to stare at the floor. We are forced to add that at that\nmoment she stuck out her tongue immoderately. All at once she wheeled\nround and seized the doll in a transport.\n\n\"I shall call her Catherine,\" she said.\n\nIt was an odd moment when Cosette's rags met and clasped the ribbons and\nfresh pink muslins of the doll.\n\n\"Madame,\" she resumed, \"may I put her on a chair?\"\n\n\"Yes, my child,\" replied the Thenardier.\n\nIt was now the turn of Eponine and Azelma to gaze at Cosette with envy.\n\nCosette placed Catherine on a chair, then seated herself on the floor\nin front of her, and remained motionless, without uttering a word, in an\nattitude of contemplation.\n\n\"Play, Cosette,\" said the stranger.\n\n\"Oh! I am playing,\" returned the child.\n\nThis stranger, this unknown individual, who had the air of a visit which\nProvidence was making on Cosette, was the person whom the Thenardier\nhated worse than any one in the world at that moment. However, it was\nnecessary to control herself. Habituated as she was to dissimulation\nthrough endeavoring to copy her husband in all his actions, these\nemotions were more than she could endure. She made haste to send her\ndaughters to bed, then she asked the man's permission to send Cosette\noff also; \"for she has worked hard all day,\" she added with a maternal\nair. Cosette went off to bed, carrying Catherine in her arms.\n\nFrom time to time the Thenardier went to the other end of the room where\nher husband was, to relieve her soul, as she said. She exchanged with\nher husband words which were all the more furious because she dared not\nutter them aloud.\n\n\"Old beast! What has he got in his belly, to come and upset us in this\nmanner! To want that little monster to play! to give away forty-franc\ndolls to a jade that I would sell for forty sous, so I would! A little\nmore and he will be saying Your Majesty to her, as though to the Duchess\nde Berry! Is there any sense in it? Is he mad, then, that mysterious old\nfellow?\"\n\n\"Why! it is perfectly simple,\" replied Thenardier, \"if that amuses him!\nIt amuses you to have the little one work; it amuses him to have her\nplay. He's all right. A traveller can do what he pleases when he pays\nfor it. If the old fellow is a philanthropist, what is that to you? If\nhe is an imbecile, it does not concern you. What are you worrying for,\nso long as he has money?\"\n\nThe language of a master, and the reasoning of an innkeeper, neither of\nwhich admitted of any reply.\n\nThe man had placed his elbows on the table, and resumed his thoughtful\nattitude. All the other travellers, both pedlers and carters, had\nwithdrawn a little, and had ceased singing. They were staring at him\nfrom a distance, with a sort of respectful awe. This poorly dressed\nman, who drew \"hind-wheels\" from his pocket with so much ease, and\nwho lavished gigantic dolls on dirty little brats in wooden shoes, was\ncertainly a magnificent fellow, and one to be feared.\n\nMany hours passed. The midnight mass was over, the chimes had ceased,\nthe drinkers had taken their departure, the drinking-shop was closed,\nthe public room was deserted, the fire extinct, the stranger still\nremained in the same place and the same attitude. From time to time he\nchanged the elbow on which he leaned. That was all; but he had not said\na word since Cosette had left the room.\n\nThe Thenardiers alone, out of politeness and curiosity, had remained in\nthe room.\n\n\"Is he going to pass the night in that fashion?\" grumbled the\nThenardier. When two o'clock in the morning struck, she declared herself\nvanquished, and said to her husband, \"I'm going to bed. Do as you like.\"\nHer husband seated himself at a table in the corner, lighted a candle,\nand began to read the Courrier Francais.\n\nA good hour passed thus. The worthy inn-keeper had perused the Courrier\nFrancais at least three times, from the date of the number to the\nprinter's name. The stranger did not stir.\n\nThenardier fidgeted, coughed, spit, blew his nose, and creaked his\nchair. Not a movement on the man's part. \"Is he asleep?\" thought\nThenardier. The man was not asleep, but nothing could arouse him.\n\nAt last Thenardier took off his cap, stepped gently up to him, and\nventured to say:--\n\n\"Is not Monsieur going to his repose?\"\n\nNot going to bed would have seemed to him excessive and familiar. To\nrepose smacked of luxury and respect. These words possess the mysterious\nand admirable property of swelling the bill on the following day. A\nchamber where one sleeps costs twenty sous; a chamber in which one\nreposes costs twenty francs.\n\n\"Well!\" said the stranger, \"you are right. Where is your stable?\"\n\n\"Sir!\" exclaimed Thenardier, with a smile, \"I will conduct you, sir.\"\n\nHe took the candle; the man picked up his bundle and cudgel, and\nThenardier conducted him to a chamber on the first floor, which was of\nrare splendor, all furnished in mahogany, with a low bedstead, curtained\nwith red calico.\n\n\"What is this?\" said the traveller.\n\n\"It is really our bridal chamber,\" said the tavern-keeper. \"My wife and\nI occupy another. This is only entered three or four times a year.\"\n\n\"I should have liked the stable quite as well,\" said the man, abruptly.\n\nThenardier pretended not to hear this unamiable remark.\n\nHe lighted two perfectly fresh wax candles which figured on the\nchimney-piece. A very good fire was flickering on the hearth.\n\nOn the chimney-piece, under a glass globe, stood a woman's head-dress in\nsilver wire and orange flowers.\n\n\"And what is this?\" resumed the stranger.\n\n\"That, sir,\" said Thenardier, \"is my wife's wedding bonnet.\"\n\nThe traveller surveyed the object with a glance which seemed to say,\n\"There really was a time, then, when that monster was a maiden?\"\n\nThenardier lied, however. When he had leased this paltry building for\nthe purpose of converting it into a tavern, he had found this chamber\ndecorated in just this manner, and had purchased the furniture and\nobtained the orange flowers at second hand, with the idea that this\nwould cast a graceful shadow on \"his spouse,\" and would result in what\nthe English call respectability for his house.\n\nWhen the traveller turned round, the host had disappeared. Thenardier\nhad withdrawn discreetly, without venturing to wish him a good night,\nas he did not wish to treat with disrespectful cordiality a man whom he\nproposed to fleece royally the following morning.\n\nThe inn-keeper retired to his room. His wife was in bed, but she was not\nasleep. When she heard her husband's step she turned over and said to\nhim:--\n\n\"Do you know, I'm going to turn Cosette out of doors to-morrow.\"\n\nThenardier replied coldly:--\n\n\"How you do go on!\"\n\nThey exchanged no further words, and a few moments later their candle\nwas extinguished.\n\nAs for the traveller, he had deposited his cudgel and his bundle in a\ncorner. The landlord once gone, he threw himself into an arm-chair and\nremained for some time buried in thought. Then he removed his shoes,\ntook one of the two candles, blew out the other, opened the door, and\nquitted the room, gazing about him like a person who is in search of\nsomething. He traversed a corridor and came upon a staircase. There he\nheard a very faint and gentle sound like the breathing of a child. He\nfollowed this sound, and came to a sort of triangular recess built under\nthe staircase, or rather formed by the staircase itself. This recess was\nnothing else than the space under the steps. There, in the midst of all\nsorts of old papers and potsherds, among dust and spiders' webs, was a\nbed--if one can call by the name of bed a straw pallet so full of holes\nas to display the straw, and a coverlet so tattered as to show the\npallet. No sheets. This was placed on the floor.\n\nIn this bed Cosette was sleeping.\n\nThe man approached and gazed down upon her.\n\nCosette was in a profound sleep; she was fully dressed. In the winter\nshe did not undress, in order that she might not be so cold.\n\nAgainst her breast was pressed the doll, whose large eyes, wide open,\nglittered in the dark. From time to time she gave vent to a deep sigh as\nthough she were on the point of waking, and she strained the doll almost\nconvulsively in her arms. Beside her bed there was only one of her\nwooden shoes.\n\nA door which stood open near Cosette's pallet permitted a view of a\nrather large, dark room. The stranger stepped into it. At the further\nextremity, through a glass door, he saw two small, very white beds.\nThey belonged to Eponine and Azelma. Behind these beds, and half hidden,\nstood an uncurtained wicker cradle, in which the little boy who had\ncried all the evening lay asleep.\n\nThe stranger conjectured that this chamber connected with that of the\nThenardier pair. He was on the point of retreating when his eye fell\nupon the fireplace--one of those vast tavern chimneys where there is\nalways so little fire when there is any fire at all, and which are\nso cold to look at. There was no fire in this one, there was not even\nashes; but there was something which attracted the stranger's gaze,\nnevertheless. It was two tiny children's shoes, coquettish in shape\nand unequal in size. The traveller recalled the graceful and immemorial\ncustom in accordance with which children place their shoes in the\nchimney on Christmas eve, there to await in the darkness some sparkling\ngift from their good fairy. Eponine and Azelma had taken care not to\nomit this, and each of them had set one of her shoes on the hearth.\n\nThe traveller bent over them.\n\nThe fairy, that is to say, their mother, had already paid her visit, and\nin each he saw a brand-new and shining ten-sou piece.\n\nThe man straightened himself up, and was on the point of withdrawing,\nwhen far in, in the darkest corner of the hearth, he caught sight\nof another object. He looked at it, and recognized a wooden shoe, a\nfrightful shoe of the coarsest description, half dilapidated and all\ncovered with ashes and dried mud. It was Cosette's sabot. Cosette, with\nthat touching trust of childhood, which can always be deceived yet never\ndiscouraged, had placed her shoe on the hearth-stone also.\n\nHope in a child who has never known anything but despair is a sweet and\ntouching thing.\n\nThere was nothing in this wooden shoe.\n\nThe stranger fumbled in his waistcoat, bent over and placed a louis d'or\nin Cosette's shoe.\n\nThen he regained his own chamber with the stealthy tread of a wolf.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX--THENARDIER AND HIS MANOEUVRES\n\nOn the following morning, two hours at least before day-break,\nThenardier, seated beside a candle in the public room of the tavern, pen\nin hand, was making out the bill for the traveller with the yellow coat.\n\nHis wife, standing beside him, and half bent over him, was following\nhim with her eyes. They exchanged not a word. On the one hand, there was\nprofound meditation, on the other, the religious admiration with which\none watches the birth and development of a marvel of the human mind. A\nnoise was audible in the house; it was the Lark sweeping the stairs.\n\nAfter the lapse of a good quarter of an hour, and some erasures,\nThenardier produced the following masterpiece:--\n\n          BILL OF THE GENTLEMAN IN No. 1.\n\n  Supper . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .     3 francs.\n  Chamber  . . . . . . . . . . . . . .    10   \"\n  Candle . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .     5   \"\n  Fire . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .     4   \"\n  Service  . . . . . . . . . . . . . .     1   \"\n                                          ----------\n                     Total . . . . . .    23 francs.\n\n\nService was written servisse.\n\n\"Twenty-three francs!\" cried the woman, with an enthusiasm which was\nmingled with some hesitation.\n\nLike all great artists, Thenardier was dissatisfied.\n\n\"Peuh!\" he exclaimed.\n\nIt was the accent of Castlereagh auditing France's bill at the Congress\nof Vienna.\n\n\"Monsieur Thenardier, you are right; he certainly owes that,\" murmured\nthe wife, who was thinking of the doll bestowed on Cosette in the\npresence of her daughters. \"It is just, but it is too much. He will not\npay it.\"\n\nThenardier laughed coldly, as usual, and said:--\n\n\"He will pay.\"\n\nThis laugh was the supreme assertion of certainty and authority. That\nwhich was asserted in this manner must needs be so. His wife did not\ninsist.\n\nShe set about arranging the table; her husband paced the room. A moment\nlater he added:--\n\n\"I owe full fifteen hundred francs!\"\n\nHe went and seated himself in the chimney-corner, meditating, with his\nfeet among the warm ashes.\n\n\"Ah! by the way,\" resumed his wife, \"you don't forget that I'm going to\nturn Cosette out of doors to-day? The monster! She breaks my heart with\nthat doll of hers! I'd rather marry Louis XVIII. than keep her another\nday in the house!\"\n\nThenardier lighted his pipe, and replied between two puffs:--\n\n\"You will hand that bill to the man.\"\n\nThen he went out.\n\nHardly had he left the room when the traveller entered.\n\nThenardier instantly reappeared behind him and remained motionless in\nthe half-open door, visible only to his wife.\n\nThe yellow man carried his bundle and his cudgel in his hand.\n\n\"Up so early?\" said Madame Thenardier; \"is Monsieur leaving us already?\"\n\nAs she spoke thus, she was twisting the bill about in her hands with an\nembarrassed air, and making creases in it with her nails. Her hard\nface presented a shade which was not habitual with it,--timidity and\nscruples.\n\nTo present such a bill to a man who had so completely the air \"of a poor\nwretch\" seemed difficult to her.\n\nThe traveller appeared to be preoccupied and absent-minded. He\nreplied:--\n\n\"Yes, Madame, I am going.\"\n\n\"So Monsieur has no business in Montfermeil?\"\n\n\"No, I was passing through. That is all. What do I owe you, Madame,\" he\nadded.\n\nThe Thenardier silently handed him the folded bill.\n\nThe man unfolded the paper and glanced at it; but his thoughts were\nevidently elsewhere.\n\n\"Madame,\" he resumed, \"is business good here in Montfermeil?\"\n\n\"So so, Monsieur,\" replied the Thenardier, stupefied at not witnessing\nanother sort of explosion.\n\nShe continued, in a dreary and lamentable tone:--\n\n\"Oh! Monsieur, times are so hard! and then, we have so few bourgeois in\nthe neighborhood! All the people are poor, you see. If we had not, now\nand then, some rich and generous travellers like Monsieur, we should\nnot get along at all. We have so many expenses. Just see, that child is\ncosting us our very eyes.\"\n\n\"What child?\"\n\n\"Why, the little one, you know! Cosette--the Lark, as she is called\nhereabouts!\"\n\n\"Ah!\" said the man.\n\nShe went on:--\n\n\"How stupid these peasants are with their nicknames! She has more the\nair of a bat than of a lark. You see, sir, we do not ask charity, and we\ncannot bestow it. We earn nothing and we have to pay out a great deal.\nThe license, the imposts, the door and window tax, the hundredths!\nMonsieur is aware that the government demands a terrible deal of money.\nAnd then, I have my daughters. I have no need to bring up other people's\nchildren.\"\n\nThe man resumed, in that voice which he strove to render indifferent,\nand in which there lingered a tremor:--\n\n\"What if one were to rid you of her?\"\n\n\"Who? Cosette?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nThe landlady's red and violent face brightened up hideously.\n\n\"Ah! sir, my dear sir, take her, keep her, lead her off, carry her\naway, sugar her, stuff her with truffles, drink her, eat her, and the\nblessings of the good holy Virgin and of all the saints of paradise be\nupon you!\"\n\n\"Agreed.\"\n\n\"Really! You will take her away?\"\n\n\"I will take her away.\"\n\n\"Immediately?\"\n\n\"Immediately. Call the child.\"\n\n\"Cosette!\" screamed the Thenardier.\n\n\"In the meantime,\" pursued the man, \"I will pay you what I owe you. How\nmuch is it?\"\n\nHe cast a glance on the bill, and could not restrain a start of\nsurprise:--\n\n\"Twenty-three francs!\"\n\nHe looked at the landlady, and repeated:--\n\n\"Twenty-three francs?\"\n\nThere was in the enunciation of these words, thus repeated, an accent\nbetween an exclamation and an interrogation point.\n\nThe Thenardier had had time to prepare herself for the shock. She\nreplied, with assurance:--\n\n\"Good gracious, yes, sir, it is twenty-three francs.\"\n\nThe stranger laid five five-franc pieces on the table.\n\n\"Go and get the child,\" said he.\n\nAt that moment Thenardier advanced to the middle of the room, and\nsaid:--\n\n\"Monsieur owes twenty-six sous.\"\n\n\"Twenty-six sous!\" exclaimed his wife.\n\n\"Twenty sous for the chamber,\" resumed Thenardier, coldly, \"and six sous\nfor his supper. As for the child, I must discuss that matter a little\nwith the gentleman. Leave us, wife.\"\n\nMadame Thenardier was dazzled as with the shock caused by unexpected\nlightning flashes of talent. She was conscious that a great actor was\nmaking his entrance on the stage, uttered not a word in reply, and left\nthe room.\n\nAs soon as they were alone, Thenardier offered the traveller a chair.\nThe traveller seated himself; Thenardier remained standing, and his face\nassumed a singular expression of good-fellowship and simplicity.\n\n\"Sir,\" said he, \"what I have to say to you is this, that I adore that\nchild.\"\n\nThe stranger gazed intently at him.\n\n\"What child?\"\n\nThenardier continued:--\n\n\"How strange it is, one grows attached. What money is that? Take back\nyour hundred-sou piece. I adore the child.\"\n\n\"Whom do you mean?\" demanded the stranger.\n\n\"Eh! our little Cosette! Are you not intending to take her away from\nus? Well, I speak frankly; as true as you are an honest man, I will not\nconsent to it. I shall miss that child. I saw her first when she was a\ntiny thing. It is true that she costs us money; it is true that she has\nher faults; it is true that we are not rich; it is true that I have paid\nout over four hundred francs for drugs for just one of her illnesses!\nBut one must do something for the good God's sake. She has neither\nfather nor mother. I have brought her up. I have bread enough for\nher and for myself. In truth, I think a great deal of that child. You\nunderstand, one conceives an affection for a person; I am a good sort\nof a beast, I am; I do not reason; I love that little girl; my wife is\nquick-tempered, but she loves her also. You see, she is just the same as\nour own child. I want to keep her to babble about the house.\"\n\nThe stranger kept his eye intently fixed on Thenardier. The latter\ncontinued:--\n\n\"Excuse me, sir, but one does not give away one's child to a passer-by,\nlike that. I am right, am I not? Still, I don't say--you are rich; you\nhave the air of a very good man,--if it were for her happiness. But one\nmust find out that. You understand: suppose that I were to let her go\nand to sacrifice myself, I should like to know what becomes of her; I\nshould not wish to lose sight of her; I should like to know with whom\nshe is living, so that I could go to see her from time to time; so that\nshe may know that her good foster-father is alive, that he is watching\nover her. In short, there are things which are not possible. I do not\neven know your name. If you were to take her away, I should say: 'Well,\nand the Lark, what has become of her?' One must, at least, see some\npetty scrap of paper, some trifle in the way of a passport, you know!\"\n\nThe stranger, still surveying him with that gaze which penetrates, as\nthe saying goes, to the very depths of the conscience, replied in a\ngrave, firm voice:--\n\n\"Monsieur Thenardier, one does not require a passport to travel five\nleagues from Paris. If I take Cosette away, I shall take her away, and\nthat is the end of the matter. You will not know my name, you will not\nknow my residence, you will not know where she is; and my intention is\nthat she shall never set eyes on you again so long as she lives. I break\nthe thread which binds her foot, and she departs. Does that suit you?\nYes or no?\"\n\nSince geniuses, like demons, recognize the presence of a superior God by\ncertain signs, Thenardier comprehended that he had to deal with a very\nstrong person. It was like an intuition; he comprehended it with his\nclear and sagacious promptitude. While drinking with the carters,\nsmoking, and singing coarse songs on the preceding evening, he had\ndevoted the whole of the time to observing the stranger, watching him\nlike a cat, and studying him like a mathematician. He had watched him,\nboth on his own account, for the pleasure of the thing, and through\ninstinct, and had spied upon him as though he had been paid for so\ndoing. Not a movement, not a gesture, on the part of the man in the\nyellow great-coat had escaped him. Even before the stranger had so\nclearly manifested his interest in Cosette, Thenardier had divined his\npurpose. He had caught the old man's deep glances returning constantly\nto the child. Who was this man? Why this interest? Why this hideous\ncostume, when he had so much money in his purse? Questions which he put\nto himself without being able to solve them, and which irritated him. He\nhad pondered it all night long. He could not be Cosette's father. Was he\nher grandfather? Then why not make himself known at once? When one has\na right, one asserts it. This man evidently had no right over Cosette.\nWhat was it, then? Thenardier lost himself in conjectures. He caught\nglimpses of everything, but he saw nothing. Be that as it may, on\nentering into conversation with the man, sure that there was some secret\nin the case, that the latter had some interest in remaining in the\nshadow, he felt himself strong; when he perceived from the stranger's\nclear and firm retort, that this mysterious personage was mysterious in\nso simple a way, he became conscious that he was weak. He had expected\nnothing of the sort. His conjectures were put to the rout. He rallied\nhis ideas. He weighed everything in the space of a second. Thenardier\nwas one of those men who take in a situation at a glance. He decided\nthat the moment had arrived for proceeding straightforward, and quickly\nat that. He did as great leaders do at the decisive moment, which they\nknow that they alone recognize; he abruptly unmasked his batteries.\n\n\"Sir,\" said he, \"I am in need of fifteen hundred francs.\"\n\nThe stranger took from his side pocket an old pocketbook of black\nleather, opened it, drew out three bank-bills, which he laid on the\ntable. Then he placed his large thumb on the notes and said to the\ninn-keeper:--\n\n\"Go and fetch Cosette.\"\n\nWhile this was taking place, what had Cosette been doing?\n\nOn waking up, Cosette had run to get her shoe. In it she had found the\ngold piece. It was not a Napoleon; it was one of those perfectly new\ntwenty-franc pieces of the Restoration, on whose effigy the little\nPrussian queue had replaced the laurel wreath. Cosette was dazzled. Her\ndestiny began to intoxicate her. She did not know what a gold piece was;\nshe had never seen one; she hid it quickly in her pocket, as though\nshe had stolen it. Still, she felt that it really was hers; she guessed\nwhence her gift had come, but the joy which she experienced was full of\nfear. She was happy; above all she was stupefied. Such magnificent and\nbeautiful things did not appear real. The doll frightened her, the\ngold piece frightened her. She trembled vaguely in the presence of this\nmagnificence. The stranger alone did not frighten her. On the contrary,\nhe reassured her. Ever since the preceding evening, amid all her\namazement, even in her sleep, she had been thinking in her little\nchildish mind of that man who seemed to be so poor and so sad, and who\nwas so rich and so kind. Everything had changed for her since she had\nmet that good man in the forest. Cosette, less happy than the most\ninsignificant swallow of heaven, had never known what it was to take\nrefuge under a mother's shadow and under a wing. For the last five\nyears, that is to say, as far back as her memory ran, the poor child had\nshivered and trembled. She had always been exposed completely naked\nto the sharp wind of adversity; now it seemed to her she was clothed.\nFormerly her soul had seemed cold, now it was warm. Cosette was no\nlonger afraid of the Thenardier. She was no longer alone; there was some\none there.\n\nShe hastily set about her regular morning duties. That louis, which she\nhad about her, in the very apron pocket whence the fifteen-sou piece had\nfallen on the night before, distracted her thoughts. She dared not touch\nit, but she spent five minutes in gazing at it, with her tongue hanging\nout, if the truth must be told. As she swept the staircase, she paused,\nremained standing there motionless, forgetful of her broom and of the\nentire universe, occupied in gazing at that star which was blazing at\nthe bottom of her pocket.\n\nIt was during one of these periods of contemplation that the Thenardier\njoined her. She had gone in search of Cosette at her husband's orders.\nWhat was quite unprecedented, she neither struck her nor said an\ninsulting word to her.\n\n\"Cosette,\" she said, almost gently, \"come immediately.\"\n\nAn instant later Cosette entered the public room.\n\nThe stranger took up the bundle which he had brought and untied it. This\nbundle contained a little woollen gown, an apron, a fustian bodice, a\nkerchief, a petticoat, woollen stockings, shoes--a complete outfit for a\ngirl of seven years. All was black.\n\n\"My child,\" said the man, \"take these, and go and dress yourself\nquickly.\"\n\nDaylight was appearing when those of the inhabitants of Montfermeil who\nhad begun to open their doors beheld a poorly clad old man leading a\nlittle girl dressed in mourning, and carrying a pink doll in her arms,\npass along the road to Paris. They were going in the direction of Livry.\n\nIt was our man and Cosette.\n\nNo one knew the man; as Cosette was no longer in rags, many did not\nrecognize her. Cosette was going away. With whom? She did not know.\nWhither? She knew not. All that she understood was that she was leaving\nthe Thenardier tavern behind her. No one had thought of bidding her\nfarewell, nor had she thought of taking leave of any one. She was\nleaving that hated and hating house.\n\nPoor, gentle creature, whose heart had been repressed up to that hour!\n\nCosette walked along gravely, with her large eyes wide open, and gazing\nat the sky. She had put her louis in the pocket of her new apron. From\ntime to time, she bent down and glanced at it; then she looked at the\ngood man. She felt something as though she were beside the good God.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X--HE WHO SEEKS TO BETTER HIMSELF MAY RENDER HIS SITUATION WORSE\n\nMadame Thenardier had allowed her husband to have his own way, as was\nher wont. She had expected great results. When the man and Cosette had\ntaken their departure, Thenardier allowed a full quarter of an hour\nto elapse; then he took her aside and showed her the fifteen hundred\nfrancs.\n\n\"Is that all?\" said she.\n\nIt was the first time since they had set up housekeeping that she had\ndared to criticise one of the master's acts.\n\nThe blow told.\n\n\"You are right, in sooth,\" said he; \"I am a fool. Give me my hat.\"\n\nHe folded up the three bank-bills, thrust them into his pocket, and ran\nout in all haste; but he made a mistake and turned to the right first.\nSome neighbors, of whom he made inquiries, put him on the track again;\nthe Lark and the man had been seen going in the direction of Livry. He\nfollowed these hints, walking with great strides, and talking to himself\nthe while:--\n\n\"That man is evidently a million dressed in yellow, and I am an animal.\nFirst he gave twenty sous, then five francs, then fifty francs, then\nfifteen hundred francs, all with equal readiness. He would have given\nfifteen thousand francs. But I shall overtake him.\"\n\nAnd then, that bundle of clothes prepared beforehand for the child; all\nthat was singular; many mysteries lay concealed under it. One does not\nlet mysteries out of one's hand when one has once grasped them. The\nsecrets of the wealthy are sponges of gold; one must know how to subject\nthem to pressure. All these thoughts whirled through his brain. \"I am an\nanimal,\" said he.\n\nWhen one leaves Montfermeil and reaches the turn which the road takes\nthat runs to Livry, it can be seen stretching out before one to a great\ndistance across the plateau. On arriving there, he calculated that he\nought to be able to see the old man and the child. He looked as far as\nhis vision reached, and saw nothing. He made fresh inquiries, but he had\nwasted time. Some passers-by informed him that the man and child of whom\nhe was in search had gone towards the forest in the direction of Gagny.\nHe hastened in that direction.\n\nThey were far in advance of him; but a child walks slowly, and he walked\nfast; and then, he was well acquainted with the country.\n\nAll at once he paused and dealt himself a blow on his forehead like a\nman who has forgotten some essential point and who is ready to retrace\nhis steps.\n\n\"I ought to have taken my gun,\" said he to himself.\n\nThenardier was one of those double natures which sometimes pass through\nour midst without our being aware of the fact, and who disappear without\nour finding them out, because destiny has only exhibited one side of\nthem. It is the fate of many men to live thus half submerged. In a\ncalm and even situation, Thenardier possessed all that is required to\nmake--we will not say to be--what people have agreed to call an honest\ntrader, a good bourgeois. At the same time certain circumstances being\ngiven, certain shocks arriving to bring his under-nature to the surface,\nhe had all the requisites for a blackguard. He was a shopkeeper in\nwhom there was some taint of the monster. Satan must have occasionally\ncrouched down in some corner of the hovel in which Thenardier dwelt, and\nhave fallen a-dreaming in the presence of this hideous masterpiece.\n\nAfter a momentary hesitation:--\n\n\"Bah!\" he thought; \"they will have time to make their escape.\"\n\nAnd he pursued his road, walking rapidly straight ahead, and with almost\nan air of certainty, with the sagacity of a fox scenting a covey of\npartridges.\n\nIn truth, when he had passed the ponds and had traversed in an oblique\ndirection the large clearing which lies on the right of the Avenue de\nBellevue, and reached that turf alley which nearly makes the circuit of\nthe hill, and covers the arch of the ancient aqueduct of the Abbey of\nChelles, he caught sight, over the top of the brushwood, of the hat on\nwhich he had already erected so many conjectures; it was that man's hat.\nThe brushwood was not high. Thenardier recognized the fact that the man\nand Cosette were sitting there. The child could not be seen on account\nof her small size, but the head of her doll was visible.\n\nThenardier was not mistaken. The man was sitting there, and letting\nCosette get somewhat rested. The inn-keeper walked round the brushwood\nand presented himself abruptly to the eyes of those whom he was in\nsearch of.\n\n\"Pardon, excuse me, sir,\" he said, quite breathless, \"but here are your\nfifteen hundred francs.\"\n\nSo saying, he handed the stranger the three bank-bills.\n\nThe man raised his eyes.\n\n\"What is the meaning of this?\"\n\nThenardier replied respectfully:--\n\n\"It means, sir, that I shall take back Cosette.\"\n\nCosette shuddered, and pressed close to the old man.\n\nHe replied, gazing to the very bottom of Thenardier's eyes the while,\nand enunciating every syllable distinctly:--\n\n\"You are go-ing to take back Co-sette?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir, I am. I will tell you; I have considered the matter. In fact,\nI have not the right to give her to you. I am an honest man, you see;\nthis child does not belong to me; she belongs to her mother. It was her\nmother who confided her to me; I can only resign her to her mother. You\nwill say to me, 'But her mother is dead.' Good; in that case I can only\ngive the child up to the person who shall bring me a writing, signed by\nher mother, to the effect that I am to hand the child over to the person\ntherein mentioned; that is clear.\"\n\nThe man, without making any reply, fumbled in his pocket, and Thenardier\nbeheld the pocket-book of bank-bills make its appearance once more.\n\nThe tavern-keeper shivered with joy.\n\n\"Good!\" thought he; \"let us hold firm; he is going to bribe me!\"\n\nBefore opening the pocket-book, the traveller cast a glance about him:\nthe spot was absolutely deserted; there was not a soul either in the\nwoods or in the valley. The man opened his pocket-book once more and\ndrew from it, not the handful of bills which Thenardier expected, but a\nsimple little paper, which he unfolded and presented fully open to the\ninn-keeper, saying:--\n\n\"You are right; read!\"\n\nThenardier took the paper and read:--\n\n                              \"M. SUR M., March 25, 1823.\n\n \"MONSIEUR THENARDIER:--\n\n               You will deliver Cosette to this person.\n               You will be paid for all the little things.\n               I have the honor to salute you with respect,\n                                                  FANTINE.\"\n\n\"You know that signature?\" resumed the man.\n\nIt certainly was Fantine's signature; Thenardier recognized it.\n\nThere was no reply to make; he experienced two violent vexations, the\nvexation of renouncing the bribery which he had hoped for, and the\nvexation of being beaten; the man added:--\n\n\"You may keep this paper as your receipt.\"\n\nThenardier retreated in tolerably good order.\n\n\"This signature is fairly well imitated,\" he growled between his teeth;\n\"however, let it go!\"\n\nThen he essayed a desperate effort.\n\n\"It is well, sir,\" he said, \"since you are the person, but I must be\npaid for all those little things. A great deal is owing to me.\"\n\nThe man rose to his feet, filliping the dust from his thread-bare\nsleeve:--\n\n\"Monsieur Thenardier, in January last, the mother reckoned that she owed\nyou one hundred and twenty francs. In February, you sent her a bill of\nfive hundred francs; you received three hundred francs at the end of\nFebruary, and three hundred francs at the beginning of March. Since then\nnine months have elapsed, at fifteen francs a month, the price agreed\nupon, which makes one hundred and thirty-five francs. You had received\none hundred francs too much; that makes thirty-five still owing you. I\nhave just given you fifteen hundred francs.\"\n\nThenardier's sensations were those of the wolf at the moment when he\nfeels himself nipped and seized by the steel jaw of the trap.\n\n\"Who is this devil of a man?\" he thought.\n\nHe did what the wolf does: he shook himself. Audacity had succeeded with\nhim once.\n\n\"Monsieur-I-don't-know-your-name,\" he said resolutely, and this time\ncasting aside all respectful ceremony, \"I shall take back Cosette if you\ndo not give me a thousand crowns.\"\n\nThe stranger said tranquilly:--\n\n\"Come, Cosette.\"\n\nHe took Cosette by his left hand, and with his right he picked up his\ncudgel, which was lying on the ground.\n\nThenardier noted the enormous size of the cudgel and the solitude of the\nspot.\n\nThe man plunged into the forest with the child, leaving the inn-keeper\nmotionless and speechless.\n\nWhile they were walking away, Thenardier scrutinized his huge shoulders,\nwhich were a little rounded, and his great fists.\n\nThen, bringing his eyes back to his own person, they fell upon his\nfeeble arms and his thin hands. \"I really must have been exceedingly\nstupid not to have thought to bring my gun,\" he said to himself, \"since\nI was going hunting!\"\n\nHowever, the inn-keeper did not give up.\n\n\"I want to know where he is going,\" said he, and he set out to follow\nthem at a distance. Two things were left on his hands, an irony in\nthe shape of the paper signed Fantine, and a consolation, the fifteen\nhundred francs.\n\nThe man led Cosette off in the direction of Livry and Bondy. He walked\nslowly, with drooping head, in an attitude of reflection and sadness.\nThe winter had thinned out the forest, so that Thenardier did not lose\nthem from sight, although he kept at a good distance. The man turned\nround from time to time, and looked to see if he was being followed.\nAll at once he caught sight of Thenardier. He plunged suddenly into\nthe brushwood with Cosette, where they could both hide themselves. \"The\ndeuce!\" said Thenardier, and he redoubled his pace.\n\nThe thickness of the undergrowth forced him to draw nearer to them. When\nthe man had reached the densest part of the thicket, he wheeled\nround. It was in vain that Thenardier sought to conceal himself in the\nbranches; he could not prevent the man seeing him. The man cast upon him\nan uneasy glance, then elevated his head and continued his course. The\ninn-keeper set out again in pursuit. Thus they continued for two or\nthree hundred paces. All at once the man turned round once more; he saw\nthe inn-keeper. This time he gazed at him with so sombre an air that\nThenardier decided that it was \"useless\" to proceed further. Thenardier\nretraced his steps.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI--NUMBER 9,430 REAPPEARS, AND COSETTE WINS IT IN THE LOTTERY\n\nJean Valjean was not dead.\n\nWhen he fell into the sea, or rather, when he threw himself into it, he\nwas not ironed, as we have seen. He swam under water until he reached a\nvessel at anchor, to which a boat was moored. He found means of hiding\nhimself in this boat until night. At night he swam off again, and\nreached the shore a little way from Cape Brun. There, as he did not lack\nmoney, he procured clothing. A small country-house in the neighborhood\nof Balaguier was at that time the dressing-room of escaped convicts,--a\nlucrative specialty. Then Jean Valjean, like all the sorry fugitives\nwho are seeking to evade the vigilance of the law and social fatality,\npursued an obscure and undulating itinerary. He found his first\nrefuge at Pradeaux, near Beausset. Then he directed his course towards\nGrand-Villard, near Briancon, in the Hautes-Alpes. It was a fumbling and\nuneasy flight,--a mole's track, whose branchings are untraceable. Later\non, some trace of his passage into Ain, in the territory of Civrieux,\nwas discovered; in the Pyrenees, at Accons; at the spot called\nGrange-de-Doumec, near the market of Chavailles, and in the environs of\nPerigueux at Brunies, canton of La Chapelle-Gonaguet. He reached Paris.\nWe have just seen him at Montfermeil.\n\nHis first care on arriving in Paris had been to buy mourning clothes\nfor a little girl of from seven to eight years of age; then to procure\na lodging. That done, he had betaken himself to Montfermeil. It will\nbe remembered that already, during his preceding escape, he had made a\nmysterious trip thither, or somewhere in that neighborhood, of which the\nlaw had gathered an inkling.\n\nHowever, he was thought to be dead, and this still further increased the\nobscurity which had gathered about him. At Paris, one of the journals\nwhich chronicled the fact fell into his hands. He felt reassured and\nalmost at peace, as though he had really been dead.\n\nOn the evening of the day when Jean Valjean rescued Cosette from the\nclaws of the Thenardiers, he returned to Paris. He re-entered it at\nnightfall, with the child, by way of the Barrier Monceaux. There\nhe entered a cabriolet, which took him to the esplanade of the\nObservatoire. There he got out, paid the coachman, took Cosette by\nthe hand, and together they directed their steps through the\ndarkness,--through the deserted streets which adjoin the Ourcine and the\nGlaciere, towards the Boulevard de l'Hopital.\n\nThe day had been strange and filled with emotions for Cosette. They\nhad eaten some bread and cheese purchased in isolated taverns, behind\nhedges; they had changed carriages frequently; they had travelled short\ndistances on foot. She made no complaint, but she was weary, and Jean\nValjean perceived it by the way she dragged more and more on his hand\nas she walked. He took her on his back. Cosette, without letting go\nof Catherine, laid her head on Jean Valjean's shoulder, and there fell\nasleep.\n\n\n\n\nBOOK FOURTH.--THE GORBEAU HOVEL\n\n[Illustration: The Gorbeau Hovel  2b3-10-gorbeau-house]\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I--MASTER GORBEAU\n\nForty years ago, a rambler who had ventured into that unknown country of\nthe Salpetriere, and who had mounted to the Barriere d'Italie by way\nof the boulevard, reached a point where it might be said that Paris\ndisappeared. It was no longer solitude, for there were passers-by; it\nwas not the country, for there were houses and streets; it was not the\ncity, for the streets had ruts like highways, and the grass grew in\nthem; it was not a village, the houses were too lofty. What was it,\nthen? It was an inhabited spot where there was no one; it was a desert\nplace where there was some one; it was a boulevard of the great city, a\nstreet of Paris; more wild at night than the forest, more gloomy by day\nthan a cemetery.\n\nIt was the old quarter of the Marche-aux-Chevaux.\n\nThe rambler, if he risked himself outside the four decrepit walls of\nthis Marche-aux-Chevaux; if he consented even to pass beyond the Rue du\nPetit-Banquier, after leaving on his right a garden protected by high\nwalls; then a field in which tan-bark mills rose like gigantic beaver\nhuts; then an enclosure encumbered with timber, with a heap of stumps,\nsawdust, and shavings, on which stood a large dog, barking; then a long,\nlow, utterly dilapidated wall, with a little black door in mourning,\nladen with mosses, which were covered with flowers in the spring; then,\nin the most deserted spot, a frightful and decrepit building, on which\nran the inscription in large letters: POST NO BILLS,--this daring\nrambler would have reached little known latitudes at the corner of the\nRue des Vignes-Saint-Marcel. There, near a factory, and between two\ngarden walls, there could be seen, at that epoch, a mean building,\nwhich, at the first glance, seemed as small as a thatched hovel, and\nwhich was, in reality, as large as a cathedral. It presented its side\nand gable to the public road; hence its apparent diminutiveness. Nearly\nthe whole of the house was hidden. Only the door and one window could be\nseen.\n\nThis hovel was only one story high.\n\nThe first detail that struck the observer was, that the door could never\nhave been anything but the door of a hovel, while the window, if it\nhad been carved out of dressed stone instead of being in rough masonry,\nmight have been the lattice of a lordly mansion.\n\nThe door was nothing but a collection of worm-eaten planks roughly bound\ntogether by cross-beams which resembled roughly hewn logs. It\nopened directly on a steep staircase of lofty steps, muddy, chalky,\nplaster-stained, dusty steps, of the same width as itself, which\ncould be seen from the street, running straight up like a ladder and\ndisappearing in the darkness between two walls. The top of the shapeless\nbay into which this door shut was masked by a narrow scantling in the\ncentre of which a triangular hole had been sawed, which served both as\nwicket and air-hole when the door was closed. On the inside of the\ndoor the figures 52 had been traced with a couple of strokes of a brush\ndipped in ink, and above the scantling the same hand had daubed the\nnumber 50, so that one hesitated. Where was one? Above the door it said,\n\"Number 50\"; the inside replied, \"no, Number 52.\" No one knows what\ndust-colored figures were suspended like draperies from the triangular\nopening.\n\nThe window was large, sufficiently elevated, garnished with Venetian\nblinds, and with a frame in large square panes; only these large panes\nwere suffering from various wounds, which were both concealed and\nbetrayed by an ingenious paper bandage. And the blinds, dislocated and\nunpasted, threatened passers-by rather than screened the occupants.\nThe horizontal slats were missing here and there and had been naively\nreplaced with boards nailed on perpendicularly; so that what began as\na blind ended as a shutter. This door with an unclean, and this window\nwith an honest though dilapidated air, thus beheld on the same house,\nproduced the effect of two incomplete beggars walking side by side,\nwith different miens beneath the same rags, the one having always been a\nmendicant, and the other having once been a gentleman.\n\nThe staircase led to a very vast edifice which resembled a shed which\nhad been converted into a house. This edifice had, for its intestinal\ntube, a long corridor, on which opened to right and left sorts of\ncompartments of varied dimensions which were inhabitable under stress\nof circumstances, and rather more like stalls than cells. These chambers\nreceived their light from the vague waste grounds in the neighborhood.\n\nAll this was dark, disagreeable, wan, melancholy, sepulchral; traversed\naccording as the crevices lay in the roof or in the door, by cold rays\nor by icy winds. An interesting and picturesque peculiarity of this sort\nof dwelling is the enormous size of the spiders.\n\nTo the left of the entrance door, on the boulevard side, at about the\nheight of a man from the ground, a small window which had been walled up\nformed a square niche full of stones which the children had thrown there\nas they passed by.\n\nA portion of this building has recently been demolished. From what still\nremains of it one can form a judgment as to what it was in former days.\nAs a whole, it was not over a hundred years old. A hundred years is\nyouth in a church and age in a house. It seems as though man's lodging\npartook of his ephemeral character, and God's house of his eternity.\n\nThe postmen called the house Number 50-52; but it was known in the\nneighborhood as the Gorbeau house.\n\nLet us explain whence this appellation was derived.\n\nCollectors of petty details, who become herbalists of anecdotes, and\nprick slippery dates into their memories with a pin, know that there\nwas in Paris, during the last century, about 1770, two attorneys at the\nChatelet named, one Corbeau (Raven), the other Renard (Fox). The two\nnames had been forestalled by La Fontaine. The opportunity was too fine\nfor the lawyers; they made the most of it. A parody was immediately\nput in circulation in the galleries of the court-house, in verses that\nlimped a little:--\n\n\n          Maitre Corbeau, sur un dossier perche,[13]\n               Tenait dans son bee une saisie executoire;\n          Maitre Renard, par l'odeur alleche,\n               Lui fit a peu pres cette histoire:\n                    He! bonjour.  Etc.\n\n\nThe two honest practitioners, embarrassed by the jests, and finding the\nbearing of their heads interfered with by the shouts of laughter which\nfollowed them, resolved to get rid of their names, and hit upon the\nexpedient of applying to the king.\n\nTheir petition was presented to Louis XV. on the same day when the\nPapal Nuncio, on the one hand, and the Cardinal de la Roche-Aymon on the\nother, both devoutly kneeling, were each engaged in putting on, in his\nMajesty's presence, a slipper on the bare feet of Madame du Barry, who\nhad just got out of bed. The king, who was laughing, continued to laugh,\npassed gayly from the two bishops to the two lawyers, and bestowed on\nthese limbs of the law their former names, or nearly so. By the kings\ncommand, Maitre Corbeau was permitted to add a tail to his initial\nletter and to call himself Gorbeau. Maitre Renard was less lucky; all he\nobtained was leave to place a P in front of his R, and to call himself\nPrenard; so that the second name bore almost as much resemblance as the\nfirst.\n\nNow, according to local tradition, this Maitre Gorbeau had been the\nproprietor of the building numbered 50-52 on the Boulevard de l'Hopital.\nHe was even the author of the monumental window.\n\nHence the edifice bore the name of the Gorbeau house.\n\nOpposite this house, among the trees of the boulevard, rose a great elm\nwhich was three-quarters dead; almost directly facing it opens the Rue\nde la Barriere des Gobelins, a street then without houses, unpaved,\nplanted with unhealthy trees, which was green or muddy according to the\nseason, and which ended squarely in the exterior wall of Paris. An odor\nof copperas issued in puffs from the roofs of the neighboring factory.\n\nThe barrier was close at hand. In 1823 the city wall was still in\nexistence.\n\nThis barrier itself evoked gloomy fancies in the mind. It was the\nroad to Bicetre. It was through it that, under the Empire and the\nRestoration, prisoners condemned to death re-entered Paris on the day\nof their execution. It was there, that, about 1829, was committed that\nmysterious assassination, called \"The assassination of the Fontainebleau\nbarrier,\" whose authors justice was never able to discover; a melancholy\nproblem which has never been elucidated, a frightful enigma which has\nnever been unriddled. Take a few steps, and you come upon that fatal Rue\nCroulebarbe, where Ulbach stabbed the goat-girl of Ivry to the sound of\nthunder, as in the melodramas. A few paces more, and you arrive at the\nabominable pollarded elms of the Barriere Saint-Jacques, that expedient\nof the philanthropist to conceal the scaffold, that miserable and\nshameful Place de Grove of a shop-keeping and bourgeois society, which\nrecoiled before the death penalty, neither daring to abolish it with\ngrandeur, nor to uphold it with authority.\n\nLeaving aside this Place Saint-Jacques, which was, as it were,\npredestined, and which has always been horrible, probably the most\nmournful spot on that mournful boulevard, seven and thirty years ago,\nwas the spot which even to-day is so unattractive, where stood the\nbuilding Number 50-52.\n\nBourgeois houses only began to spring up there twenty-five years later.\nThe place was unpleasant. In addition to the gloomy thoughts which\nassailed one there, one was conscious of being between the Salpetriere,\na glimpse of whose dome could be seen, and Bicetre, whose outskirts one\nwas fairly touching; that is to say, between the madness of women and\nthe madness of men. As far as the eye could see, one could perceive\nnothing but the abattoirs, the city wall, and the fronts of a few\nfactories, resembling barracks or monasteries; everywhere about stood\nhovels, rubbish, ancient walls blackened like cerecloths, new white\nwalls like winding-sheets; everywhere parallel rows of trees, buildings\nerected on a line, flat constructions, long, cold rows, and the\nmelancholy sadness of right angles. Not an unevenness of the ground,\nnot a caprice in the architecture, not a fold. The ensemble was glacial,\nregular, hideous. Nothing oppresses the heart like symmetry. It is\nbecause symmetry is ennui, and ennui is at the very foundation of grief.\nDespair yawns. Something more terrible than a hell where one suffers\nmay be imagined, and that is a hell where one is bored. If such a hell\nexisted, that bit of the Boulevard de l'Hopital might have formed the\nentrance to it.\n\nNevertheless, at nightfall, at the moment when the daylight is\nvanishing, especially in winter, at the hour when the twilight breeze\ntears from the elms their last russet leaves, when the darkness is deep\nand starless, or when the moon and the wind are making openings in the\nclouds and losing themselves in the shadows, this boulevard suddenly\nbecomes frightful. The black lines sink inwards and are lost in the\nshades, like morsels of the infinite. The passer-by cannot refrain from\nrecalling the innumerable traditions of the place which are connected\nwith the gibbet. The solitude of this spot, where so many crimes have\nbeen committed, had something terrible about it. One almost had a\npresentiment of meeting with traps in that darkness; all the confused\nforms of the darkness seemed suspicious, and the long, hollow square, of\nwhich one caught a glimpse between each tree, seemed graves: by day it\nwas ugly; in the evening melancholy; by night it was sinister.\n\nIn summer, at twilight, one saw, here and there, a few old women seated\nat the foot of the elm, on benches mouldy with rain. These good old\nwomen were fond of begging.\n\nHowever, this quarter, which had a superannuated rather than an antique\nair, was tending even then to transformation. Even at that time any one\nwho was desirous of seeing it had to make haste. Each day some detail of\nthe whole effect was disappearing. For the last twenty years the station\nof the Orleans railway has stood beside the old faubourg and distracted\nit, as it does to-day. Wherever it is placed on the borders of a\ncapital, a railway station is the death of a suburb and the birth of a\ncity. It seems as though, around these great centres of the movements of\na people, the earth, full of germs, trembled and yawned, to engulf the\nancient dwellings of men and to allow new ones to spring forth, at the\nrattle of these powerful machines, at the breath of these monstrous\nhorses of civilization which devour coal and vomit fire. The old houses\ncrumble and new ones rise.\n\nSince the Orleans railway has invaded the region of the Salpetriere,\nthe ancient, narrow streets which adjoin the moats Saint-Victor and the\nJardin des Plantes tremble, as they are violently traversed three or\nfour times each day by those currents of coach fiacres and omnibuses\nwhich, in a given time, crowd back the houses to the right and the left;\nfor there are things which are odd when said that are rigorously exact;\nand just as it is true to say that in large cities the sun makes the\nsouthern fronts of houses to vegetate and grow, it is certain that the\nfrequent passage of vehicles enlarges streets. The symptoms of a new\nlife are evident. In this old provincial quarter, in the wildest nooks,\nthe pavement shows itself, the sidewalks begin to crawl and to grow\nlonger, even where there are as yet no pedestrians. One morning,--a\nmemorable morning in July, 1845,--black pots of bitumen were seen\nsmoking there; on that day it might be said that civilization had\narrived in the Rue de l'Ourcine, and that Paris had entered the suburb\nof Saint-Marceau.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II--A NEST FOR OWL AND A WARBLER\n\nIt was in front of this Gorbeau house that Jean Valjean halted. Like\nwild birds, he had chosen this desert place to construct his nest.\n\nHe fumbled in his waistcoat pocket, drew out a sort of a pass-key,\nopened the door, entered, closed it again carefully, and ascended the\nstaircase, still carrying Cosette.\n\nAt the top of the stairs he drew from his pocket another key, with\nwhich he opened another door. The chamber which he entered, and which\nhe closed again instantly, was a kind of moderately spacious attic,\nfurnished with a mattress laid on the floor, a table, and several\nchairs; a stove in which a fire was burning, and whose embers were\nvisible, stood in one corner. A lantern on the boulevard cast a vague\nlight into this poor room. At the extreme end there was a dressing-room\nwith a folding bed; Jean Valjean carried the child to this bed and laid\nher down there without waking her.\n\nHe struck a match and lighted a candle. All this was prepared beforehand\non the table, and, as he had done on the previous evening, he began\nto scrutinize Cosette's face with a gaze full of ecstasy, in which the\nexpression of kindness and tenderness almost amounted to aberration. The\nlittle girl, with that tranquil confidence which belongs only to extreme\nstrength and extreme weakness, had fallen asleep without knowing with\nwhom she was, and continued to sleep without knowing where she was.\n\nJean Valjean bent down and kissed that child's hand.\n\nNine months before he had kissed the hand of the mother, who had also\njust fallen asleep.\n\nThe same sad, piercing, religious sentiment filled his heart.\n\nHe knelt beside Cosette's bed.\n\nlt was broad daylight, and the child still slept. A wan ray of the\nDecember sun penetrated the window of the attic and lay upon the\nceiling in long threads of light and shade. All at once a heavily laden\ncarrier's cart, which was passing along the boulevard, shook the frail\nbed, like a clap of thunder, and made it quiver from top to bottom.\n\n\"Yes, madame!\" cried Cosette, waking with a start, \"here I am! here I\nam!\"\n\nAnd she sprang out of bed, her eyes still half shut with the heaviness\nof sleep, extending her arms towards the corner of the wall.\n\n\"Ah! mon Dieu, my broom!\" said she.\n\nShe opened her eyes wide now, and beheld the smiling countenance of Jean\nValjean.\n\n\"Ah! so it is true!\" said the child. \"Good morning, Monsieur.\"\n\nChildren accept joy and happiness instantly and familiarly, being\nthemselves by nature joy and happiness.\n\nCosette caught sight of Catherine at the foot of her bed, and took\npossession of her, and, as she played, she put a hundred questions to\nJean Valjean. Where was she? Was Paris very large? Was Madame Thenardier\nvery far away? Was she to go back? etc., etc. All at once she exclaimed,\n\"How pretty it is here!\"\n\nIt was a frightful hole, but she felt free.\n\n\"Must I sweep?\" she resumed at last.\n\n\"Play!\" said Jean Valjean.\n\nThe day passed thus. Cosette, without troubling herself to understand\nanything, was inexpressibly happy with that doll and that kind man.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III--TWO MISFORTUNES MAKE ONE PIECE OF GOOD FORTUNE\n\nOn the following morning, at daybreak, Jean Valjean was still by\nCosette's bedside; he watched there motionless, waiting for her to wake.\n\nSome new thing had come into his soul.\n\nJean Valjean had never loved anything; for twenty-five years he had been\nalone in the world. He had never been father, lover, husband, friend. In\nthe prison he had been vicious, gloomy, chaste, ignorant, and shy.\nThe heart of that ex-convict was full of virginity. His sister and his\nsister's children had left him only a vague and far-off memory which\nhad finally almost completely vanished; he had made every effort to\nfind them, and not having been able to find them, he had forgotten them.\nHuman nature is made thus; the other tender emotions of his youth, if he\nhad ever had any, had fallen into an abyss.\n\nWhen he saw Cosette, when he had taken possession of her, carried her\noff, and delivered her, he felt his heart moved within him.\n\nAll the passion and affection within him awoke, and rushed towards that\nchild. He approached the bed, where she lay sleeping, and trembled with\njoy. He suffered all the pangs of a mother, and he knew not what it\nmeant; for that great and singular movement of a heart which begins to\nlove is a very obscure and a very sweet thing.\n\nPoor old man, with a perfectly new heart!\n\nOnly, as he was five and fifty, and Cosette eight years of age, all that\nmight have been love in the whole course of his life flowed together\ninto a sort of ineffable light.\n\nIt was the second white apparition which he had encountered. The Bishop\nhad caused the dawn of virtue to rise on his horizon; Cosette caused the\ndawn of love to rise.\n\nThe early days passed in this dazzled state.\n\nCosette, on her side, had also, unknown to herself, become another\nbeing, poor little thing! She was so little when her mother left her,\nthat she no longer remembered her. Like all children, who resemble young\nshoots of the vine, which cling to everything, she had tried to love;\nshe had not succeeded. All had repulsed her,--the Thenardiers, their\nchildren, other children. She had loved the dog, and he had died, after\nwhich nothing and nobody would have anything to do with her. It is a sad\nthing to say, and we have already intimated it, that, at eight years of\nage, her heart was cold. It was not her fault; it was not the faculty\nof loving that she lacked; alas! it was the possibility. Thus, from the\nvery first day, all her sentient and thinking powers loved this kind\nman. She felt that which she had never felt before--a sensation of\nexpansion.\n\nThe man no longer produced on her the effect of being old or poor; she\nthought Jean Valjean handsome, just as she thought the hovel pretty.\n\nThese are the effects of the dawn, of childhood, of joy. The novelty of\nthe earth and of life counts for something here. Nothing is so charming\nas the coloring reflection of happiness on a garret. We all have in our\npast a delightful garret.\n\nNature, a difference of fifty years, had set a profound gulf between\nJean Valjean and Cosette; destiny filled in this gulf. Destiny suddenly\nunited and wedded with its irresistible power these two uprooted\nexistences, differing in age, alike in sorrow. One, in fact, completed\nthe other. Cosette's instinct sought a father, as Jean Valjean's\ninstinct sought a child. To meet was to find each other. At the\nmysterious moment when their hands touched, they were welded together.\nWhen these two souls perceived each other, they recognized each other as\nnecessary to each other, and embraced each other closely.\n\nTaking the words in their most comprehensive and absolute sense, we\nmay say that, separated from every one by the walls of the tomb, Jean\nValjean was the widower, and Cosette was the orphan: this situation\ncaused Jean Valjean to become Cosette's father after a celestial\nfashion.\n\nAnd in truth, the mysterious impression produced on Cosette in the\ndepths of the forest of Chelles by the hand of Jean Valjean grasping\nhers in the dark was not an illusion, but a reality. The entrance of\nthat man into the destiny of that child had been the advent of God.\n\nMoreover, Jean Valjean had chosen his refuge well. There he seemed\nperfectly secure.\n\nThe chamber with a dressing-room, which he occupied with Cosette, was\nthe one whose window opened on the boulevard. This being the only window\nin the house, no neighbors' glances were to be feared from across the\nway or at the side.\n\nThe ground-floor of Number 50-52, a sort of dilapidated penthouse,\nserved as a wagon-house for market-gardeners, and no communication\nexisted between it and the first story. It was separated by the\nflooring, which had neither traps nor stairs, and which formed the\ndiaphragm of the building, as it were. The first story contained, as we\nhave said, numerous chambers and several attics, only one of which\nwas occupied by the old woman who took charge of Jean Valjean's\nhousekeeping; all the rest was uninhabited.\n\nIt was this old woman, ornamented with the name of the principal lodger,\nand in reality intrusted with the functions of portress, who had let\nhim the lodging on Christmas eve. He had represented himself to her as a\ngentleman of means who had been ruined by Spanish bonds, who was coming\nthere to live with his little daughter. He had paid her six months in\nadvance, and had commissioned the old woman to furnish the chamber and\ndressing-room, as we have seen. It was this good woman who had lighted\nthe fire in the stove, and prepared everything on the evening of their\narrival.\n\nWeek followed week; these two beings led a happy life in that hovel.\n\nCosette laughed, chattered, and sang from daybreak. Children have their\nmorning song as well as birds.\n\nIt sometimes happened that Jean Valjean clasped her tiny red hand, all\ncracked with chilblains, and kissed it. The poor child, who was used\nto being beaten, did not know the meaning of this, and ran away in\nconfusion.\n\nAt times she became serious and stared at her little black gown. Cosette\nwas no longer in rags; she was in mourning. She had emerged from misery,\nand she was entering into life.\n\nJean Valjean had undertaken to teach her to read. Sometimes, as he made\nthe child spell, he remembered that it was with the idea of doing evil\nthat he had learned to read in prison. This idea had ended in teaching a\nchild to read. Then the ex-convict smiled with the pensive smile of the\nangels.\n\nHe felt in it a premeditation from on high, the will of some one who\nwas not man, and he became absorbed in revery. Good thoughts have their\nabysses as well as evil ones.\n\nTo teach Cosette to read, and to let her play, this constituted nearly\nthe whole of Jean Valjean's existence. And then he talked of her mother,\nand he made her pray.\n\nShe called him father, and knew no other name for him.\n\nHe passed hours in watching her dressing and undressing her doll, and in\nlistening to her prattle. Life, henceforth, appeared to him to be full\nof interest; men seemed to him good and just; he no longer reproached\nany one in thought; he saw no reason why he should not live to be a very\nold man, now that this child loved him. He saw a whole future stretching\nout before him, illuminated by Cosette as by a charming light. The best\nof us are not exempt from egotistical thoughts. At times, he reflected\nwith a sort of joy that she would be ugly.\n\nThis is only a personal opinion; but, to utter our whole thought, at the\npoint where Jean Valjean had arrived when he began to love Cosette, it\nis by no means clear to us that he did not need this encouragement in\norder that he might persevere in well-doing. He had just viewed the\nmalice of men and the misery of society under a new aspect--incomplete\naspects, which unfortunately only exhibited one side of the truth,\nthe fate of woman as summed up in Fantine, and public authority as\npersonified in Javert. He had returned to prison, this time for having\ndone right; he had quaffed fresh bitterness; disgust and lassitude were\noverpowering him; even the memory of the Bishop probably suffered\na temporary eclipse, though sure to reappear later on luminous and\ntriumphant; but, after all, that sacred memory was growing dim.\nWho knows whether Jean Valjean had not been on the eve of growing\ndiscouraged and of falling once more? He loved and grew strong again.\nAlas! he walked with no less indecision than Cosette. He protected her,\nand she strengthened him. Thanks to him, she could walk through life;\nthanks to her, he could continue in virtue. He was that child's stay,\nand she was his prop. Oh, unfathomable and divine mystery of the\nbalances of destiny!\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV--THE REMARKS OF THE PRINCIPAL TENANT\n\nJean Valjean was prudent enough never to go out by day. Every evening,\nat twilight, he walked for an hour or two, sometimes alone, often with\nCosette, seeking the most deserted side alleys of the boulevard, and\nentering churches at nightfall. He liked to go to Saint-Medard, which is\nthe nearest church. When he did not take Cosette with him, she remained\nwith the old woman; but the child's delight was to go out with the good\nman. She preferred an hour with him to all her rapturous tete-a-tetes\nwith Catherine. He held her hand as they walked, and said sweet things\nto her.\n\nIt turned out that Cosette was a very gay little person.\n\nThe old woman attended to the housekeeping and cooking and went to\nmarket.\n\nThey lived soberly, always having a little fire, but like people in\nvery moderate circumstances. Jean Valjean had made no alterations in\nthe furniture as it was the first day; he had merely had the glass door\nleading to Cosette's dressing-room replaced by a solid door.\n\nHe still wore his yellow coat, his black breeches, and his old hat.\nIn the street, he was taken for a poor man. It sometimes happened that\nkind-hearted women turned back to bestow a sou on him. Jean Valjean\naccepted the sou with a deep bow. It also happened occasionally that he\nencountered some poor wretch asking alms; then he looked behind him\nto make sure that no one was observing him, stealthily approached the\nunfortunate man, put a piece of money into his hand, often a silver\ncoin, and walked rapidly away. This had its disadvantages. He began\nto be known in the neighborhood under the name of the beggar who gives\nalms.\n\nThe old principal lodger, a cross-looking creature, who was\nthoroughly permeated, so far as her neighbors were concerned, with the\ninquisitiveness peculiar to envious persons, scrutinized Jean Valjean\na great deal, without his suspecting the fact. She was a little deaf,\nwhich rendered her talkative. There remained to her from her past, two\nteeth,--one above, the other below,--which she was continually knocking\nagainst each other. She had questioned Cosette, who had not been able\nto tell her anything, since she knew nothing herself except that she had\ncome from Montfermeil. One morning, this spy saw Jean Valjean, with\nan air which struck the old gossip as peculiar, entering one of the\nuninhabited compartments of the hovel. She followed him with the step\nof an old cat, and was able to observe him without being seen, through a\ncrack in the door, which was directly opposite him. Jean Valjean had his\nback turned towards this door, by way of greater security, no doubt. The\nold woman saw him fumble in his pocket and draw thence a case, scissors,\nand thread; then he began to rip the lining of one of the skirts of his\ncoat, and from the opening he took a bit of yellowish paper, which he\nunfolded. The old woman recognized, with terror, the fact that it was\na bank-bill for a thousand francs. It was the second or third only that\nshe had seen in the course of her existence. She fled in alarm.\n\nA moment later, Jean Valjean accosted her, and asked her to go and\nget this thousand-franc bill changed for him, adding that it was his\nquarterly income, which he had received the day before. \"Where?\" thought\nthe old woman. \"He did not go out until six o'clock in the evening, and\nthe government bank certainly is not open at that hour.\" The old\nwoman went to get the bill changed, and mentioned her surmises. That\nthousand-franc note, commented on and multiplied, produced a vast\namount of terrified discussion among the gossips of the Rue des Vignes\nSaint-Marcel.\n\nA few days later, it chanced that Jean Valjean was sawing some wood, in\nhis shirt-sleeves, in the corridor. The old woman was in the chamber,\nputting things in order. She was alone. Cosette was occupied in admiring\nthe wood as it was sawed. The old woman caught sight of the coat hanging\non a nail, and examined it. The lining had been sewed up again. The good\nwoman felt of it carefully, and thought she observed in the skirts and\nrevers thicknesses of paper. More thousand-franc bank-bills, no doubt!\n\nShe also noticed that there were all sorts of things in the pockets.\nNot only the needles, thread, and scissors which she had seen, but a big\npocket-book, a very large knife, and--a suspicious circumstance--several\nwigs of various colors. Each pocket of this coat had the air of being in\na manner provided against unexpected accidents.\n\nThus the inhabitants of the house reached the last days of winter.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V--A FIVE-FRANC PIECE FALLS ON THE GROUND AND PRODUCES A TUMULT\n\nNear Saint-Medard's church there was a poor man who was in the habit of\ncrouching on the brink of a public well which had been condemned, and\non whom Jean Valjean was fond of bestowing charity. He never passed this\nman without giving him a few sous. Sometimes he spoke to him. Those who\nenvied this mendicant said that he belonged to the police. He was an\nex-beadle of seventy-five, who was constantly mumbling his prayers.\n\nOne evening, as Jean Valjean was passing by, when he had not Cosette\nwith him, he saw the beggar in his usual place, beneath the lantern\nwhich had just been lighted. The man seemed engaged in prayer, according\nto his custom, and was much bent over. Jean Valjean stepped up to him\nand placed his customary alms in his hand. The mendicant raised his\neyes suddenly, stared intently at Jean Valjean, then dropped his head\nquickly. This movement was like a flash of lightning. Jean Valjean was\nseized with a shudder. It seemed to him that he had just caught sight,\nby the light of the street lantern, not of the placid and beaming\nvisage of the old beadle, but of a well-known and startling face. He\nexperienced the same impression that one would have on finding one's\nself, all of a sudden, face to face, in the dark, with a tiger. He\nrecoiled, terrified, petrified, daring neither to breathe, to speak,\nto remain, nor to flee, staring at the beggar who had dropped his head,\nwhich was enveloped in a rag, and no longer appeared to know that he\nwas there. At this strange moment, an instinct--possibly the mysterious\ninstinct of self-preservation,--restrained Jean Valjean from uttering a\nword. The beggar had the same figure, the same rags, the same appearance\nas he had every day. \"Bah!\" said Jean Valjean, \"I am mad! I am dreaming!\nImpossible!\" And he returned profoundly troubled.\n\nHe hardly dared to confess, even to himself, that the face which he\nthought he had seen was the face of Javert.\n\nThat night, on thinking the matter over, he regretted not having\nquestioned the man, in order to force him to raise his head a second\ntime.\n\nOn the following day, at nightfall, he went back. The beggar was at his\npost. \"Good day, my good man,\" said Jean Valjean, resolutely, handing\nhim a sou. The beggar raised his head, and replied in a whining voice,\n\"Thanks, my good sir.\" It was unmistakably the ex-beadle.\n\nJean Valjean felt completely reassured. He began to laugh. \"How the\ndeuce could I have thought that I saw Javert there?\" he thought. \"Am I\ngoing to lose my eyesight now?\" And he thought no more about it.\n\nA few days afterwards,--it might have been at eight o'clock in the\nevening,--he was in his room, and engaged in making Cosette spell aloud,\nwhen he heard the house door open and then shut again. This struck him\nas singular. The old woman, who was the only inhabitant of the house\nexcept himself, always went to bed at nightfall, so that she might not\nburn out her candles. Jean Valjean made a sign to Cosette to be quiet.\nHe heard some one ascending the stairs. It might possibly be the old\nwoman, who might have fallen ill and have been out to the apothecary's.\nJean Valjean listened.\n\nThe step was heavy, and sounded like that of a man; but the old woman\nwore stout shoes, and there is nothing which so strongly resembles the\nstep of a man as that of an old woman. Nevertheless, Jean Valjean blew\nout his candle.\n\nHe had sent Cosette to bed, saying to her in a low voice, \"Get into bed\nvery softly\"; and as he kissed her brow, the steps paused.\n\nJean Valjean remained silent, motionless, with his back towards the\ndoor, seated on the chair from which he had not stirred, and holding his\nbreath in the dark.\n\nAfter the expiration of a rather long interval, he turned round, as he\nheard nothing more, and, as he raised his eyes towards the door of his\nchamber, he saw a light through the keyhole. This light formed a sort\nof sinister star in the blackness of the door and the wall. There was\nevidently some one there, who was holding a candle in his hand and\nlistening.\n\nSeveral minutes elapsed thus, and the light retreated. But he heard no\nsound of footsteps, which seemed to indicate that the person who had\nbeen listening at the door had removed his shoes.\n\nJean Valjean threw himself, all dressed as he was, on his bed, and could\nnot close his eyes all night.\n\nAt daybreak, just as he was falling into a doze through fatigue, he was\nawakened by the creaking of a door which opened on some attic at the\nend of the corridor, then he heard the same masculine footstep which had\nascended the stairs on the preceding evening. The step was approaching.\nHe sprang off the bed and applied his eye to the keyhole, which was\ntolerably large, hoping to see the person who had made his way by night\ninto the house and had listened at his door, as he passed. It was a\nman, in fact, who passed, this time without pausing, in front of Jean\nValjean's chamber. The corridor was too dark to allow of the person's\nface being distinguished; but when the man reached the staircase, a\nray of light from without made it stand out like a silhouette, and Jean\nValjean had a complete view of his back. The man was of lofty stature,\nclad in a long frock-coat, with a cudgel under his arm. The formidable\nneck and shoulders belonged to Javert.\n\nJean Valjean might have attempted to catch another glimpse of him\nthrough his window opening on the boulevard, but he would have been\nobliged to open the window: he dared not.\n\nIt was evident that this man had entered with a key, and like himself.\nWho had given him that key? What was the meaning of this?\n\nWhen the old woman came to do the work, at seven o'clock in the morning,\nJean Valjean cast a penetrating glance on her, but he did not question\nher. The good woman appeared as usual.\n\nAs she swept up she remarked to him:--\n\n\"Possibly Monsieur may have heard some one come in last night?\"\n\nAt that age, and on that boulevard, eight o'clock in the evening was the\ndead of the night.\n\n\"That is true, by the way,\" he replied, in the most natural tone\npossible. \"Who was it?\"\n\n\"It was a new lodger who has come into the house,\" said the old woman.\n\n\"And what is his name?\"\n\n\"I don't know exactly; Dumont, or Daumont, or some name of that sort.\"\n\n\"And who is this Monsieur Dumont?\"\n\nThe old woman gazed at him with her little polecat eyes, and answered:--\n\n\"A gentleman of property, like yourself.\"\n\nPerhaps she had no ulterior meaning. Jean Valjean thought he perceived\none.\n\nWhen the old woman had taken her departure, he did up a hundred francs\nwhich he had in a cupboard, into a roll, and put it in his pocket. In\nspite of all the precautions which he took in this operation so that he\nmight not be heard rattling silver, a hundred-sou piece escaped from his\nhands and rolled noisily on the floor.\n\nWhen darkness came on, he descended and carefully scrutinized both sides\nof the boulevard. He saw no one. The boulevard appeared to be absolutely\ndeserted. It is true that a person can conceal himself behind trees.\n\nHe went up stairs again.\n\n\"Come.\" he said to Cosette.\n\nHe took her by the hand, and they both went out.\n\n\n\n\nBOOK FIFTH.--FOR A BLACK HUNT, A MUTE PACK\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I--THE ZIGZAGS OF STRATEGY\n\nAn observation here becomes necessary, in view of the pages which the\nreader is about to peruse, and of others which will be met with further\non.\n\nThe author of this book, who regrets the necessity of mentioning\nhimself, has been absent from Paris for many years. Paris has been\ntransformed since he quitted it. A new city has arisen, which is, after\na fashion, unknown to him. There is no need for him to say that he loves\nParis: Paris is his mind's natal city. In consequence of demolitions and\nreconstructions, the Paris of his youth, that Paris which he bore away\nreligiously in his memory, is now a Paris of days gone by. He must\nbe permitted to speak of that Paris as though it still existed. It is\npossible that when the author conducts his readers to a spot and says,\n\"In such a street there stands such and such a house,\" neither street\nnor house will any longer exist in that locality. Readers may verify\nthe facts if they care to take the trouble. For his own part, he is\nunacquainted with the new Paris, and he writes with the old Paris before\nhis eyes in an illusion which is precious to him. It is a delight to him\nto dream that there still lingers behind him something of that which he\nbeheld when he was in his own country, and that all has not vanished.\nSo long as you go and come in your native land, you imagine that those\nstreets are a matter of indifference to you; that those windows,\nthose roofs, and those doors are nothing to you; that those walls are\nstrangers to you; that those trees are merely the first encountered\nhaphazard; that those houses, which you do not enter, are useless to\nyou; that the pavements which you tread are merely stones. Later on,\nwhen you are no longer there, you perceive that the streets are dear to\nyou; that you miss those roofs, those doors; and that those walls are\nnecessary to you, those trees are well beloved by you; that you entered\nthose houses which you never entered, every day, and that you have left\na part of your heart, of your blood, of your soul, in those pavements.\nAll those places which you no longer behold, which you may never\nbehold again, perchance, and whose memory you have cherished, take on\na melancholy charm, recur to your mind with the melancholy of an\napparition, make the holy land visible to you, and are, so to speak,\nthe very form of France, and you love them; and you call them up as they\nare, as they were, and you persist in this, and you will submit to no\nchange: for you are attached to the figure of your fatherland as to the\nface of your mother.\n\nMay we, then, be permitted to speak of the past in the present? That\nsaid, we beg the reader to take note of it, and we continue.\n\nJean Valjean instantly quitted the boulevard and plunged into the\nstreets, taking the most intricate lines which he could devise,\nreturning on his track at times, to make sure that he was not being\nfollowed.\n\n[Illustration: The Black Hunt  2b5-1-black-hunt]\n\nThis manoeuvre is peculiar to the hunted stag. On soil where an\nimprint of the track may be left, this manoeuvre possesses, among other\nadvantages, that of deceiving the huntsmen and the dogs, by throwing\nthem on the wrong scent. In venery this is called false re-imbushment.\n\nThe moon was full that night. Jean Valjean was not sorry for this. The\nmoon, still very close to the horizon, cast great masses of light and\nshadow in the streets. Jean Valjean could glide along close to the\nhouses on the dark side, and yet keep watch on the light side. He did\nnot, perhaps, take sufficiently into consideration the fact that the\ndark side escaped him. Still, in the deserted lanes which lie near the\nRue Poliveau, he thought he felt certain that no one was following him.\n\nCosette walked on without asking any questions. The sufferings of the\nfirst six years of her life had instilled something passive into her\nnature. Moreover,--and this is a remark to which we shall frequently\nhave occasion to recur,--she had grown used, without being herself\naware of it, to the peculiarities of this good man and to the freaks of\ndestiny. And then she was with him, and she felt safe.\n\nJean Valjean knew no more where he was going than did Cosette. He\ntrusted in God, as she trusted in him. It seemed as though he also were\nclinging to the hand of some one greater than himself; he thought he\nfelt a being leading him, though invisible. However, he had no settled\nidea, no plan, no project. He was not even absolutely sure that it was\nJavert, and then it might have been Javert, without Javert knowing that\nhe was Jean Valjean. Was not he disguised? Was not he believed to be\ndead? Still, queer things had been going on for several days. He wanted\nno more of them. He was determined not to return to the Gorbeau house.\nLike the wild animal chased from its lair, he was seeking a hole in\nwhich he might hide until he could find one where he might dwell.\n\nJean Valjean described many and varied labyrinths in the Mouffetard\nquarter, which was already asleep, as though the discipline of the\nMiddle Ages and the yoke of the curfew still existed; he combined in\nvarious manners, with cunning strategy, the Rue Censier and the Rue\nCopeau, the Rue du Battoir-Saint-Victor and the Rue du Puits l'Ermite.\nThere are lodging houses in this locality, but he did not even enter\none, finding nothing which suited him. He had no doubt that if any one\nhad chanced to be upon his track, they would have lost it.\n\nAs eleven o'clock struck from Saint-Etienne-du-Mont, he was traversing\nthe Rue de Pontoise, in front of the office of the commissary of police,\nsituated at No. 14. A few moments later, the instinct of which we have\nspoken above made him turn round. At that moment he saw distinctly,\nthanks to the commissary's lantern, which betrayed them, three men\nwho were following him closely, pass, one after the other, under that\nlantern, on the dark side of the street. One of the three entered the\nalley leading to the commissary's house. The one who marched at their\nhead struck him as decidedly suspicious.\n\n\"Come, child,\" he said to Cosette; and he made haste to quit the Rue\nPontoise.\n\nHe took a circuit, turned into the Passage des Patriarches, which was\nclosed on account of the hour, strode along the Rue de l'Epee-de-Bois\nand the Rue de l'Arbalete, and plunged into the Rue des Postes.\n\nAt that time there was a square formed by the intersection of\nstreets, where the College Rollin stands to-day, and where the Rue\nNeuve-Sainte-Genevieve turns off.\n\nIt is understood, of course, that the Rue Neuve-Sainte-Genevieve is an\nold street, and that a posting-chaise does not pass through the Rue des\nPostes once in ten years. In the thirteenth century this Rue des Postes\nwas inhabited by potters, and its real name is Rue des Pots.\n\nThe moon cast a livid light into this open space. Jean Valjean went into\nambush in a doorway, calculating that if the men were still following\nhim, he could not fail to get a good look at them, as they traversed\nthis illuminated space.\n\nIn point of fact, three minutes had not elapsed when the men made their\nappearance. There were four of them now. All were tall, dressed in long,\nbrown coats, with round hats, and huge cudgels in their hands. Their\ngreat stature and their vast fists rendered them no less alarming\nthan did their sinister stride through the darkness. One would have\npronounced them four spectres disguised as bourgeois.\n\nThey halted in the middle of the space and formed a group, like men in\nconsultation. They had an air of indecision. The one who appeared to be\ntheir leader turned round and pointed hastily with his right hand in the\ndirection which Jean Valjean had taken; another seemed to indicate the\ncontrary direction with considerable obstinacy. At the moment when the\nfirst man wheeled round, the moon fell full in his face. Jean Valjean\nrecognized Javert perfectly.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II--IT IS LUCKY THAT THE PONT D'AUSTERLITZ BEARS CARRIAGES\n\nUncertainty was at an end for Jean Valjean: fortunately it still lasted\nfor the men. He took advantage of their hesitation. It was time lost for\nthem, but gained for him. He slipped from under the gate where he had\nconcealed himself, and went down the Rue des Postes, towards the region\nof the Jardin des Plantes. Cosette was beginning to be tired. He took\nher in his arms and carried her. There were no passers-by, and the\nstreet lanterns had not been lighted on account of there being a moon.\n\nHe redoubled his pace.\n\nIn a few strides he had reached the Goblet potteries, on the front\nof which the moonlight rendered distinctly legible the ancient\ninscription:--\n\n               De Goblet fils c'est ici la fabrique;[14]\n               Venez choisir des cruches et des broos,\n               Des pots a fleurs, des tuyaux, de la brique.\n               A tout venant le Coeur vend des Carreaux.\n\n\n\nHe left behind him the Rue de la Clef, then the Fountain Saint-Victor,\nskirted the Jardin des Plantes by the lower streets, and reached the\nquay. There he turned round. The quay was deserted. The streets were\ndeserted. There was no one behind him. He drew a long breath.\n\nHe gained the Pont d'Austerlitz.\n\nTolls were still collected there at that epoch.\n\nHe presented himself at the toll office and handed over a sou.\n\n\"It is two sous,\" said the old soldier in charge of the bridge. \"You are\ncarrying a child who can walk. Pay for two.\"\n\nHe paid, vexed that his passage should have aroused remark. Every flight\nshould be an imperceptible slipping away.\n\nA heavy cart was crossing the Seine at the same time as himself, and on\nits way, like him, to the right bank. This was of use to him. He could\ntraverse the bridge in the shadow of the cart.\n\nTowards the middle of the Bridge, Cosette, whose feet were benumbed,\nwanted to walk. He set her on the ground and took her hand again.\n\nThe bridge once crossed, he perceived some timber-yards on his right. He\ndirected his course thither. In order to reach them, it was necessary to\nrisk himself in a tolerably large unsheltered and illuminated space.\nHe did not hesitate. Those who were on his track had evidently lost the\nscent, and Jean Valjean believed himself to be out of danger. Hunted,\nyes; followed, no.\n\nA little street, the Rue du Chemin-Vert-Saint-Antoine, opened out\nbetween two timber-yards enclosed in walls. This street was dark and\nnarrow and seemed made expressly for him. Before entering it he cast a\nglance behind him.\n\nFrom the point where he stood he could see the whole extent of the Pont\nd'Austerlitz.\n\nFour shadows were just entering on the bridge.\n\nThese shadows had their backs turned to the Jardin des Plantes and were\non their way to the right bank.\n\nThese four shadows were the four men.\n\nJean Valjean shuddered like the wild beast which is recaptured.\n\nOne hope remained to him; it was, that the men had not, perhaps, stepped\non the bridge, and had not caught sight of him while he was crossing the\nlarge illuminated space, holding Cosette by the hand.\n\nIn that case, by plunging into the little street before him, he\nmight escape, if he could reach the timber-yards, the marshes, the\nmarket-gardens, the uninhabited ground which was not built upon.\n\nIt seemed to him that he might commit himself to that silent little\nstreet. He entered it.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III--TO WIT, THE PLAN OF PARIS IN 1727\n\nThree hundred paces further on, he arrived at a point where the street\nforked. It separated into two streets, which ran in a slanting line, one\nto the right, and the other to the left.\n\nJean Valjean had before him what resembled the two branches of a Y.\nWhich should he choose? He did not hesitate, but took the one on the\nright.\n\nWhy?\n\nBecause that to the left ran towards a suburb, that is to say, towards\ninhabited regions, and the right branch towards the open country, that\nis to say, towards deserted regions.\n\nHowever, they no longer walked very fast. Cosette's pace retarded Jean\nValjean's.\n\nHe took her up and carried her again. Cosette laid her head on the\nshoulder of the good man and said not a word.\n\nHe turned round from time to time and looked behind him. He took care to\nkeep always on the dark side of the street. The street was straight\nin his rear. The first two or three times that he turned round he saw\nnothing; the silence was profound, and he continued his march somewhat\nreassured. All at once, on turning round, he thought he perceived in the\nportion of the street which he had just passed through, far off in the\nobscurity, something which was moving.\n\nHe rushed forward precipitately rather than walked, hoping to find some\nside-street, to make his escape through it, and thus to break his scent\nonce more.\n\nHe arrived at a wall.\n\nThis wall, however, did not absolutely prevent further progress; it was\na wall which bordered a transverse street, in which the one he had taken\nended.\n\nHere again, he was obliged to come to a decision; should he go to the\nright or to the left.\n\nHe glanced to the right. The fragmentary lane was prolonged between\nbuildings which were either sheds or barns, then ended at a blind alley.\nThe extremity of the cul-de-sac was distinctly visible,--a lofty white\nwall.\n\nHe glanced to the left. On that side the lane was open, and about\ntwo hundred paces further on, ran into a street of which it was the\naffluent. On that side lay safety.\n\nAt the moment when Jean Valjean was meditating a turn to the left, in\nan effort to reach the street which he saw at the end of the lane, he\nperceived a sort of motionless, black statue at the corner of the lane\nand the street towards which he was on the point of directing his steps.\n\nIt was some one, a man, who had evidently just been posted there, and\nwho was barring the passage and waiting.\n\nJean Valjean recoiled.\n\nThe point of Paris where Jean Valjean found himself, situated between\nthe Faubourg Saint-Antoine and la Rapee, is one of those which recent\nimprovements have transformed from top to bottom,--resulting in\ndisfigurement according to some, and in a transfiguration according to\nothers. The market-gardens, the timber-yards, and the old buildings\nhave been effaced. To-day, there are brand-new, wide streets, arenas,\ncircuses, hippodromes, railway stations, and a prison, Mazas, there;\nprogress, as the reader sees, with its antidote.\n\nHalf a century ago, in that ordinary, popular tongue, which is all\ncompounded of traditions, which persists in calling the Institut les\nQuatre-Nations, and the Opera-Comique Feydeau, the precise spot\nwhither Jean Valjean had arrived was called le Petit Picpus. The\nPorte Saint-Jacques, the Porte Paris, the Barriere des Sergents, the\nPorcherons, la Galiote, les Celestins, les Capucins, le Mail, la Bourbe,\nl'Arbre de Cracovie, la Petite-Pologne--these are the names of old Paris\nwhich survive amid the new. The memory of the populace hovers over these\nrelics of the past.\n\nLe Petit-Picpus, which, moreover, hardly ever had any existence, and\nnever was more than the outline of a quarter, had nearly the monkish\naspect of a Spanish town. The roads were not much paved; the streets\nwere not much built up. With the exception of the two or three streets,\nof which we shall presently speak, all was wall and solitude there. Not\na shop, not a vehicle, hardly a candle lighted here and there in the\nwindows; all lights extinguished after ten o'clock. Gardens, convents,\ntimber-yards, marshes; occasional lowly dwellings and great walls as\nhigh as the houses.\n\nSuch was this quarter in the last century. The Revolution snubbed\nit soundly. The republican government demolished and cut through it.\nRubbish shoots were established there. Thirty years ago, this quarter\nwas disappearing under the erasing process of new buildings. To-day,\nit has been utterly blotted out. The Petit-Picpus, of which no existing\nplan has preserved a trace, is indicated with sufficient clearness\nin the plan of 1727, published at Paris by Denis Thierry, Rue\nSaint-Jacques, opposite the Rue du Platre; and at Lyons, by Jean Girin,\nRue Merciere, at the sign of Prudence. Petit-Picpus had, as\nwe have just mentioned, a Y of streets, formed by the Rue du\nChemin-Vert-Saint-Antoine, which spread out in two branches, taking on\nthe left the name of Little Picpus Street, and on the right the name of\nthe Rue Polonceau. The two limbs of the Y were connected at the apex\nas by a bar; this bar was called Rue Droit-Mur. The Rue Polonceau ended\nthere; Rue Petit-Picpus passed on, and ascended towards the Lenoir\nmarket. A person coming from the Seine reached the extremity of the Rue\nPolonceau, and had on his right the Rue Droit-Mur, turning abruptly at a\nright angle, in front of him the wall of that street, and on his right a\ntruncated prolongation of the Rue Droit-Mur, which had no issue and was\ncalled the Cul-de-Sac Genrot.\n\nIt was here that Jean Valjean stood.\n\nAs we have just said, on catching sight of that black silhouette\nstanding on guard at the angle of the Rue Droit-Mur and the Rue\nPetit-Picpus, he recoiled. There could be no doubt of it. That phantom\nwas lying in wait for him.\n\nWhat was he to do?\n\nThe time for retreating was passed. That which he had perceived in\nmovement an instant before, in the distant darkness, was Javert and his\nsquad without a doubt. Javert was probably already at the commencement\nof the street at whose end Jean Valjean stood. Javert, to all\nappearances, was acquainted with this little labyrinth, and had taken\nhis precautions by sending one of his men to guard the exit. These\nsurmises, which so closely resembled proofs, whirled suddenly, like a\nhandful of dust caught up by an unexpected gust of wind, through Jean\nValjean's mournful brain. He examined the Cul-de-Sac Genrot; there he\nwas cut off. He examined the Rue Petit-Picpus; there stood a sentinel.\nHe saw that black form standing out in relief against the white\npavement, illuminated by the moon; to advance was to fall into this\nman's hands; to retreat was to fling himself into Javert's arms. Jean\nValjean felt himself caught, as in a net, which was slowly contracting;\nhe gazed heavenward in despair.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV--THE GROPINGS OF FLIGHT\n\nIn order to understand what follows, it is requisite to form an exact\nidea of the Droit-Mur lane, and, in particular, of the angle which one\nleaves on the left when one emerges from the Rue Polonceau into this\nlane. Droit-Mur lane was almost entirely bordered on the right, as far\nas the Rue Petit-Picpus, by houses of mean aspect; on the left by a\nsolitary building of severe outlines, composed of numerous parts which\ngrew gradually higher by a story or two as they approached the Rue\nPetit-Picpus side; so that this building, which was very lofty on the\nRue Petit-Picpus side, was tolerably low on the side adjoining the Rue\nPolonceau. There, at the angle of which we have spoken, it descended to\nsuch a degree that it consisted of merely a wall. This wall did not abut\ndirectly on the Street; it formed a deeply retreating niche, concealed\nby its two corners from two observers who might have been, one in the\nRue Polonceau, the other in the Rue Droit-Mur.\n\nBeginning with these angles of the niche, the wall extended along the\nRue Polonceau as far as a house which bore the number 49, and along the\nRue Droit-Mur, where the fragment was much shorter, as far as the gloomy\nbuilding which we have mentioned and whose gable it intersected, thus\nforming another retreating angle in the street. This gable was sombre\nof aspect; only one window was visible, or, to speak more correctly, two\nshutters covered with a sheet of zinc and kept constantly closed.\n\nThe state of the places of which we are here giving a description is\nrigorously exact, and will certainly awaken a very precise memory in the\nmind of old inhabitants of the quarter.\n\nThe niche was entirely filled by a thing which resembled a colossal\nand wretched door; it was a vast, formless assemblage of perpendicular\nplanks, the upper ones being broader than the lower, bound together by\nlong transverse strips of iron. At one side there was a carriage gate of\nthe ordinary dimensions, and which had evidently not been cut more than\nfifty years previously.\n\nA linden-tree showed its crest above the niche, and the wall was covered\nwith ivy on the side of the Rue Polonceau.\n\nIn the imminent peril in which Jean Valjean found himself, this sombre\nbuilding had about it a solitary and uninhabited look which tempted him.\nHe ran his eyes rapidly over it; he said to himself, that if he could\ncontrive to get inside it, he might save himself. First he conceived an\nidea, then a hope.\n\nIn the central portion of the front of this building, on the Rue\nDroit-Mur side, there were at all the windows of the different stories\nancient cistern pipes of lead. The various branches of the pipes which\nled from one central pipe to all these little basins sketched out a sort\nof tree on the front. These ramifications of pipes with their hundred\nelbows imitated those old leafless vine-stocks which writhe over the\nfronts of old farm-houses.\n\nThis odd espalier, with its branches of lead and iron, was the first\nthing that struck Jean Valjean. He seated Cosette with her back against\na stone post, with an injunction to be silent, and ran to the spot where\nthe conduit touched the pavement. Perhaps there was some way of climbing\nup by it and entering the house. But the pipe was dilapidated and past\nservice, and hardly hung to its fastenings. Moreover, all the windows\nof this silent dwelling were grated with heavy iron bars, even the attic\nwindows in the roof. And then, the moon fell full upon that facade, and\nthe man who was watching at the corner of the street would have seen\nJean Valjean in the act of climbing. And finally, what was to be done\nwith Cosette? How was she to be drawn up to the top of a three-story\nhouse?\n\nHe gave up all idea of climbing by means of the drain-pipe, and crawled\nalong the wall to get back into the Rue Polonceau.\n\nWhen he reached the slant of the wall where he had left Cosette, he\nnoticed that no one could see him there. As we have just explained, he\nwas concealed from all eyes, no matter from which direction they were\napproaching; besides this, he was in the shadow. Finally, there were\ntwo doors; perhaps they might be forced. The wall above which he saw the\nlinden-tree and the ivy evidently abutted on a garden where he could, at\nleast, hide himself, although there were as yet no leaves on the trees,\nand spend the remainder of the night.\n\nTime was passing; he must act quickly.\n\nHe felt over the carriage door, and immediately recognized the fact that\nit was impracticable outside and in.\n\nHe approached the other door with more hope; it was frightfully\ndecrepit; its very immensity rendered it less solid; the planks were\nrotten; the iron bands--there were only three of them--were rusted. It\nseemed as though it might be possible to pierce this worm-eaten barrier.\n\nOn examining it he found that the door was not a door; it had neither\nhinges, cross-bars, lock, nor fissure in the middle; the iron bands\ntraversed it from side to side without any break. Through the crevices\nin the planks he caught a view of unhewn slabs and blocks of stone\nroughly cemented together, which passers-by might still have seen there\nten years ago. He was forced to acknowledge with consternation that this\napparent door was simply the wooden decoration of a building against\nwhich it was placed. It was easy to tear off a plank; but then, one\nfound one's self face to face with a wall.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V--WHICH WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE WITH GAS LANTERNS\n\nAt that moment a heavy and measured sound began to be audible at some\ndistance. Jean Valjean risked a glance round the corner of the street.\nSeven or eight soldiers, drawn up in a platoon, had just debouched\ninto the Rue Polonceau. He saw the gleam of their bayonets. They were\nadvancing towards him; these soldiers, at whose head he distinguished\nJavert's tall figure, advanced slowly and cautiously. They halted\nfrequently; it was plain that they were searching all the nooks of the\nwalls and all the embrasures of the doors and alleys.\n\nThis was some patrol that Javert had encountered--there could be no\nmistake as to this surmise--and whose aid he had demanded.\n\nJavert's two acolytes were marching in their ranks.\n\nAt the rate at which they were marching, and in consideration of the\nhalts which they were making, it would take them about a quarter of\nan hour to reach the spot where Jean Valjean stood. It was a frightful\nmoment. A few minutes only separated Jean Valjean from that terrible\nprecipice which yawned before him for the third time. And the galleys\nnow meant not only the galleys, but Cosette lost to him forever; that is\nto say, a life resembling the interior of a tomb.\n\nThere was but one thing which was possible.\n\nJean Valjean had this peculiarity, that he carried, as one might say,\ntwo beggar's pouches: in one he kept his saintly thoughts; in the other\nthe redoubtable talents of a convict. He rummaged in the one or the\nother, according to circumstances.\n\nAmong his other resources, thanks to his numerous escapes from the\nprison at Toulon, he was, as it will be remembered, a past master in the\nincredible art of crawling up without ladder or climbing-irons, by sheer\nmuscular force, by leaning on the nape of his neck, his shoulders, his\nhips, and his knees, by helping himself on the rare projections of the\nstone, in the right angle of a wall, as high as the sixth story, if need\nbe; an art which has rendered so celebrated and so alarming that corner\nof the wall of the Conciergerie of Paris by which Battemolle, condemned\nto death, made his escape twenty years ago.\n\nJean Valjean measured with his eyes the wall above which he espied the\nlinden; it was about eighteen feet in height. The angle which it formed\nwith the gable of the large building was filled, at its lower extremity,\nby a mass of masonry of a triangular shape, probably intended to\npreserve that too convenient corner from the rubbish of those dirty\ncreatures called the passers-by. This practice of filling up corners of\nthe wall is much in use in Paris.\n\nThis mass was about five feet in height; the space above the summit of\nthis mass which it was necessary to climb was not more than fourteen\nfeet.\n\nThe wall was surmounted by a flat stone without a coping.\n\nCosette was the difficulty, for she did not know how to climb a wall.\nShould he abandon her? Jean Valjean did not once think of that. It\nwas impossible to carry her. A man's whole strength is required to\nsuccessfully carry out these singular ascents. The least burden would\ndisturb his centre of gravity and pull him downwards.\n\nA rope would have been required; Jean Valjean had none. Where was he to\nget a rope at midnight, in the Rue Polonceau? Certainly, if Jean Valjean\nhad had a kingdom, he would have given it for a rope at that moment.\n\nAll extreme situations have their lightning flashes which sometimes\ndazzle, sometimes illuminate us.\n\nJean Valjean's despairing glance fell on the street lantern-post of the\nblind alley Genrot.\n\nAt that epoch there were no gas-jets in the streets of Paris. At\nnightfall lanterns placed at regular distances were lighted; they were\nascended and descended by means of a rope, which traversed the street\nfrom side to side, and was adjusted in a groove of the post. The pulley\nover which this rope ran was fastened underneath the lantern in a little\niron box, the key to which was kept by the lamp-lighter, and the rope\nitself was protected by a metal case.\n\nJean Valjean, with the energy of a supreme struggle, crossed the street\nat one bound, entered the blind alley, broke the latch of the little box\nwith the point of his knife, and an instant later he was beside Cosette\nonce more. He had a rope. These gloomy inventors of expedients work\nrapidly when they are fighting against fatality.\n\nWe have already explained that the lanterns had not been lighted that\nnight. The lantern in the Cul-de-Sac Genrot was thus naturally extinct,\nlike the rest; and one could pass directly under it without even\nnoticing that it was no longer in its place.\n\nNevertheless, the hour, the place, the darkness, Jean Valjean's\nabsorption, his singular gestures, his goings and comings, all had begun\nto render Cosette uneasy. Any other child than she would have given vent\nto loud shrieks long before. She contented herself with plucking Jean\nValjean by the skirt of his coat. They could hear the sound of the\npatrol's approach ever more and more distinctly.\n\n\"Father,\" said she, in a very low voice, \"I am afraid. Who is coming\nyonder?\"\n\n\"Hush!\" replied the unhappy man; \"it is Madame Thenardier.\"\n\nCosette shuddered. He added:--\n\n\"Say nothing. Don't interfere with me. If you cry out, if you weep, the\nThenardier is lying in wait for you. She is coming to take you back.\"\n\nThen, without haste, but without making a useless movement, with firm\nand curt precision, the more remarkable at a moment when the patrol and\nJavert might come upon him at any moment, he undid his cravat, passed it\nround Cosette's body under the armpits, taking care that it should not\nhurt the child, fastened this cravat to one end of the rope, by means of\nthat knot which seafaring men call a \"swallow knot,\" took the other end\nof the rope in his teeth, pulled off his shoes and stockings, which\nhe threw over the wall, stepped upon the mass of masonry, and began\nto raise himself in the angle of the wall and the gable with as much\nsolidity and certainty as though he had the rounds of a ladder under his\nfeet and elbows. Half a minute had not elapsed when he was resting on\nhis knees on the wall.\n\nCosette gazed at him in stupid amazement, without uttering a word. Jean\nValjean's injunction, and the name of Madame Thenardier, had chilled her\nblood.\n\nAll at once she heard Jean Valjean's voice crying to her, though in a\nvery low tone:--\n\n\"Put your back against the wall.\"\n\nShe obeyed.\n\n\"Don't say a word, and don't be alarmed,\" went on Jean Valjean.\n\nAnd she felt herself lifted from the ground.\n\nBefore she had time to recover herself, she was on the top of the wall.\n\nJean Valjean grasped her, put her on his back, took her two tiny hands\nin his large left hand, lay down flat on his stomach and crawled along\non top of the wall as far as the cant. As he had guessed, there stood\na building whose roof started from the top of the wooden barricade and\ndescended to within a very short distance of the ground, with a gentle\nslope which grazed the linden-tree. A lucky circumstance, for the wall\nwas much higher on this side than on the street side. Jean Valjean could\nonly see the ground at a great depth below him.\n\nHe had just reached the slope of the roof, and had not yet left the\ncrest of the wall, when a violent uproar announced the arrival of the\npatrol. The thundering voice of Javert was audible:--\n\n\"Search the blind alley! The Rue Droit-Mur is guarded! so is the Rue\nPetit-Picpus. I'll answer for it that he is in the blind alley.\"\n\nThe soldiers rushed into the Genrot alley.\n\nJean Valjean allowed himself to slide down the roof, still holding fast\nto Cosette, reached the linden-tree, and leaped to the ground. Whether\nfrom terror or courage, Cosette had not breathed a sound, though her\nhands were a little abraded.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI--THE BEGINNING OF AN ENIGMA\n\nJean Valjean found himself in a sort of garden which was very vast and\nof singular aspect; one of those melancholy gardens which seem made to\nbe looked at in winter and at night. This garden was oblong in shape,\nwith an alley of large poplars at the further end, tolerably tall forest\ntrees in the corners, and an unshaded space in the centre, where could\nbe seen a very large, solitary tree, then several fruit-trees, gnarled\nand bristling like bushes, beds of vegetables, a melon patch, whose\nglass frames sparkled in the moonlight, and an old well. Here and\nthere stood stone benches which seemed black with moss. The alleys were\nbordered with gloomy and very erect little shrubs. The grass had half\ntaken possession of them, and a green mould covered the rest.\n\nJean Valjean had beside him the building whose roof had served him as\na means of descent, a pile of fagots, and, behind the fagots, directly\nagainst the wall, a stone statue, whose mutilated face was no longer\nanything more than a shapeless mask which loomed vaguely through the\ngloom.\n\nThe building was a sort of ruin, where dismantled chambers were\ndistinguishable, one of which, much encumbered, seemed to serve as a\nshed.\n\nThe large building of the Rue Droit-Mur, which had a wing on the Rue\nPetit-Picpus, turned two facades, at right angles, towards this garden.\nThese interior facades were even more tragic than the exterior. All\nthe windows were grated. Not a gleam of light was visible at any one of\nthem. The upper story had scuttles like prisons. One of those facades\ncast its shadow on the other, which fell over the garden like an immense\nblack pall.\n\nNo other house was visible. The bottom of the garden was lost in mist\nand darkness. Nevertheless, walls could be confusedly made out, which\nintersected as though there were more cultivated land beyond, and the\nlow roofs of the Rue Polonceau.\n\nNothing more wild and solitary than this garden could be imagined. There\nwas no one in it, which was quite natural in view of the hour; but it\ndid not seem as though this spot were made for any one to walk in, even\nin broad daylight.\n\nJean Valjean's first care had been to get hold of his shoes and put them\non again, then to step under the shed with Cosette. A man who is fleeing\nnever thinks himself sufficiently hidden. The child, whose thoughts were\nstill on the Thenardier, shared his instinct for withdrawing from sight\nas much as possible.\n\nCosette trembled and pressed close to him. They heard the tumultuous\nnoise of the patrol searching the blind alley and the streets; the blows\nof their gun-stocks against the stones; Javert's appeals to the police\nspies whom he had posted, and his imprecations mingled with words which\ncould not be distinguished.\n\nAt the expiration of a quarter of an hour it seemed as though that\nspecies of stormy roar were becoming more distant. Jean Valjean held his\nbreath.\n\nHe had laid his hand lightly on Cosette's mouth.\n\nHowever, the solitude in which he stood was so strangely calm, that this\nfrightful uproar, close and furious as it was, did not disturb him by so\nmuch as the shadow of a misgiving. It seemed as though those walls had\nbeen built of the deaf stones of which the Scriptures speak.\n\nAll at once, in the midst of this profound calm, a fresh sound arose; a\nsound as celestial, divine, ineffable, ravishing, as the other had been\nhorrible. It was a hymn which issued from the gloom, a dazzling burst\nof prayer and harmony in the obscure and alarming silence of the night;\nwomen's voices, but voices composed at one and the same time of the pure\naccents of virgins and the innocent accents of children,--voices which\nare not of the earth, and which resemble those that the newborn infant\nstill hears, and which the dying man hears already. This song proceeded\nfrom the gloomy edifice which towered above the garden. At the moment\nwhen the hubbub of demons retreated, one would have said that a choir of\nangels was approaching through the gloom.\n\nCosette and Jean Valjean fell on their knees.\n\nThey knew not what it was, they knew not where they were; but both of\nthem, the man and the child, the penitent and the innocent, felt that\nthey must kneel.\n\nThese voices had this strange characteristic, that they did not prevent\nthe building from seeming to be deserted. It was a supernatural chant in\nan uninhabited house.\n\nWhile these voices were singing, Jean Valjean thought of nothing. He no\nlonger beheld the night; he beheld a blue sky. It seemed to him that he\nfelt those wings which we all have within us, unfolding.\n\nThe song died away. It may have lasted a long time. Jean Valjean could\nnot have told. Hours of ecstasy are never more than a moment.\n\nAll fell silent again. There was no longer anything in the street;\nthere was nothing in the garden. That which had menaced, that which had\nreassured him,--all had vanished. The breeze swayed a few dry weeds\non the crest of the wall, and they gave out a faint, sweet, melancholy\nsound.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII--CONTINUATION OF THE ENIGMA\n\nThe night wind had risen, which indicated that it must be between one\nand two o'clock in the morning. Poor Cosette said nothing. As she had\nseated herself beside him and leaned her head against him, Jean Valjean\nhad fancied that she was asleep. He bent down and looked at her.\nCosette's eyes were wide open, and her thoughtful air pained Jean\nValjean.\n\nShe was still trembling.\n\n\"Are you sleepy?\" said Jean Valjean.\n\n\"I am very cold,\" she replied.\n\nA moment later she resumed:--\n\n\"Is she still there?\"\n\n\"Who?\" said Jean Valjean.\n\n\"Madame Thenardier.\"\n\nJean Valjean had already forgotten the means which he had employed to\nmake Cosette keep silent.\n\n\"Ah!\" said he, \"she is gone. You need fear nothing further.\"\n\nThe child sighed as though a load had been lifted from her breast.\n\nThe ground was damp, the shed open on all sides, the breeze grew more\nkeen every instant. The goodman took off his coat and wrapped it round\nCosette.\n\n\"Are you less cold now?\" said he.\n\n\"Oh, yes, father.\"\n\n\"Well, wait for me a moment. I will soon be back.\"\n\nHe quitted the ruin and crept along the large building, seeking a better\nshelter. He came across doors, but they were closed. There were bars at\nall the windows of the ground floor.\n\nJust after he had turned the inner angle of the edifice, he observed\nthat he was coming to some arched windows, where he perceived a light.\nHe stood on tiptoe and peeped through one of these windows. They all\nopened on a tolerably vast hall, paved with large flagstones, cut up\nby arcades and pillars, where only a tiny light and great shadows were\nvisible. The light came from a taper which was burning in one\ncorner. The apartment was deserted, and nothing was stirring in it.\nNevertheless, by dint of gazing intently he thought he perceived on the\nground something which appeared to be covered with a winding-sheet, and\nwhich resembled a human form. This form was lying face downward, flat\non the pavement, with the arms extended in the form of a cross, in the\nimmobility of death. One would have said, judging from a sort of serpent\nwhich undulated over the floor, that this sinister form had a rope round\nits neck.\n\nThe whole chamber was bathed in that mist of places which are sparely\nilluminated, which adds to horror.\n\nJean Valjean often said afterwards, that, although many funereal\nspectres had crossed his path in life, he had never beheld anything more\nblood-curdling and terrible than that enigmatical form accomplishing\nsome inexplicable mystery in that gloomy place, and beheld thus at\nnight. It was alarming to suppose that that thing was perhaps dead; and\nstill more alarming to think that it was perhaps alive.\n\nHe had the courage to plaster his face to the glass, and to watch\nwhether the thing would move. In spite of his remaining thus what seemed\nto him a very long time, the outstretched form made no movement. All\nat once he felt himself overpowered by an inexpressible terror, and he\nfled. He began to run towards the shed, not daring to look behind him.\nIt seemed to him, that if he turned his head, he should see that form\nfollowing him with great strides and waving its arms.\n\nHe reached the ruin all out of breath. His knees were giving way beneath\nhim; the perspiration was pouring from him.\n\nWhere was he? Who could ever have imagined anything like that sort of\nsepulchre in the midst of Paris! What was this strange house? An edifice\nfull of nocturnal mystery, calling to souls through the darkness with\nthe voice of angels, and when they came, offering them abruptly that\nterrible vision; promising to open the radiant portals of heaven, and\nthen opening the horrible gates of the tomb! And it actually was an\nedifice, a house, which bore a number on the street! It was not a dream!\nHe had to touch the stones to convince himself that such was the fact.\n\nCold, anxiety, uneasiness, the emotions of the night, had given him a\ngenuine fever, and all these ideas were clashing together in his brain.\n\nHe stepped up to Cosette. She was asleep.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII--THE ENIGMA BECOMES DOUBLY MYSTERIOUS\n\nThe child had laid her head on a stone and fallen asleep.\n\nHe sat down beside her and began to think. Little by little, as he gazed\nat her, he grew calm and regained possession of his freedom of mind.\n\nHe clearly perceived this truth, the foundation of his life henceforth,\nthat so long as she was there, so long as he had her near him, he should\nneed nothing except for her, he should fear nothing except for her. He\nwas not even conscious that he was very cold, since he had taken off his\ncoat to cover her.\n\nNevertheless, athwart this revery into which he had fallen he had heard\nfor some time a peculiar noise. It was like the tinkling of a bell. This\nsound proceeded from the garden. It could be heard distinctly though\nfaintly. It resembled the faint, vague music produced by the bells of\ncattle at night in the pastures.\n\nThis noise made Valjean turn round.\n\nHe looked and saw that there was some one in the garden.\n\nA being resembling a man was walking amid the bell-glasses of the melon\nbeds, rising, stooping, halting, with regular movements, as though he\nwere dragging or spreading out something on the ground. This person\nappeared to limp.\n\nJean Valjean shuddered with the continual tremor of the unhappy. For\nthem everything is hostile and suspicious. They distrust the day\nbecause it enables people to see them, and the night because it aids\nin surprising them. A little while before he had shivered because the\ngarden was deserted, and now he shivered because there was some one\nthere.\n\nHe fell back from chimerical terrors to real terrors. He said to himself\nthat Javert and the spies had, perhaps, not taken their departure; that\nthey had, no doubt, left people on the watch in the street; that if this\nman should discover him in the garden, he would cry out for help against\nthieves and deliver him up. He took the sleeping Cosette gently in his\narms and carried her behind a heap of old furniture, which was out of\nuse, in the most remote corner of the shed. Cosette did not stir.\n\nFrom that point he scrutinized the appearance of the being in the\nmelon patch. The strange thing about it was, that the sound of the bell\nfollowed each of this man's movements. When the man approached, the\nsound approached; when the man retreated, the sound retreated; if he\nmade any hasty gesture, a tremolo accompanied the gesture; when he\nhalted, the sound ceased. It appeared evident that the bell was attached\nto that man; but what could that signify? Who was this man who had a\nbell suspended about him like a ram or an ox?\n\nAs he put these questions to himself, he touched Cosette's hands. They\nwere icy cold.\n\n\"Ah! good God!\" he cried.\n\nHe spoke to her in a low voice:--\n\n\"Cosette!\"\n\nShe did not open her eyes.\n\nHe shook her vigorously.\n\nShe did not wake.\n\n\"Is she dead?\" he said to himself, and sprang to his feet, quivering\nfrom head to foot.\n\nThe most frightful thoughts rushed pell-mell through his mind. There\nare moments when hideous surmises assail us like a cohort of furies, and\nviolently force the partitions of our brains. When those we love are in\nquestion, our prudence invents every sort of madness. He remembered that\nsleep in the open air on a cold night may be fatal.\n\nCosette was pale, and had fallen at full length on the ground at his\nfeet, without a movement.\n\nHe listened to her breathing: she still breathed, but with a respiration\nwhich seemed to him weak and on the point of extinction.\n\n\nHow was he to warm her back to life? How was he to rouse her? All that\nwas not connected with this vanished from his thoughts. He rushed wildly\nfrom the ruin.\n\nIt was absolutely necessary that Cosette should be in bed and beside a\nfire in less than a quarter of an hour.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX--THE MAN WITH THE BELL\n\nHe walked straight up to the man whom he saw in the garden. He had taken\nin his hand the roll of silver which was in the pocket of his waistcoat.\n\nThe man's head was bent down, and he did not see him approaching. In a\nfew strides Jean Valjean stood beside him.\n\nJean Valjean accosted him with the cry:--\n\n\"One hundred francs!\"\n\nThe man gave a start and raised his eyes.\n\n\"You can earn a hundred francs,\" went on Jean Valjean, \"if you will\ngrant me shelter for this night.\"\n\nThe moon shone full upon Jean Valjean's terrified countenance.\n\n\"What! so it is you, Father Madeleine!\" said the man.\n\nThat name, thus pronounced, at that obscure hour, in that unknown spot,\nby that strange man, made Jean Valjean start back.\n\nHe had expected anything but that. The person who thus addressed him was\na bent and lame old man, dressed almost like a peasant, who wore on his\nleft knee a leather knee-cap, whence hung a moderately large bell. His\nface, which was in the shadow, was not distinguishable.\n\nHowever, the goodman had removed his cap, and exclaimed, trembling all\nover:--\n\n\"Ah, good God! How come you here, Father Madeleine? Where did you enter?\nDieu-Jesus! Did you fall from heaven? There is no trouble about that:\nif ever you do fall, it will be from there. And what a state you are in!\nYou have no cravat; you have no hat; you have no coat! Do you know, you\nwould have frightened any one who did not know you? No coat! Lord God!\nAre the saints going mad nowadays? But how did you get in here?\"\n\nHis words tumbled over each other. The goodman talked with a rustic\nvolubility, in which there was nothing alarming. All this was uttered\nwith a mixture of stupefaction and naive kindliness.\n\n\"Who are you? and what house is this?\" demanded Jean Valjean.\n\n\"Ah! pardieu, this is too much!\" exclaimed the old man. \"I am the person\nfor whom you got the place here, and this house is the one where you had\nme placed. What! You don't recognize me?\"\n\n\"No,\" said Jean Valjean; \"and how happens it that you know me?\"\n\n\"You saved my life,\" said the man.\n\nHe turned. A ray of moonlight outlined his profile, and Jean Valjean\nrecognized old Fauchelevent.\n\n\"Ah!\" said Jean Valjean, \"so it is you? Yes, I recollect you.\"\n\n\"That is very lucky,\" said the old man, in a reproachful tone.\n\n\"And what are you doing here?\" resumed Jean Valjean.\n\n\"Why, I am covering my melons, of course!\"\n\nIn fact, at the moment when Jean Valjean accosted him, old Fauchelevent\nheld in his hand the end of a straw mat which he was occupied in\nspreading over the melon bed. During the hour or thereabouts that he had\nbeen in the garden he had already spread out a number of them. It was\nthis operation which had caused him to execute the peculiar movements\nobserved from the shed by Jean Valjean.\n\nHe continued:--\n\n\"I said to myself, 'The moon is bright: it is going to freeze. What if I\nwere to put my melons into their greatcoats?' And,\" he added, looking at\nJean Valjean with a broad smile,--\"pardieu! you ought to have done the\nsame! But how do you come here?\"\n\nJean Valjean, finding himself known to this man, at least only under the\nname of Madeleine, thenceforth advanced only with caution. He multiplied\nhis questions. Strange to say, their roles seemed to be reversed. It was\nhe, the intruder, who interrogated.\n\n\"And what is this bell which you wear on your knee?\"\n\n\"This,\" replied Fauchelevent, \"is so that I may be avoided.\"\n\n\"What! so that you may be avoided?\"\n\nOld Fauchelevent winked with an indescribable air.\n\n\"Ah, goodness! there are only women in this house--many young girls. It\nappears that I should be a dangerous person to meet. The bell gives them\nwarning. When I come, they go.\"\n\n\"What house is this?\"\n\n\"Come, you know well enough.\"\n\n\"But I do not.\"\n\n\"Not when you got me the place here as gardener?\"\n\n\"Answer me as though I knew nothing.\"\n\n\"Well, then, this is the Petit-Picpus convent.\"\n\nMemories recurred to Jean Valjean. Chance, that is to say, Providence,\nhad cast him into precisely that convent in the Quartier Saint-Antoine\nwhere old Fauchelevent, crippled by the fall from his cart, had been\nadmitted on his recommendation two years previously. He repeated, as\nthough talking to himself:--\n\n\"The Petit-Picpus convent.\"\n\n\"Exactly,\" returned old Fauchelevent. \"But to come to the point, how the\ndeuce did you manage to get in here, you, Father Madeleine? No matter if\nyou are a saint; you are a man as well, and no man enters here.\"\n\n\"You certainly are here.\"\n\n\"There is no one but me.\"\n\n\"Still,\" said Jean Valjean, \"I must stay here.\"\n\n\"Ah, good God!\" cried Fauchelevent.\n\nJean Valjean drew near to the old man, and said to him in a grave\nvoice:--\n\n\"Father Fauchelevent, I saved your life.\"\n\n\"I was the first to recall it,\" returned Fauchelevent.\n\n\"Well, you can do to-day for me that which I did for you in the olden\ndays.\"\n\nFauchelevent took in his aged, trembling, and wrinkled hands Jean\nValjean's two robust hands, and stood for several minutes as though\nincapable of speaking. At length he exclaimed:--\n\n\"Oh! that would be a blessing from the good God, if I could make you\nsome little return for that! Save your life! Monsieur le Maire, dispose\nof the old man!\"\n\nA wonderful joy had transfigured this old man. His countenance seemed to\nemit a ray of light.\n\n\"What do you wish me to do?\" he resumed.\n\n\"That I will explain to you. You have a chamber?\"\n\n\"I have an isolated hovel yonder, behind the ruins of the old convent,\nin a corner which no one ever looks into. There are three rooms in it.\"\n\nThe hut was, in fact, so well hidden behind the ruins, and so cleverly\narranged to prevent it being seen, that Jean Valjean had not perceived\nit.\n\n\"Good,\" said Jean Valjean. \"Now I am going to ask two things of you.\"\n\n\"What are they, Mr. Mayor?\"\n\n\"In the first place, you are not to tell any one what you know about me.\nIn the second, you are not to try to find out anything more.\"\n\n\"As you please. I know that you can do nothing that is not honest,\nthat you have always been a man after the good God's heart. And then,\nmoreover, you it was who placed me here. That concerns you. I am at your\nservice.\"\n\n\"That is settled then. Now, come with me. We will go and get the child.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" said Fauchelevent, \"so there is a child?\"\n\nHe added not a word further, and followed Jean Valjean as a dog follows\nhis master.\n\nLess than half an hour afterwards Cosette, who had grown rosy again\nbefore the flame of a good fire, was lying asleep in the old gardener's\nbed. Jean Valjean had put on his cravat and coat once more; his hat,\nwhich he had flung over the wall, had been found and picked up. While\nJean Valjean was putting on his coat, Fauchelevent had removed the\nbell and kneecap, which now hung on a nail beside a vintage basket that\nadorned the wall. The two men were warming themselves with their elbows\nresting on a table upon which Fauchelevent had placed a bit of cheese,\nblack bread, a bottle of wine, and two glasses, and the old man was\nsaying to Jean Valjean, as he laid his hand on the latter's knee:\n\"Ah! Father Madeleine! You did not recognize me immediately; you save\npeople's lives, and then you forget them! That is bad! But they remember\nyou! You are an ingrate!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X--WHICH EXPLAINS HOW JAVERT GOT ON THE SCENT\n\nThe events of which we have just beheld the reverse side, so to speak,\nhad come about in the simplest possible manner.\n\nWhen Jean Valjean, on the evening of the very day when Javert had\narrested him beside Fantine's death-bed, had escaped from the town jail\nof M. sur M., the police had supposed that he had betaken himself to\nParis. Paris is a maelstrom where everything is lost, and everything\ndisappears in this belly of the world, as in the belly of the sea. No\nforest hides a man as does that crowd. Fugitives of every sort know\nthis. They go to Paris as to an abyss; there are gulfs which save. The\npolice know it also, and it is in Paris that they seek what they\nhave lost elsewhere. They sought the ex-mayor of M. sur M. Javert was\nsummoned to Paris to throw light on their researches. Javert had, in\nfact, rendered powerful assistance in the recapture of Jean Valjean.\nJavert's zeal and intelligence on that occasion had been remarked by\nM. Chabouillet, secretary of the Prefecture under Comte Angles. M.\nChabouillet, who had, moreover, already been Javert's patron, had the\ninspector of M. sur M. attached to the police force of Paris. There\nJavert rendered himself useful in divers and, though the word may seem\nstrange for such services, honorable manners.\n\nHe no longer thought of Jean Valjean,--the wolf of to-day causes these\ndogs who are always on the chase to forget the wolf of yesterday,--when,\nin December, 1823, he read a newspaper, he who never read newspapers;\nbut Javert, a monarchical man, had a desire to know the particulars of\nthe triumphal entry of the \"Prince Generalissimo\" into Bayonne. Just as\nhe was finishing the article, which interested him; a name, the name of\nJean Valjean, attracted his attention at the bottom of a page. The paper\nannounced that the convict Jean Valjean was dead, and published the fact\nin such formal terms that Javert did not doubt it. He confined himself\nto the remark, \"That's a good entry.\" Then he threw aside the paper, and\nthought no more about it.\n\nSome time afterwards, it chanced that a police report was transmitted\nfrom the prefecture of the Seine-et-Oise to the prefecture of police in\nParis, concerning the abduction of a child, which had taken place, under\npeculiar circumstances, as it was said, in the commune of Montfermeil.\nA little girl of seven or eight years of age, the report said, who had\nbeen intrusted by her mother to an inn-keeper of that neighborhood, had\nbeen stolen by a stranger; this child answered to the name of Cosette,\nand was the daughter of a girl named Fantine, who had died in the\nhospital, it was not known where or when.\n\nThis report came under Javert's eye and set him to thinking.\n\nThe name of Fantine was well known to him. He remembered that Jean\nValjean had made him, Javert, burst into laughter, by asking him for a\nrespite of three days, for the purpose of going to fetch that creature's\nchild. He recalled the fact that Jean Valjean had been arrested in Paris\nat the very moment when he was stepping into the coach for Montfermeil.\nSome signs had made him suspect at the time that this was the second\noccasion of his entering that coach, and that he had already, on the\nprevious day, made an excursion to the neighborhood of that village, for\nhe had not been seen in the village itself. What had he been intending\nto do in that region of Montfermeil? It could not even be surmised.\nJavert understood it now. Fantine's daughter was there. Jean Valjean was\ngoing there in search of her. And now this child had been stolen by a\nstranger! Who could that stranger be? Could it be Jean Valjean? But Jean\nValjean was dead. Javert, without saying anything to anybody, took the\ncoach from the Pewter Platter, Cul-de-Sac de la Planchette, and made a\ntrip to Montfermeil.\n\nHe expected to find a great deal of light on the subject there; he found\na great deal of obscurity.\n\nFor the first few days the Thenardiers had chattered in their rage. The\ndisappearance of the Lark had created a sensation in the village. He\nimmediately obtained numerous versions of the story, which ended in the\nabduction of a child. Hence the police report. But their first vexation\nhaving passed off, Thenardier, with his wonderful instinct, had\nvery quickly comprehended that it is never advisable to stir up the\nprosecutor of the Crown, and that his complaints with regard to the\nabduction of Cosette would have as their first result to fix upon\nhimself, and upon many dark affairs which he had on hand, the glittering\neye of justice. The last thing that owls desire is to have a candle\nbrought to them. And in the first place, how explain the fifteen hundred\nfrancs which he had received? He turned squarely round, put a gag on\nhis wife's mouth, and feigned astonishment when the stolen child was\nmentioned to him. He understood nothing about it; no doubt he had\ngrumbled for awhile at having that dear little creature \"taken from him\"\nso hastily; he should have liked to keep her two or three days longer,\nout of tenderness; but her \"grandfather\" had come for her in the most\nnatural way in the world. He added the \"grandfather,\" which produced a\ngood effect. This was the story that Javert hit upon when he arrived at\nMontfermeil. The grandfather caused Jean Valjean to vanish.\n\nNevertheless, Javert dropped a few questions, like plummets, into\nThenardier's history. \"Who was that grandfather? and what was his name?\"\nThenardier replied with simplicity: \"He is a wealthy farmer. I saw his\npassport. I think his name was M. Guillaume Lambert.\"\n\nLambert is a respectable and extremely reassuring name. Thereupon Javert\nreturned to Paris.\n\n\"Jean Valjean is certainly dead,\" said he, \"and I am a ninny.\"\n\nHe had again begun to forget this history, when, in the course of\nMarch, 1824, he heard of a singular personage who dwelt in the parish of\nSaint-Medard and who had been surnamed \"the mendicant who gives alms.\"\nThis person, the story ran, was a man of means, whose name no one knew\nexactly, and who lived alone with a little girl of eight years, who\nknew nothing about herself, save that she had come from Montfermeil.\nMontfermeil! that name was always coming up, and it made Javert prick\nup his ears. An old beggar police spy, an ex-beadle, to whom this person\nhad given alms, added a few more details. This gentleman of property was\nvery shy,--never coming out except in the evening, speaking to no one,\nexcept, occasionally to the poor, and never allowing any one to approach\nhim. He wore a horrible old yellow frock-coat, which was worth many\nmillions, being all wadded with bank-bills. This piqued Javert's\ncuriosity in a decided manner. In order to get a close look at this\nfantastic gentleman without alarming him, he borrowed the beadle's\noutfit for a day, and the place where the old spy was in the habit of\ncrouching every evening, whining orisons through his nose, and playing\nthe spy under cover of prayer.\n\n\"The suspected individual\" did indeed approach Javert thus disguised,\nand bestow alms on him. At that moment Javert raised his head, and the\nshock which Jean Valjean received on recognizing Javert was equal to the\none received by Javert when he thought he recognized Jean Valjean.\n\nHowever, the darkness might have misled him; Jean Valjean's death was\nofficial; Javert cherished very grave doubts; and when in doubt, Javert,\nthe man of scruples, never laid a finger on any one's collar.\n\nHe followed his man to the Gorbeau house, and got \"the old woman\" to\ntalking, which was no difficult matter. The old woman confirmed the fact\nregarding the coat lined with millions, and narrated to him the episode\nof the thousand-franc bill. She had seen it! She had handled it! Javert\nhired a room; that evening he installed himself in it. He came and\nlistened at the mysterious lodger's door, hoping to catch the sound of\nhis voice, but Jean Valjean saw his candle through the key-hole, and\nfoiled the spy by keeping silent.\n\nOn the following day Jean Valjean decamped; but the noise made by the\nfall of the five-franc piece was noticed by the old woman, who, hearing\nthe rattling of coin, suspected that he might be intending to leave, and\nmade haste to warn Javert. At night, when Jean Valjean came out, Javert\nwas waiting for him behind the trees of the boulevard with two men.\n\nJavert had demanded assistance at the Prefecture, but he had not\nmentioned the name of the individual whom he hoped to seize; that was\nhis secret, and he had kept it for three reasons: in the first place,\nbecause the slightest indiscretion might put Jean Valjean on the alert;\nnext, because, to lay hands on an ex-convict who had made his escape\nand was reputed dead, on a criminal whom justice had formerly classed\nforever as among malefactors of the most dangerous sort, was a\nmagnificent success which the old members of the Parisian police would\nassuredly not leave to a new-comer like Javert, and he was afraid of\nbeing deprived of his convict; and lastly, because Javert, being an\nartist, had a taste for the unforeseen. He hated those well-heralded\nsuccesses which are talked of long in advance and have had the bloom\nbrushed off. He preferred to elaborate his masterpieces in the dark and\nto unveil them suddenly at the last.\n\nJavert had followed Jean Valjean from tree to tree, then from corner\nto corner of the street, and had not lost sight of him for a single\ninstant; even at the moments when Jean Valjean believed himself to\nbe the most secure Javert's eye had been on him. Why had not Javert\narrested Jean Valjean? Because he was still in doubt.\n\nIt must be remembered that at that epoch the police was not precisely\nat its ease; the free press embarrassed it; several arbitrary arrests\ndenounced by the newspapers, had echoed even as far as the Chambers, and\nhad rendered the Prefecture timid. Interference with individual liberty\nwas a grave matter. The police agents were afraid of making a mistake;\nthe prefect laid the blame on them; a mistake meant dismissal. The\nreader can imagine the effect which this brief paragraph, reproduced\nby twenty newspapers, would have caused in Paris: \"Yesterday, an aged\ngrandfather, with white hair, a respectable and well-to-do gentleman,\nwho was walking with his grandchild, aged eight, was arrested and\nconducted to the agency of the Prefecture as an escaped convict!\"\n\nLet us repeat in addition that Javert had scruples of his own;\ninjunctions of his conscience were added to the injunctions of the\nprefect. He was really in doubt.\n\nJean Valjean turned his back on him and walked in the dark.\n\nSadness, uneasiness, anxiety, depression, this fresh misfortune of being\nforced to flee by night, to seek a chance refuge in Paris for Cosette\nand himself, the necessity of regulating his pace to the pace of\nthe child--all this, without his being aware of it, had altered Jean\nValjean's walk, and impressed on his bearing such senility, that the\npolice themselves, incarnate in the person of Javert, might, and did in\nfact, make a mistake. The impossibility of approaching too close, his\ncostume of an emigre preceptor, the declaration of Thenardier which made\na grandfather of him, and, finally, the belief in his death in prison,\nadded still further to the uncertainty which gathered thick in Javert's\nmind.\n\nFor an instant it occurred to him to make an abrupt demand for his\npapers; but if the man was not Jean Valjean, and if this man was not a\ngood, honest old fellow living on his income, he was probably some merry\nblade deeply and cunningly implicated in the obscure web of Parisian\nmisdeeds, some chief of a dangerous band, who gave alms to conceal\nhis other talents, which was an old dodge. He had trusty fellows,\naccomplices' retreats in case of emergencies, in which he would, no\ndoubt, take refuge. All these turns which he was making through the\nstreets seemed to indicate that he was not a simple and honest man. To\narrest him too hastily would be \"to kill the hen that laid the golden\neggs.\" Where was the inconvenience in waiting? Javert was very sure that\nhe would not escape.\n\nThus he proceeded in a tolerably perplexed state of mind, putting to\nhimself a hundred questions about this enigmatical personage.\n\nIt was only quite late in the Rue de Pontoise, that, thanks to the\nbrilliant light thrown from a dram-shop, he decidedly recognized Jean\nValjean.\n\nThere are in this world two beings who give a profound start,--the\nmother who recovers her child and the tiger who recovers his prey.\nJavert gave that profound start.\n\nAs soon as he had positively recognized Jean Valjean, the formidable\nconvict, he perceived that there were only three of them, and he asked\nfor reinforcements at the police station of the Rue de Pontoise. One\nputs on gloves before grasping a thorn cudgel.\n\nThis delay and the halt at the Carrefour Rollin to consult with his\nagents came near causing him to lose the trail. He speedily divined,\nhowever, that Jean Valjean would want to put the river between his\npursuers and himself. He bent his head and reflected like a blood-hound\nwho puts his nose to the ground to make sure that he is on the right\nscent. Javert, with his powerful rectitude of instinct, went straight to\nthe bridge of Austerlitz. A word with the toll-keeper furnished him with\nthe information which he required: \"Have you seen a man with a little\ngirl?\" \"I made him pay two sous,\" replied the toll-keeper. Javert\nreached the bridge in season to see Jean Valjean traverse the small\nilluminated spot on the other side of the water, leading Cosette by\nthe hand. He saw him enter the Rue du Chemin-Vert-Saint-Antoine; he\nremembered the Cul-de-Sac Genrot arranged there like a trap, and of the\nsole exit of the Rue Droit-Mur into the Rue Petit-Picpus. He made sure\nof his back burrows, as huntsmen say; he hastily despatched one of his\nagents, by a roundabout way, to guard that issue. A patrol which was\nreturning to the Arsenal post having passed him, he made a requisition\non it, and caused it to accompany him. In such games soldiers are aces.\nMoreover, the principle is, that in order to get the best of a wild\nboar, one must employ the science of venery and plenty of dogs. These\ncombinations having been effected, feeling that Jean Valjean was caught\nbetween the blind alley Genrot on the right, his agent on the left, and\nhimself, Javert, in the rear, he took a pinch of snuff.\n\nThen he began the game. He experienced one ecstatic and infernal moment;\nhe allowed his man to go on ahead, knowing that he had him safe, but\ndesirous of postponing the moment of arrest as long as possible, happy\nat the thought that he was taken and yet at seeing him free, gloating\nover him with his gaze, with that voluptuousness of the spider which\nallows the fly to flutter, and of the cat which lets the mouse run.\nClaws and talons possess a monstrous sensuality,--the obscure movements\nof the creature imprisoned in their pincers. What a delight this\nstrangling is!\n\nJavert was enjoying himself. The meshes of his net were stoutly knotted.\nHe was sure of success; all he had to do now was to close his hand.\n\nAccompanied as he was, the very idea of resistance was impossible,\nhowever vigorous, energetic, and desperate Jean Valjean might be.\n\n[Illustration: Javert on the Hunt  2b5-10-javert-on-the-hunt]\n\nJavert advanced slowly, sounding, searching on his way all the nooks of\nthe street like so many pockets of thieves.\n\nWhen he reached the centre of the web he found the fly no longer there.\n\nHis exasperation can be imagined.\n\nHe interrogated his sentinel of the Rues Droit-Mur and Petit-Picpus;\nthat agent, who had remained imperturbably at his post, had not seen the\nman pass.\n\nIt sometimes happens that a stag is lost head and horns; that is to\nsay, he escapes although he has the pack on his very heels, and then the\noldest huntsmen know not what to say. Duvivier, Ligniville, and Desprez\nhalt short. In a discomfiture of this sort, Artonge exclaims, \"It was\nnot a stag, but a sorcerer.\" Javert would have liked to utter the same\ncry.\n\nHis disappointment bordered for a moment on despair and rage.\n\nIt is certain that Napoleon made mistakes during the war with Russia,\nthat Alexander committed blunders in the war in India, that Caesar made\nmistakes in the war in Africa, that Cyrus was at fault in the war\nin Scythia, and that Javert blundered in this campaign against Jean\nValjean. He was wrong, perhaps, in hesitating in his recognition of the\nexconvict. The first glance should have sufficed him. He was wrong in\nnot arresting him purely and simply in the old building; he was wrong\nin not arresting him when he positively recognized him in the Rue de\nPontoise. He was wrong in taking counsel with his auxiliaries in the\nfull light of the moon in the Carrefour Rollin. Advice is certainly\nuseful; it is a good thing to know and to interrogate those of the dogs\nwho deserve confidence; but the hunter cannot be too cautious when he is\nchasing uneasy animals like the wolf and the convict. Javert, by taking\ntoo much thought as to how he should set the bloodhounds of the pack on\nthe trail, alarmed the beast by giving him wind of the dart, and so\nmade him run. Above all, he was wrong in that after he had picked up the\nscent again on the bridge of Austerlitz, he played that formidable and\npuerile game of keeping such a man at the end of a thread. He thought\nhimself stronger than he was, and believed that he could play at the\ngame of the mouse and the lion. At the same time, he reckoned himself\nas too weak, when he judged it necessary to obtain reinforcement. Fatal\nprecaution, waste of precious time! Javert committed all these blunders,\nand none the less was one of the cleverest and most correct spies that\never existed. He was, in the full force of the term, what is called in\nvenery a knowing dog. But what is there that is perfect?\n\nGreat strategists have their eclipses.\n\nThe greatest follies are often composed, like the largest ropes, of\na multitude of strands. Take the cable thread by thread, take all the\npetty determining motives separately, and you can break them one after\nthe other, and you say, \"That is all there is of it!\" Braid them, twist\nthem together; the result is enormous: it is Attila hesitating between\nMarcian on the east and Valentinian on the west; it is Hannibal tarrying\nat Capua; it is Danton falling asleep at Arcis-sur-Aube.\n\nHowever that may be, even at the moment when he saw that Jean Valjean\nhad escaped him, Javert did not lose his head. Sure that the convict who\nhad broken his ban could not be far off, he established sentinels, he\norganized traps and ambuscades, and beat the quarter all that night. The\nfirst thing he saw was the disorder in the street lantern whose rope\nhad been cut. A precious sign which, however, led him astray, since it\ncaused him to turn all his researches in the direction of the Cul-de-Sac\nGenrot. In this blind alley there were tolerably low walls which abutted\non gardens whose bounds adjoined the immense stretches of waste land.\nJean Valjean evidently must have fled in that direction. The fact is,\nthat had he penetrated a little further in the Cul-de-Sac Genrot, he\nwould probably have done so and have been lost. Javert explored these\ngardens and these waste stretches as though he had been hunting for a\nneedle.\n\nAt daybreak he left two intelligent men on the outlook, and returned to\nthe Prefecture of Police, as much ashamed as a police spy who had been\ncaptured by a robber might have been.\n\n\n\n\nBOOK SIXTH.--LE PETIT-PICPUS\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I--NUMBER 62 RUE PETIT-PICPUS\n\nNothing, half a century ago, more resembled every other carriage gate\nthan the carriage gate of Number 62 Rue Petit-Picpus. This entrance,\nwhich usually stood ajar in the most inviting fashion, permitted a\nview of two things, neither of which have anything very funereal about\nthem,--a courtyard surrounded by walls hung with vines, and the face\nof a lounging porter. Above the wall, at the bottom of the court, tall\ntrees were visible. When a ray of sunlight enlivened the courtyard, when\na glass of wine cheered up the porter, it was difficult to pass Number\n62 Little Picpus Street without carrying away a smiling impression of\nit. Nevertheless, it was a sombre place of which one had had a glimpse.\n\nThe threshold smiled; the house prayed and wept.\n\nIf one succeeded in passing the porter, which was not easy,--which was\neven nearly impossible for every one, for there was an open sesame!\nwhich it was necessary to know,--if, the porter once passed, one entered\na little vestibule on the right, on which opened a staircase shut in\nbetween two walls and so narrow that only one person could ascend it at\na time, if one did not allow one's self to be alarmed by a daubing of\ncanary yellow, with a dado of chocolate which clothed this staircase, if\none ventured to ascend it, one crossed a first landing, then a second,\nand arrived on the first story at a corridor where the yellow wash and\nthe chocolate-hued plinth pursued one with a peaceable persistency.\nStaircase and corridor were lighted by two beautiful windows. The\ncorridor took a turn and became dark. If one doubled this cape, one\narrived a few paces further on, in front of a door which was all the\nmore mysterious because it was not fastened. If one opened it, one\nfound one's self in a little chamber about six feet square, tiled,\nwell-scrubbed, clean, cold, and hung with nankin paper with green\nflowers, at fifteen sous the roll. A white, dull light fell from a large\nwindow, with tiny panes, on the left, which usurped the whole width\nof the room. One gazed about, but saw no one; one listened, one heard\nneither a footstep nor a human murmur. The walls were bare, the chamber\nwas not furnished; there was not even a chair.\n\nOne looked again, and beheld on the wall facing the door a quadrangular\nhole, about a foot square, with a grating of interlacing iron bars,\nblack, knotted, solid, which formed squares--I had almost said\nmeshes--of less than an inch and a half in diagonal length. The little\ngreen flowers of the nankin paper ran in a calm and orderly manner to\nthose iron bars, without being startled or thrown into confusion by\ntheir funereal contact. Supposing that a living being had been so\nwonderfully thin as to essay an entrance or an exit through the square\nhole, this grating would have prevented it. It did not allow the passage\nof the body, but it did allow the passage of the eyes; that is to\nsay, of the mind. This seems to have occurred to them, for it had been\nre-enforced by a sheet of tin inserted in the wall a little in the rear,\nand pierced with a thousand holes more microscopic than the holes of\na strainer. At the bottom of this plate, an aperture had been pierced\nexactly similar to the orifice of a letter box. A bit of tape attached\nto a bell-wire hung at the right of the grated opening.\n\nIf the tape was pulled, a bell rang, and one heard a voice very near at\nhand, which made one start.\n\n\"Who is there?\" the voice demanded.\n\nIt was a woman's voice, a gentle voice, so gentle that it was mournful.\n\nHere, again, there was a magical word which it was necessary to know. If\none did not know it, the voice ceased, the wall became silent once more,\nas though the terrified obscurity of the sepulchre had been on the other\nside of it.\n\nIf one knew the password, the voice resumed, \"Enter on the right.\"\n\nOne then perceived on the right, facing the window, a glass door\nsurmounted by a frame glazed and painted gray. On raising the latch and\ncrossing the threshold, one experienced precisely the same impression\nas when one enters at the theatre into a grated baignoire, before the\ngrating is lowered and the chandelier is lighted. One was, in fact, in\na sort of theatre-box, narrow, furnished with two old chairs, and a\nmuch-frayed straw matting, sparely illuminated by the vague light from\nthe glass door; a regular box, with its front just of a height to lean\nupon, bearing a tablet of black wood. This box was grated, only\nthe grating of it was not of gilded wood, as at the opera; it was a\nmonstrous lattice of iron bars, hideously interlaced and riveted to the\nwall by enormous fastenings which resembled clenched fists.\n\nThe first minutes passed; when one's eyes began to grow used to this\ncellar-like half-twilight, one tried to pass the grating, but got no\nfurther than six inches beyond it. There he encountered a barrier of\nblack shutters, re-enforced and fortified with transverse beams of wood\npainted a gingerbread yellow. These shutters were divided into long,\nnarrow slats, and they masked the entire length of the grating. They\nwere always closed. At the expiration of a few moments one heard a voice\nproceeding from behind these shutters, and saying:--\n\n\"I am here. What do you wish with me?\"\n\nIt was a beloved, sometimes an adored, voice. No one was visible. Hardly\nthe sound of a breath was audible. It seemed as though it were a spirit\nwhich had been evoked, that was speaking to you across the walls of the\ntomb.\n\nIf one chanced to be within certain prescribed and very rare conditions,\nthe slat of one of the shutters opened opposite you; the evoked spirit\nbecame an apparition. Behind the grating, behind the shutter, one\nperceived so far as the grating permitted sight, a head, of which only\nthe mouth and the chin were visible; the rest was covered with a black\nveil. One caught a glimpse of a black guimpe, and a form that was barely\ndefined, covered with a black shroud. That head spoke with you, but did\nnot look at you and never smiled at you.\n\nThe light which came from behind you was adjusted in such a manner that\nyou saw her in the white, and she saw you in the black. This light was\nsymbolical.\n\nNevertheless, your eyes plunged eagerly through that opening which\nwas made in that place shut off from all glances. A profound vagueness\nenveloped that form clad in mourning. Your eyes searched that vagueness,\nand sought to make out the surroundings of the apparition. At the\nexpiration of a very short time you discovered that you could see\nnothing. What you beheld was night, emptiness, shadows, a wintry mist\nmingled with a vapor from the tomb, a sort of terrible peace, a silence\nfrom which you could gather nothing, not even sighs, a gloom in which\nyou could distinguish nothing, not even phantoms.\n\nWhat you beheld was the interior of a cloister.\n\nIt was the interior of that severe and gloomy edifice which was called\nthe Convent of the Bernardines of the Perpetual Adoration. The box in\nwhich you stood was the parlor. The first voice which had addressed you\nwas that of the portress who always sat motionless and silent, on the\nother side of the wall, near the square opening, screened by the iron\ngrating and the plate with its thousand holes, as by a double visor.\nThe obscurity which bathed the grated box arose from the fact that the\nparlor, which had a window on the side of the world, had none on the\nside of the convent. Profane eyes must see nothing of that sacred place.\n\nNevertheless, there was something beyond that shadow; there was a light;\nthere was life in the midst of that death. Although this was the most\nstrictly walled of all convents, we shall endeavor to make our way into\nit, and to take the reader in, and to say, without transgressing the\nproper bounds, things which story-tellers have never seen, and have,\ntherefore, never described.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II--THE OBEDIENCE OF MARTIN VERGA\n\nThis convent, which in 1824 had already existed for many a long year in\nthe Rue Petit-Picpus, was a community of Bernardines of the obedience of\nMartin Verga.\n\nThese Bernardines were attached, in consequence, not to Clairvaux, like\nthe Bernardine monks, but to Citeaux, like the Benedictine monks. In\nother words, they were the subjects, not of Saint Bernard, but of Saint\nBenoit.\n\nAny one who has turned over old folios to any extent knows that Martin\nVerga founded in 1425 a congregation of Bernardines-Benedictines,\nwith Salamanca for the head of the order, and Alcala as the branch\nestablishment.\n\nThis congregation had sent out branches throughout all the Catholic\ncountries of Europe.\n\nThere is nothing unusual in the Latin Church in these grafts of one\norder on another. To mention only a single order of Saint-Benoit, which\nis here in question: there are attached to this order, without counting\nthe obedience of Martin Verga, four congregations,--two in Italy,\nMont-Cassin and Sainte-Justine of Padua; two in France, Cluny and\nSaint-Maur; and nine orders,--Vallombrosa, Granmont, the Celestins,\nthe Camaldules, the Carthusians, the Humilies, the Olivateurs, the\nSilvestrins, and lastly, Citeaux; for Citeaux itself, a trunk for other\norders, is only an offshoot of Saint-Benoit. Citeaux dates from Saint\nRobert, Abbe de Molesme, in the diocese of Langres, in 1098. Now it was\nin 529 that the devil, having retired to the desert of Subiaco--he\nwas old--had he turned hermit?--was chased from the ancient temple of\nApollo, where he dwelt, by Saint-Benoit, then aged seventeen.\n\nAfter the rule of the Carmelites, who go barefoot, wear a bit of willow\non their throats, and never sit down, the harshest rule is that of the\nBernardines-Benedictines of Martin Verga. They are clothed in black,\nwith a guimpe, which, in accordance with the express command of\nSaint-Benoit, mounts to the chin. A robe of serge with large sleeves,\na large woollen veil, the guimpe which mounts to the chin cut square on\nthe breast, the band which descends over their brow to their eyes,--this\nis their dress. All is black except the band, which is white. The\nnovices wear the same habit, but all in white. The professed nuns also\nwear a rosary at their side.\n\nThe Bernardines-Benedictines of Martin Verga practise the Perpetual\nAdoration, like the Benedictines called Ladies of the Holy Sacrament,\nwho, at the beginning of this century, had two houses in Paris,--one at\nthe Temple, the other in the Rue Neuve-Sainte-Genevieve. However, the\nBernardines-Benedictines of the Petit-Picpus, of whom we are speaking,\nwere a totally different order from the Ladies of the Holy Sacrament,\ncloistered in the Rue Neuve-Sainte-Genevieve and at the Temple. There\nwere numerous differences in their rule; there were some in their\ncostume. The Bernardines-Benedictines of the Petit-Picpus wore the\nblack guimpe, and the Benedictines of the Holy Sacrament and of the\nRue Neuve-Sainte-Genevieve wore a white one, and had, besides, on their\nbreasts, a Holy Sacrament about three inches long, in silver gilt or\ngilded copper. The nuns of the Petit-Picpus did not wear this Holy\nSacrament. The Perpetual Adoration, which was common to the house of\nthe Petit-Picpus and to the house of the Temple, leaves those two orders\nperfectly distinct. Their only resemblance lies in this practice of the\nLadies of the Holy Sacrament and the Bernardines of Martin Verga, just\nas there existed a similarity in the study and the glorification of\nall the mysteries relating to the infancy, the life, and death of Jesus\nChrist and the Virgin, between the two orders, which were, nevertheless,\nwidely separated, and on occasion even hostile. The Oratory of Italy,\nestablished at Florence by Philip de Neri, and the Oratory of France,\nestablished by Pierre de Berulle. The Oratory of France claimed the\nprecedence, since Philip de Neri was only a saint, while Berulle was a\ncardinal.\n\nLet us return to the harsh Spanish rule of Martin Verga.\n\nThe Bernardines-Benedictines of this obedience fast all the year\nround, abstain from meat, fast in Lent and on many other days which are\npeculiar to them, rise from their first sleep, from one to three o'clock\nin the morning, to read their breviary and chant matins, sleep in all\nseasons between serge sheets and on straw, make no use of the bath,\nnever light a fire, scourge themselves every Friday, observe the rule of\nsilence, speak to each other only during the recreation hours, which are\nvery brief, and wear drugget chemises for six months in the year, from\nSeptember 14th, which is the Exaltation of the Holy Cross, until Easter.\nThese six months are a modification: the rule says all the year, but\nthis drugget chemise, intolerable in the heat of summer, produced fevers\nand nervous spasms. The use of it had to be restricted. Even with this\npalliation, when the nuns put on this chemise on the 14th of September,\nthey suffer from fever for three or four days. Obedience, poverty,\nchastity, perseverance in their seclusion,--these are their vows, which\nthe rule greatly aggravates.\n\nThe prioress is elected for three years by the mothers, who are called\nmeres vocales because they have a voice in the chapter. A prioress can\nonly be re-elected twice, which fixes the longest possible reign of a\nprioress at nine years.\n\nThey never see the officiating priest, who is always hidden from them\nby a serge curtain nine feet in height. During the sermon, when the\npreacher is in the chapel, they drop their veils over their faces. They\nmust always speak low, walk with their eyes on the ground and their\nheads bowed. One man only is allowed to enter the convent,--the\narchbishop of the diocese.\n\nThere is really one other,--the gardener. But he is always an old man,\nand, in order that he may always be alone in the garden, and that the\nnuns may be warned to avoid him, a bell is attached to his knee.\n\nTheir submission to the prioress is absolute and passive. It is the\ncanonical subjection in the full force of its abnegation. As at the\nvoice of Christ, ut voci Christi, at a gesture, at the first sign,\nad nutum, ad primum signum, immediately, with cheerfulness, with\nperseverance, with a certain blind obedience, prompte, hilariter,\nperseveranter et caeca quadam obedientia, as the file in the hand of the\nworkman, quasi limam in manibus fabri, without power to read or to write\nwithout express permission, legere vel scribere non addiscerit sine\nexpressa superioris licentia.\n\nEach one of them in turn makes what they call reparation. The reparation\nis the prayer for all the sins, for all the faults, for all the\ndissensions, for all the violations, for all the iniquities, for all the\ncrimes committed on earth. For the space of twelve consecutive hours,\nfrom four o'clock in the afternoon till four o'clock in the morning, or\nfrom four o'clock in the morning until four o'clock in the afternoon,\nthe sister who is making reparation remains on her knees on the stone\nbefore the Holy Sacrament, with hands clasped, a rope around her neck.\nWhen her fatigue becomes unendurable, she prostrates herself flat on\nher face against the earth, with her arms outstretched in the form of a\ncross; this is her only relief. In this attitude she prays for all the\nguilty in the universe. This is great to sublimity.\n\nAs this act is performed in front of a post on which burns a candle, it\nis called without distinction, to make reparation or to be at the post.\nThe nuns even prefer, out of humility, this last expression, which\ncontains an idea of torture and abasement.\n\nTo make reparation is a function in which the whole soul is absorbed.\nThe sister at the post would not turn round were a thunderbolt to fall\ndirectly behind her.\n\nBesides this, there is always a sister kneeling before the Holy\nSacrament. This station lasts an hour. They relieve each other like\nsoldiers on guard. This is the Perpetual Adoration.\n\nThe prioresses and the mothers almost always bear names stamped with\npeculiar solemnity, recalling, not the saints and martyrs, but moments\nin the life of Jesus Christ: as Mother Nativity, Mother Conception,\nMother Presentation, Mother Passion. But the names of saints are not\ninterdicted.\n\nWhen one sees them, one never sees anything but their mouths.\n\nAll their teeth are yellow. No tooth-brush ever entered that convent.\nBrushing one's teeth is at the top of a ladder at whose bottom is the\nloss of one's soul.\n\nThey never say my. They possess nothing of their own, and they must not\nattach themselves to anything. They call everything our; thus: our veil,\nour chaplet; if they were speaking of their chemise, they would say our\nchemise. Sometimes they grow attached to some petty object,--to a book\nof hours, a relic, a medal that has been blessed. As soon as they become\naware that they are growing attached to this object, they must give it\nup. They recall the words of Saint Therese, to whom a great lady said,\nas she was on the point of entering her order, \"Permit me, mother, to\nsend for a Bible to which I am greatly attached.\" \"Ah, you are attached\nto something! In that case, do not enter our order!\"\n\nEvery person whatever is forbidden to shut herself up, to have a place\nof her own, a chamber. They live with their cells open. When they meet,\none says, \"Blessed and adored be the most Holy Sacrament of the altar!\"\nThe other responds, \"Forever.\" The same ceremony when one taps at the\nother's door. Hardly has she touched the door when a soft voice on the\nother side is heard to say hastily, \"Forever!\" Like all practices, this\nbecomes mechanical by force of habit; and one sometimes says forever\nbefore the other has had time to say the rather long sentence, \"Praised\nand adored be the most Holy Sacrament of the altar.\"\n\nAmong the Visitandines the one who enters says: \"Ave Maria,\" and the one\nwhose cell is entered says, \"Gratia plena.\" It is their way of saying\ngood day, which is in fact full of grace.\n\nAt each hour of the day three supplementary strokes sound from the\nchurch bell of the convent. At this signal prioress, vocal mothers,\nprofessed nuns, lay-sisters, novices, postulants, interrupt what they\nare saying, what they are doing, or what they are thinking, and all say\nin unison if it is five o'clock, for instance, \"At five o'clock and at\nall hours praised and adored be the most Holy Sacrament of the altar!\"\nIf it is eight o'clock, \"At eight o'clock and at all hours!\" and so on,\naccording to the hour.\n\nThis custom, the object of which is to break the thread of thought\nand to lead it back constantly to God, exists in many communities; the\nformula alone varies. Thus at The Infant Jesus they say, \"At this\nhour and at every hour may the love of Jesus kindle my heart!\" The\nBernardines-Benedictines of Martin Verga, cloistered fifty years ago at\nPetit-Picpus, chant the offices to a solemn psalmody, a pure Gregorian\nchant, and always with full voice during the whole course of the office.\nEverywhere in the missal where an asterisk occurs they pause, and say in\na low voice, \"Jesus-Marie-Joseph.\" For the office of the dead they adopt\na tone so low that the voices of women can hardly descend to such a\ndepth. The effect produced is striking and tragic.\n\nThe nuns of the Petit-Picpus had made a vault under their grand altar\nfor the burial of their community. The Government, as they say, does not\npermit this vault to receive coffins so they leave the convent when they\ndie. This is an affliction to them, and causes them consternation as an\ninfraction of the rules.\n\nThey had obtained a mediocre consolation at best,--permission to be\ninterred at a special hour and in a special corner in the ancient\nVaugirard cemetery, which was made of land which had formerly belonged\nto their community.\n\nOn Fridays the nuns hear high mass, vespers, and all the offices, as on\nSunday. They scrupulously observe in addition all the little festivals\nunknown to people of the world, of which the Church of France was so\nprodigal in the olden days, and of which it is still prodigal in Spain\nand Italy. Their stations in the chapel are interminable. As for the\nnumber and duration of their prayers we can convey no better idea of\nthem than by quoting the ingenuous remark of one of them: \"The prayers\nof the postulants are frightful, the prayers of the novices are still\nworse, and the prayers of the professed nuns are still worse.\"\n\nOnce a week the chapter assembles: the prioress presides; the vocal\nmothers assist. Each sister kneels in turn on the stones, and confesses\naloud, in the presence of all, the faults and sins which she has\ncommitted during the week. The vocal mothers consult after each\nconfession and inflict the penance aloud.\n\nBesides this confession in a loud tone, for which all faults in the\nleast serious are reserved, they have for their venial offences what\nthey call the coulpe. To make one's coulpe means to prostrate one's self\nflat on one's face during the office in front of the prioress until\nthe latter, who is never called anything but our mother, notifies the\nculprit by a slight tap of her foot against the wood of her stall that\nshe can rise. The coulpe or peccavi, is made for a very small matter--a\nbroken glass, a torn veil, an involuntary delay of a few seconds at an\noffice, a false note in church, etc.; this suffices, and the coulpe\nis made. The coulpe is entirely spontaneous; it is the culpable person\nherself (the word is etymologically in its place here) who judges\nherself and inflicts it on herself. On festival days and Sundays four\nmother precentors intone the offices before a large reading-desk with\nfour places. One day one of the mother precentors intoned a psalm\nbeginning with Ecce, and instead of Ecce she uttered aloud the three\nnotes do si sol; for this piece of absent-mindedness she underwent a\ncoulpe which lasted during the whole service: what rendered the fault\nenormous was the fact that the chapter had laughed.\n\nWhen a nun is summoned to the parlor, even were it the prioress herself,\nshe drops her veil, as will be remembered, so that only her mouth is\nvisible.\n\nThe prioress alone can hold communication with strangers. The others can\nsee only their immediate family, and that very rarely. If, by chance,\nan outsider presents herself to see a nun, or one whom she has known and\nloved in the outer world, a regular series of negotiations is required.\nIf it is a woman, the authorization may sometimes be granted; the nun\ncomes, and they talk to her through the shutters, which are opened only\nfor a mother or sister. It is unnecessary to say that permission is\nalways refused to men.\n\nSuch is the rule of Saint-Benoit, aggravated by Martin Verga.\n\nThese nuns are not gay, rosy, and fresh, as the daughters of other\norders often are. They are pale and grave. Between 1825 and 1830 three\nof them went mad.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III--AUSTERITIES\n\nOne is a postulant for two years at least, often for four; a novice for\nfour. It is rare that the definitive vows can be pronounced\nearlier than the age of twenty-three or twenty-four years. The\nBernardines-Benedictines of Martin Verga do not admit widows to their\norder.\n\nIn their cells, they deliver themselves up to many unknown macerations,\nof which they must never speak.\n\nOn the day when a novice makes her profession, she is dressed in her\nhandsomest attire, she is crowned with white roses, her hair is brushed\nuntil it shines, and curled. Then she prostrates herself; a great black\nveil is thrown over her, and the office for the dead is sung. Then the\nnuns separate into two files; one file passes close to her, saying in\nplaintive accents, \"Our sister is dead\"; and the other file responds in\na voice of ecstasy, \"Our sister is alive in Jesus Christ!\"\n\nAt the epoch when this story takes place, a boarding-school was attached\nto the convent--a boarding-school for young girls of noble and\nmostly wealthy families, among whom could be remarked Mademoiselle\nde Saint-Aulaire and de Belissen, and an English girl bearing the\nillustrious Catholic name of Talbot. These young girls, reared by these\nnuns between four walls, grew up with a horror of the world and of the\nage. One of them said to us one day, \"The sight of the street pavement\nmade me shudder from head to foot.\" They were dressed in blue, with a\nwhite cap and a Holy Spirit of silver gilt or of copper on their breast.\nOn certain grand festival days, particularly Saint Martha's day, they\nwere permitted, as a high favor and a supreme happiness, to dress\nthemselves as nuns and to carry out the offices and practice of\nSaint-Benoit for a whole day. In the early days the nuns were in the\nhabit of lending them their black garments. This seemed profane, and\nthe prioress forbade it. Only the novices were permitted to lend. It is\nremarkable that these performances, tolerated and encouraged, no doubt,\nin the convent out of a secret spirit of proselytism and in order\nto give these children a foretaste of the holy habit, were a genuine\nhappiness and a real recreation for the scholars. They simply amused\nthemselves with it. It was new; it gave them a change. Candid reasons\nof childhood, which do not, however, succeed in making us worldlings\ncomprehend the felicity of holding a holy water sprinkler in one's hand\nand standing for hours together singing hard enough for four in front of\na reading-desk.\n\nThe pupils conformed, with the exception of the austerities, to all the\npractices of the convent. There was a certain young woman who entered\nthe world, and who after many years of married life had not succeeded in\nbreaking herself of the habit of saying in great haste whenever any\none knocked at her door, \"forever!\" Like the nuns, the pupils saw\ntheir relatives only in the parlor. Their very mothers did not obtain\npermission to embrace them. The following illustrates to what a degree\nseverity on that point was carried. One day a young girl received a\nvisit from her mother, who was accompanied by a little sister three\nyears of age. The young girl wept, for she wished greatly to embrace\nher sister. Impossible. She begged that, at least, the child might be\npermitted to pass her little hand through the bars so that she could\nkiss it. This was almost indignantly refused.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV--GAYETIES\n\nNone the less, these young girls filled this grave house with charming\nsouvenirs.\n\nAt certain hours childhood sparkled in that cloister. The recreation\nhour struck. A door swung on its hinges. The birds said, \"Good;\nhere come the children!\" An irruption of youth inundated that garden\nintersected with a cross like a shroud. Radiant faces, white foreheads,\ninnocent eyes, full of merry light, all sorts of auroras, were scattered\nabout amid these shadows. After the psalmodies, the bells, the peals,\nand knells and offices, the sound of these little girls burst forth on a\nsudden more sweetly than the noise of bees. The hive of joy was opened,\nand each one brought her honey. They played, they called to each other,\nthey formed into groups, they ran about; pretty little white teeth\nchattered in the corners; the veils superintended the laughs from a\ndistance, shades kept watch of the sunbeams, but what mattered it? Still\nthey beamed and laughed. Those four lugubrious walls had their moment\nof dazzling brilliancy. They looked on, vaguely blanched with the\nreflection of so much joy at this sweet swarming of the hives. It was\nlike a shower of roses falling athwart this house of mourning. The young\ngirls frolicked beneath the eyes of the nuns; the gaze of impeccability\ndoes not embarrass innocence. Thanks to these children, there was,\namong so many austere hours, one hour of ingenuousness. The little ones\nskipped about; the elder ones danced. In this cloister play was mingled\nwith heaven. Nothing is so delightful and so august as all these fresh,\nexpanding young souls. Homer would have come thither to laugh with\nPerrault; and there was in that black garden, youth, health, noise,\ncries, giddiness, pleasure, happiness enough to smooth out the wrinkles\nof all their ancestresses, those of the epic as well as those of the\nfairy-tale, those of the throne as well as those of the thatched cottage\nfrom Hecuba to la Mere-Grand.\n\nIn that house more than anywhere else, perhaps, arise those children's\nsayings which are so graceful and which evoke a smile that is full of\nthoughtfulness. It was between those four gloomy walls that a child of\nfive years exclaimed one day: \"Mother! one of the big girls has just\ntold me that I have only nine years and ten months longer to remain\nhere. What happiness!\"\n\nIt was here, too, that this memorable dialogue took place:--\n\nA Vocal Mother. Why are you weeping, my child?\n\nThe child (aged six). I told Alix that I knew my French history. She\nsays that I do not know it, but I do.\n\nAlix, the big girl (aged nine). No; she does not know it.\n\nThe Mother. How is that, my child?\n\nAlix. She told me to open the book at random and to ask her any question\nin the book, and she would answer it.\n\n\"Well?\"\n\n\"She did not answer it.\"\n\n\"Let us see about it. What did you ask her?\"\n\n\"I opened the book at random, as she proposed, and I put the first\nquestion that I came across.\"\n\n\"And what was the question?\"\n\n\"It was, 'What happened after that?'\"\n\nIt was there that that profound remark was made anent a rather greedy\nparoquet which belonged to a lady boarder:--\n\n\"How well bred! it eats the top of the slice of bread and butter just\nlike a person!\"\n\nIt was on one of the flagstones of this cloister that there was once\npicked up a confession which had been written out in advance, in order\nthat she might not forget it, by a sinner of seven years:--\n\n\"Father, I accuse myself of having been avaricious.\n\n\"Father, I accuse myself of having been an adulteress.\n\n\"Father, I accuse myself of having raised my eyes to the gentlemen.\"\n\nIt was on one of the turf benches of this garden that a rosy mouth six\nyears of age improvised the following tale, which was listened to by\nblue eyes aged four and five years:--\n\n\"There were three little cocks who owned a country where there were\na great many flowers. They plucked the flowers and put them in their\npockets. After that they plucked the leaves and put them in their\nplaythings. There was a wolf in that country; there was a great deal of\nforest; and the wolf was in the forest; and he ate the little cocks.\"\n\nAnd this other poem:--\n\n\"There came a blow with a stick.\n\n\"It was Punchinello who bestowed it on the cat.\n\n\"It was not good for her; it hurt her.\n\n\"Then a lady put Punchinello in prison.\"\n\nIt was there that a little abandoned child, a foundling whom the convent\nwas bringing up out of charity, uttered this sweet and heart-breaking\nsaying. She heard the others talking of their mothers, and she murmured\nin her corner:--\n\n\"As for me, my mother was not there when I was born!\"\n\nThere was a stout portress who could always be seen hurrying through the\ncorridors with her bunch of keys, and whose name was Sister Agatha. The\nbig big girls--those over ten years of age--called her Agathocles.\n\nThe refectory, a large apartment of an oblong square form, which\nreceived no light except through a vaulted cloister on a level with the\ngarden, was dark and damp, and, as the children say, full of beasts. All\nthe places round about furnished their contingent of insects.\n\nEach of its four corners had received, in the language of the pupils,\na special and expressive name. There was Spider corner, Caterpillar\ncorner, Wood-louse corner, and Cricket corner.\n\nCricket corner was near the kitchen and was highly esteemed. It was not\nso cold there as elsewhere. From the refectory the names had passed to\nthe boarding-school, and there served as in the old College Mazarin\nto distinguish four nations. Every pupil belonged to one of these four\nnations according to the corner of the refectory in which she sat at\nmeals. One day Monseigneur the Archbishop while making his pastoral\nvisit saw a pretty little rosy girl with beautiful golden hair enter the\nclass-room through which he was passing.\n\nHe inquired of another pupil, a charming brunette with rosy cheeks, who\nstood near him:--\n\n\"Who is that?\"\n\n\"She is a spider, Monseigneur.\"\n\n\"Bah! And that one yonder?\"\n\n\"She is a cricket.\"\n\n\"And that one?\"\n\n\"She is a caterpillar.\"\n\n\"Really! and yourself?\"\n\n\"I am a wood-louse, Monseigneur.\"\n\nEvery house of this sort has its own peculiarities. At the beginning of\nthis century Ecouen was one of those strict and graceful places where\nyoung girls pass their childhood in a shadow that is almost august. At\nEcouen, in order to take rank in the procession of the Holy Sacrament,\na distinction was made between virgins and florists. There were also the\n\"dais\" and the \"censors,\"--the first who held the cords of the dais, and\nthe others who carried incense before the Holy Sacrament. The flowers\nbelonged by right to the florists. Four \"virgins\" walked in advance. On\nthe morning of that great day it was no rare thing to hear the question\nput in the dormitory, \"Who is a virgin?\"\n\nMadame Campan used to quote this saying of a \"little one\" of seven\nyears, to a \"big girl\" of sixteen, who took the head of the procession,\nwhile she, the little one, remained at the rear, \"You are a virgin, but\nI am not.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V--DISTRACTIONS\n\nAbove the door of the refectory this prayer, which was called the white\nPaternoster, and which possessed the property of bearing people straight\nto paradise, was inscribed in large black letters:--\n\n\"Little white Paternoster, which God made, which God said, which God\nplaced in paradise. In the evening, when I went to bed, I found three\nangels sitting on my bed, one at the foot, two at the head, the good\nVirgin Mary in the middle, who told me to lie down without hesitation.\nThe good God is my father, the good Virgin is my mother, the three\napostles are my brothers, the three virgins are my sisters. The shirt in\nwhich God was born envelopes my body; Saint Margaret's cross is written\non my breast. Madame the Virgin was walking through the meadows, weeping\nfor God, when she met M. Saint John. 'Monsieur Saint John, whence come\nyou?' 'I come from Ave Salus.' 'You have not seen the good God; where\nis he?' 'He is on the tree of the Cross, his feet hanging, his hands\nnailed, a little cap of white thorns on his head.' Whoever shall say\nthis thrice at eventide, thrice in the morning, shall win paradise at\nthe last.\"\n\nIn 1827 this characteristic orison had disappeared from the wall under\na triple coating of daubing paint. At the present time it is finally\ndisappearing from the memories of several who were young girls then, and\nwho are old women now.\n\nA large crucifix fastened to the wall completed the decoration of this\nrefectory, whose only door, as we think we have mentioned, opened on the\ngarden. Two narrow tables, each flanked by two wooden benches, formed\ntwo long parallel lines from one end to the other of the refectory.\nThe walls were white, the tables were black; these two mourning colors\nconstitute the only variety in convents. The meals were plain, and\nthe food of the children themselves severe. A single dish of meat and\nvegetables combined, or salt fish--such was their luxury. This meagre\nfare, which was reserved for the pupils alone, was, nevertheless, an\nexception. The children ate in silence, under the eye of the mother\nwhose turn it was, who, if a fly took a notion to fly or to hum against\nthe rule, opened and shut a wooden book from time to time. This silence\nwas seasoned with the lives of the saints, read aloud from a little\npulpit with a desk, which was situated at the foot of the crucifix. The\nreader was one of the big girls, in weekly turn. At regular distances,\non the bare tables, there were large, varnished bowls in which the\npupils washed their own silver cups and knives and forks, and into which\nthey sometimes threw some scrap of tough meat or spoiled fish; this was\npunished. These bowls were called ronds d'eau. The child who broke the\nsilence \"made a cross with her tongue.\" Where? On the ground. She licked\nthe pavement. The dust, that end of all joys, was charged with the\nchastisement of those poor little rose-leaves which had been guilty of\nchirping.\n\nThere was in the convent a book which has never been printed except as\na unique copy, and which it is forbidden to read. It is the rule of\nSaint-Benoit. An arcanum which no profane eye must penetrate. Nemo\nregulas, seu constitutiones nostras, externis communicabit.\n\nThe pupils one day succeeded in getting possession of this book, and set\nto reading it with avidity, a reading which was often interrupted by\nthe fear of being caught, which caused them to close the volume\nprecipitately.\n\nFrom the great danger thus incurred they derived but a very moderate\namount of pleasure. The most \"interesting thing\" they found were some\nunintelligible pages about the sins of young boys.\n\nThey played in an alley of the garden bordered with a few shabby\nfruit-trees. In spite of the extreme surveillance and the severity of\nthe punishments administered, when the wind had shaken the trees, they\nsometimes succeeded in picking up a green apple or a spoiled apricot or\nan inhabited pear on the sly. I will now cede the privilege of speech\nto a letter which lies before me, a letter written five and twenty\nyears ago by an old pupil, now Madame la Duchesse de----one of the most\nelegant women in Paris. I quote literally: \"One hides one's pear or\none's apple as best one may. When one goes up stairs to put the veil on\nthe bed before supper, one stuffs them under one's pillow and at night\none eats them in bed, and when one cannot do that, one eats them in the\ncloset.\" That was one of their greatest luxuries.\n\nOnce--it was at the epoch of the visit from the archbishop to the\nconvent--one of the young girls, Mademoiselle Bouchard, who was\nconnected with the Montmorency family, laid a wager that she would ask\nfor a day's leave of absence--an enormity in so austere a community. The\nwager was accepted, but not one of those who bet believed that she would\ndo it. When the moment came, as the archbishop was passing in front of\nthe pupils, Mademoiselle Bouchard, to the indescribable terror of her\ncompanions, stepped out of the ranks, and said, \"Monseigneur, a day's\nleave of absence.\" Mademoiselle Bouchard was tall, blooming, with the\nprettiest little rosy face in the world. M. de Quelen smiled and said,\n\"What, my dear child, a day's leave of absence! Three days if you like.\nI grant you three days.\" The prioress could do nothing; the archbishop\nhad spoken. Horror of the convent, but joy of the pupil. The effect may\nbe imagined.\n\nThis stern cloister was not so well walled off, however, but that the\nlife of the passions of the outside world, drama, and even romance,\ndid not make their way in. To prove this, we will confine ourselves to\nrecording here and to briefly mentioning a real and incontestable fact,\nwhich, however, bears no reference in itself to, and is not connected by\nany thread whatever with the story which we are relating. We mention the\nfact for the sake of completing the physiognomy of the convent in the\nreader's mind.\n\nAbout this time there was in the convent a mysterious person who was\nnot a nun, who was treated with great respect, and who was addressed as\nMadame Albertine. Nothing was known about her, save that she was mad,\nand that in the world she passed for dead. Beneath this history it\nwas said there lay the arrangements of fortune necessary for a great\nmarriage.\n\nThis woman, hardly thirty years of age, of dark complexion and tolerably\npretty, had a vague look in her large black eyes. Could she see? There\nwas some doubt about this. She glided rather than walked, she never\nspoke; it was not quite known whether she breathed. Her nostrils were\nlivid and pinched as after yielding up their last sigh. To touch her\nhand was like touching snow. She possessed a strange spectral grace.\nWherever she entered, people felt cold. One day a sister, on seeing her\npass, said to another sister, \"She passes for a dead woman.\" \"Perhaps\nshe is one,\" replied the other.\n\nA hundred tales were told of Madame Albertine. This arose from the\neternal curiosity of the pupils. In the chapel there was a gallery\ncalled L'OEil de Boeuf. It was in this gallery, which had only a\ncircular bay, an oeil de boeuf, that Madame Albertine listened to the\noffices. She always occupied it alone because from this gallery, being\non the level of the first story, the preacher or the officiating priest\ncould be seen, which was interdicted to the nuns. One day the pulpit was\noccupied by a young priest of high rank, M. Le Duc de Rohan, peer of\nFrance, officer of the Red Musketeers in 1815 when he was Prince de\nLeon, and who died afterward, in 1830, as cardinal and Archbishop of\nBesancon. It was the first time that M. de Rohan had preached at the\nPetit-Picpus convent. Madame Albertine usually preserved perfect\ncalmness and complete immobility during the sermons and services. That\nday, as soon as she caught sight of M. de Rohan, she half rose, and\nsaid, in a loud voice, amid the silence of the chapel, \"Ah! Auguste!\"\nThe whole community turned their heads in amazement, the preacher raised\nhis eyes, but Madame Albertine had relapsed into her immobility. A\nbreath from the outer world, a flash of life, had passed for an instant\nacross that cold and lifeless face and had then vanished, and the mad\nwoman had become a corpse again.\n\nThose two words, however, had set every one in the convent who had the\nprivilege of speech to chattering. How many things were contained in\nthat \"Ah! Auguste!\" what revelations! M. de Rohan's name really was\nAuguste. It was evident that Madame Albertine belonged to the very\nhighest society, since she knew M. de Rohan, and that her own rank there\nwas of the highest, since she spoke thus familiarly of so great a lord,\nand that there existed between them some connection, of relationship,\nperhaps, but a very close one in any case, since she knew his \"pet\nname.\"\n\nTwo very severe duchesses, Mesdames de Choiseul and de Serent, often\nvisited the community, whither they penetrated, no doubt, in virtue of\nthe privilege Magnates mulieres, and caused great consternation in the\nboarding-school. When these two old ladies passed by, all the poor young\ngirls trembled and dropped their eyes.\n\nMoreover, M. de Rohan, quite unknown to himself, was an object of\nattention to the school-girls. At that epoch he had just been made,\nwhile waiting for the episcopate, vicar-general of the Archbishop of\nParis. It was one of his habits to come tolerably often to celebrate the\noffices in the chapel of the nuns of the Petit-Picpus. Not one of the\nyoung recluses could see him, because of the serge curtain, but he had\na sweet and rather shrill voice, which they had come to know and to\ndistinguish. He had been a mousquetaire, and then, he was said to be\nvery coquettish, that his handsome brown hair was very well dressed in\na roll around his head, and that he had a broad girdle of magnificent\nmoire, and that his black cassock was of the most elegant cut in the\nworld. He held a great place in all these imaginations of sixteen years.\n\nNot a sound from without made its way into the convent. But there was\none year when the sound of a flute penetrated thither. This was an\nevent, and the girls who were at school there at the time still recall\nit.\n\nIt was a flute which was played in the neighborhood. This flute always\nplayed the same air, an air which is very far away nowadays,--\"My\nZetulbe, come reign o'er my soul,\"--and it was heard two or three\ntimes a day. The young girls passed hours in listening to it, the vocal\nmothers were upset by it, brains were busy, punishments descended in\nshowers. This lasted for several months. The girls were all more or\nless in love with the unknown musician. Each one dreamed that she was\nZetulbe. The sound of the flute proceeded from the direction of the Rue\nDroit-Mur; and they would have given anything, compromised everything,\nattempted anything for the sake of seeing, of catching a glance, if only\nfor a second, of the \"young man\" who played that flute so deliciously,\nand who, no doubt, played on all these souls at the same time. There\nwere some who made their escape by a back door, and ascended to the\nthird story on the Rue Droit-Mur side, in order to attempt to catch a\nglimpse through the gaps. Impossible! One even went so far as to thrust\nher arm through the grating, and to wave her white handkerchief. Two\nwere still bolder. They found means to climb on a roof, and risked their\nlives there, and succeeded at last in seeing \"the young man.\" He was an\nold emigre gentleman, blind and penniless, who was playing his flute in\nhis attic, in order to pass the time.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI--THE LITTLE CONVENT\n\nIn this enclosure of the Petit-Picpus there were three perfectly\ndistinct buildings,--the Great Convent, inhabited by the nuns, the\nBoarding-school, where the scholars were lodged; and lastly, what was\ncalled the Little Convent. It was a building with a garden, in which\nlived all sorts of aged nuns of various orders, the relics of cloisters\ndestroyed in the Revolution; a reunion of all the black, gray, and white\nmedleys of all communities and all possible varieties; what might be\ncalled, if such a coupling of words is permissible, a sort of harlequin\nconvent.\n\nWhen the Empire was established, all these poor old dispersed and exiled\nwomen had been accorded permission to come and take shelter under the\nwings of the Bernardines-Benedictines. The government paid them a small\npension, the ladies of the Petit-Picpus received them cordially. It was\na singular pell-mell. Each followed her own rule, Sometimes the pupils\nof the boarding-school were allowed, as a great recreation, to pay them\na visit; the result is, that all those young memories have\nretained among other souvenirs that of Mother Sainte-Bazile, Mother\nSainte-Scolastique, and Mother Jacob.\n\nOne of these refugees found herself almost at home. She was a nun of\nSainte-Aure, the only one of her order who had survived. The ancient\nconvent of the ladies of Sainte-Aure occupied, at the beginning of the\neighteenth century, this very house of the Petit-Picpus, which belonged\nlater to the Benedictines of Martin Verga. This holy woman, too poor to\nwear the magnificent habit of her order, which was a white robe with\na scarlet scapulary, had piously put it on a little manikin, which she\nexhibited with complacency and which she bequeathed to the house at\nher death. In 1824, only one nun of this order remained; to-day, there\nremains only a doll.\n\nIn addition to these worthy mothers, some old society women had obtained\npermission of the prioress, like Madame Albertine, to retire into the\nLittle Convent. Among the number were Madame Beaufort d'Hautpoul and\nMarquise Dufresne. Another was never known in the convent except by\nthe formidable noise which she made when she blew her nose. The pupils\ncalled her Madame Vacarmini (hubbub).\n\nAbout 1820 or 1821, Madame de Genlis, who was at that time editing a\nlittle periodical publication called l'Intrepide, asked to be allowed\nto enter the convent of the Petit-Picpus as lady resident. The Duc\nd'Orleans recommended her. Uproar in the hive; the vocal-mothers were\nall in a flutter; Madame de Genlis had made romances. But she declared\nthat she was the first to detest them, and then, she had reached her\nfierce stage of devotion. With the aid of God, and of the Prince, she\nentered. She departed at the end of six or eight months, alleging as a\nreason, that there was no shade in the garden. The nuns were delighted.\nAlthough very old, she still played the harp, and did it very well.\n\nWhen she went away she left her mark in her cell. Madame de Genlis was\nsuperstitious and a Latinist. These two words furnish a tolerably good\nprofile of her. A few years ago, there were still to be seen, pasted in\nthe inside of a little cupboard in her cell in which she locked up her\nsilverware and her jewels, these five lines in Latin, written with\nher own hand in red ink on yellow paper, and which, in her opinion,\npossessed the property of frightening away robbers:--\n\n\n               Imparibus meritis pendent tria corpora ramis:[15]\n               Dismas et Gesmas, media est divina potestas;\n               Alta petit Dismas, infelix, infima, Gesmas;\n               Nos et res nostras conservet summa potestas.\n               Hos versus dicas, ne tu furto tua perdas.\n\n\nThese verses in sixth century Latin raise the question whether the\ntwo thieves of Calvary were named, as is commonly believed, Dismas and\nGestas, or Dismas and Gesmas. This orthography might have confounded the\npretensions put forward in the last century by the Vicomte de Gestas, of\na descent from the wicked thief. However, the useful virtue attached to\nthese verses forms an article of faith in the order of the Hospitallers.\n\nThe church of the house, constructed in such a manner as to separate the\nGreat Convent from the Boarding-school like a veritable intrenchment,\nwas, of course, common to the Boarding-school, the Great Convent, and\nthe Little Convent. The public was even admitted by a sort of lazaretto\nentrance on the street. But all was so arranged, that none of the\ninhabitants of the cloister could see a face from the outside world.\nSuppose a church whose choir is grasped in a gigantic hand, and\nfolded in such a manner as to form, not, as in ordinary churches, a\nprolongation behind the altar, but a sort of hall, or obscure cellar, to\nthe right of the officiating priest; suppose this hall to be shut off by\na curtain seven feet in height, of which we have already spoken; in the\nshadow of that curtain, pile up on wooden stalls the nuns in the choir\non the left, the school-girls on the right, the lay-sisters and the\nnovices at the bottom, and you will have some idea of the nuns of the\nPetit-Picpus assisting at divine service. That cavern, which was called\nthe choir, communicated with the cloister by a lobby. The church was\nlighted from the garden. When the nuns were present at services where\ntheir rule enjoined silence, the public was warned of their presence\nonly by the folding seats of the stalls noisily rising and falling.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII--SOME SILHOUETTES OF THIS DARKNESS\n\nDuring the six years which separate 1819 from 1825, the prioress of the\nPetit-Picpus was Mademoiselle de Blemeur, whose name, in religion,\nwas Mother Innocente. She came of the family of Marguerite de Blemeur,\nauthor of Lives of the Saints of the Order of Saint-Benoit. She had\nbeen re-elected. She was a woman about sixty years of age, short, thick,\n\"singing like a cracked pot,\" says the letter which we have already\nquoted; an excellent woman, moreover, and the only merry one in the\nwhole convent, and for that reason adored. She was learned, erudite,\nwise, competent, curiously proficient in history, crammed with Latin,\nstuffed with Greek, full of Hebrew, and more of a Benedictine monk than\na Benedictine nun.\n\nThe sub-prioress was an old Spanish nun, Mother Cineres, who was almost\nblind.\n\nThe most esteemed among the vocal mothers were Mother Sainte-Honorine;\nthe treasurer, Mother Sainte-Gertrude, the chief mistress of the\nnovices; Mother-Saint-Ange, the assistant mistress; Mother Annonciation,\nthe sacristan; Mother Saint-Augustin, the nurse, the only one in the\nconvent who was malicious; then Mother Sainte-Mechtilde (Mademoiselle\nGauvain), very young and with a beautiful voice; Mother des Anges\n(Mademoiselle Drouet), who had been in the convent of the Filles-Dieu,\nand in the convent du Tresor, between Gisors and Magny; Mother\nSaint-Joseph (Mademoiselle de Cogolludo), Mother Sainte-Adelaide\n(Mademoiselle d'Auverney), Mother Misericorde (Mademoiselle de\nCifuentes, who could not resist austerities), Mother Compassion\n(Mademoiselle de la Miltiere, received at the age of sixty in defiance\nof the rule, and very wealthy); Mother Providence (Mademoiselle de\nLaudiniere), Mother Presentation (Mademoiselle de Siguenza), who was\nprioress in 1847; and finally, Mother Sainte-Celigne (sister of the\nsculptor Ceracchi), who went mad; Mother Sainte-Chantal (Mademoiselle de\nSuzon), who went mad.\n\nThere was also, among the prettiest of them, a charming girl of three\nand twenty, who was from the Isle de Bourbon, a descendant of the\nChevalier Roze, whose name had been Mademoiselle Roze, and who was\ncalled Mother Assumption.\n\nMother Sainte-Mechtilde, intrusted with the singing and the choir, was\nfond of making use of the pupils in this quarter. She usually took a\ncomplete scale of them, that is to say, seven, from ten to sixteen years\nof age, inclusive, of assorted voices and sizes, whom she made sing\nstanding, drawn up in a line, side by side, according to age, from the\nsmallest to the largest. This presented to the eye, something in the\nnature of a reed-pipe of young girls, a sort of living Pan-pipe made of\nangels.\n\nThose of the lay-sisters whom the scholars loved most were Sister\nEuphrasie, Sister Sainte-Marguerite, Sister Sainte-Marthe, who was in\nher dotage, and Sister Sainte-Michel, whose long nose made them laugh.\n\nAll these women were gentle with the children. The nuns were severe only\ntowards themselves. No fire was lighted except in the school, and the\nfood was choice compared to that in the convent. Moreover, they lavished\na thousand cares on their scholars. Only, when a child passed near a nun\nand addressed her, the nun never replied.\n\nThis rule of silence had had this effect, that throughout the whole\nconvent, speech had been withdrawn from human creatures, and bestowed\non inanimate objects. Now it was the church-bell which spoke, now it was\nthe gardener's bell. A very sonorous bell, placed beside the portress,\nand which was audible throughout the house, indicated by its varied\npeals, which formed a sort of acoustic telegraph, all the actions of\nmaterial life which were to be performed, and summoned to the parlor, in\ncase of need, such or such an inhabitant of the house. Each person\nand each thing had its own peal. The prioress had one and one, the\nsub-prioress one and two. Six-five announced lessons, so that the pupils\nnever said \"to go to lessons,\" but \"to go to six-five.\" Four-four was\nMadame de Genlis's signal. It was very often heard. \"C'est le diable\na quatre,\"--it's the very deuce--said the uncharitable. Tennine strokes\nannounced a great event. It was the opening of the door of seclusion,\na frightful sheet of iron bristling with bolts which only turned on its\nhinges in the presence of the archbishop.\n\nWith the exception of the archbishop and the gardener, no man entered\nthe convent, as we have already said. The schoolgirls saw two others:\none, the chaplain, the Abbe Banes, old and ugly, whom they were\npermitted to contemplate in the choir, through a grating; the other the\ndrawing-master, M. Ansiaux, whom the letter, of which we have perused a\nfew lines, calls M. Anciot, and describes as a frightful old hunchback.\n\nIt will be seen that all these men were carefully chosen.\n\nSuch was this curious house.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII--POST CORDA LAPIDES\n\nAfter having sketched its moral face, it will not prove unprofitable\nto point out, in a few words, its material configuration. The reader\nalready has some idea of it.\n\nThe convent of the Petit-Picpus-Sainte-Antoine filled almost the whole\nof the vast trapezium which resulted from the intersection of the Rue\nPolonceau, the Rue Droit-Mur, the Rue Petit-Picpus, and the unused lane,\ncalled Rue Aumarais on old plans. These four streets surrounded this\ntrapezium like a moat. The convent was composed of several buildings\nand a garden. The principal building, taken in its entirety, was a\njuxtaposition of hybrid constructions which, viewed from a bird's-eye\nview, outlined, with considerable exactness, a gibbet laid flat on the\nground. The main arm of the gibbet occupied the whole of the fragment\nof the Rue Droit-Mur comprised between the Rue Petit-Picpus and the Rue\nPolonceau; the lesser arm was a lofty, gray, severe grated facade which\nfaced the Rue Petit-Picpus; the carriage entrance No. 62 marked its\nextremity. Towards the centre of this facade was a low, arched door,\nwhitened with dust and ashes, where the spiders wove their webs,\nand which was open only for an hour or two on Sundays, and on rare\noccasions, when the coffin of a nun left the convent. This was the\npublic entrance of the church. The elbow of the gibbet was a square\nhall which was used as the servants' hall, and which the nuns called the\nbuttery. In the main arm were the cells of the mothers, the sisters, and\nthe novices. In the lesser arm lay the kitchens, the refectory, backed\nup by the cloisters and the church. Between the door No. 62 and the\ncorner of the closed lane Aumarais, was the school, which was not\nvisible from without. The remainder of the trapezium formed the garden,\nwhich was much lower than the level of the Rue Polonceau, which caused\nthe walls to be very much higher on the inside than on the outside. The\ngarden, which was slightly arched, had in its centre, on the summit of\na hillock, a fine pointed and conical fir-tree, whence ran, as from\nthe peaked boss of a shield, four grand alleys, and, ranged by twos\nin between the branchings of these, eight small ones, so that, if the\nenclosure had been circular, the geometrical plan of the alleys would\nhave resembled a cross superposed on a wheel. As the alleys all ended\nin the very irregular walls of the garden, they were of unequal length.\nThey were bordered with currant bushes. At the bottom, an alley of tall\npoplars ran from the ruins of the old convent, which was at the angle of\nthe Rue Droit-Mur to the house of the Little Convent, which was at the\nangle of the Aumarais lane. In front of the Little Convent was what was\ncalled the little garden. To this whole, let the reader add a courtyard,\nall sorts of varied angles formed by the interior buildings, prison\nwalls, the long black line of roofs which bordered the other side of the\nRue Polonceau for its sole perspective and neighborhood, and he will\nbe able to form for himself a complete image of what the house of the\nBernardines of the Petit-Picpus was forty years ago. This holy house\nhad been built on the precise site of a famous tennis-ground of the\nfourteenth to the sixteenth century, which was called the \"tennis-ground\nof the eleven thousand devils.\"\n\nAll these streets, moreover, were more ancient than Paris. These names,\nDroit-Mur and Aumarais, are very ancient; the streets which bear them\nare very much more ancient still. Aumarais Lane was called Maugout Lane;\nthe Rue Droit-Mur was called the Rue des Eglantiers, for God opened\nflowers before man cut stones.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX--A CENTURY UNDER A GUIMPE\n\nSince we are engaged in giving details as to what the convent of the\nPetit-Picpus was in former times, and since we have ventured to open\na window on that discreet retreat, the reader will permit us one other\nlittle digression, utterly foreign to this book, but characteristic and\nuseful, since it shows that the cloister even has its original figures.\n\nIn the Little Convent there was a centenarian who came from the Abbey\nof Fontevrault. She had even been in society before the Revolution. She\ntalked a great deal of M. de Miromesnil, Keeper of the Seals under Louis\nXVI. and of a Presidentess Duplat, with whom she had been very intimate.\nIt was her pleasure and her vanity to drag in these names on every\npretext. She told wonders of the Abbey of Fontevrault,--that it was like\na city, and that there were streets in the monastery.\n\nShe talked with a Picard accent which amused the pupils. Every year,\nshe solemnly renewed her vows, and at the moment of taking the oath, she\nsaid to the priest, \"Monseigneur Saint-Francois gave it to Monseigneur\nSaint-Julien, Monseigneur Saint-Julien gave it to Monseigneur\nSaint-Eusebius, Monseigneur Saint-Eusebius gave it to Monseigneur\nSaint-Procopius, etc., etc.; and thus I give it to you, father.\" And the\nschool-girls would begin to laugh, not in their sleeves, but under\ntheir veils; charming little stifled laughs which made the vocal mothers\nfrown.\n\nOn another occasion, the centenarian was telling stories. She said\nthat in her youth the Bernardine monks were every whit as good as the\nmousquetaires. It was a century which spoke through her, but it was the\neighteenth century. She told about the custom of the four wines, which\nexisted before the Revolution in Champagne and Bourgogne. When a great\npersonage, a marshal of France, a prince, a duke, and a peer, traversed\na town in Burgundy or Champagne, the city fathers came out to harangue\nhim and presented him with four silver gondolas into which they\nhad poured four different sorts of wine. On the first goblet this\ninscription could be read, monkey wine; on the second, lion wine; on the\nthird, sheep wine; on the fourth, hog wine. These four legends express\nthe four stages descended by the drunkard; the first, intoxication,\nwhich enlivens; the second, that which irritates; the third, that which\ndulls; and the fourth, that which brutalizes.\n\nIn a cupboard, under lock and key, she kept a mysterious object of which\nshe thought a great deal. The rule of Fontevrault did not forbid this.\nShe would not show this object to anyone. She shut herself up, which her\nrule allowed her to do, and hid herself, every time that she desired to\ncontemplate it. If she heard a footstep in the corridor, she closed the\ncupboard again as hastily as it was possible with her aged hands. As\nsoon as it was mentioned to her, she became silent, she who was so fond\nof talking. The most curious were baffled by her silence and the most\ntenacious by her obstinacy. Thus it furnished a subject of comment for\nall those who were unoccupied or bored in the convent. What could that\ntreasure of the centenarian be, which was so precious and so secret?\nSome holy book, no doubt? Some unique chaplet? Some authentic relic?\nThey lost themselves in conjectures. When the poor old woman died,\nthey rushed to her cupboard more hastily than was fitting, perhaps, and\nopened it. They found the object beneath a triple linen cloth, like some\nconsecrated paten. It was a Faenza platter representing little Loves\nflitting away pursued by apothecary lads armed with enormous syringes.\nThe chase abounds in grimaces and in comical postures. One of the\ncharming little Loves is already fairly spitted. He is resisting,\nfluttering his tiny wings, and still making an effort to fly, but the\ndancer is laughing with a satanical air. Moral: Love conquered by the\ncolic. This platter, which is very curious, and which had, possibly,\nthe honor of furnishing Moliere with an idea, was still in existence\nin September, 1845; it was for sale by a bric-a-brac merchant in the\nBoulevard Beaumarchais.\n\nThis good old woman would not receive any visits from outside because,\nsaid she, the parlor is too gloomy.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X--ORIGIN OF THE PERPETUAL ADORATION\n\nHowever, this almost sepulchral parlor, of which we have sought to\nconvey an idea, is a purely local trait which is not reproduced with the\nsame severity in other convents. At the convent of the Rue du Temple,\nin particular, which belonged, in truth, to another order, the black\nshutters were replaced by brown curtains, and the parlor itself was a\nsalon with a polished wood floor, whose windows were draped in white\nmuslin curtains and whose walls admitted all sorts of frames, a portrait\nof a Benedictine nun with unveiled face, painted bouquets, and even the\nhead of a Turk.\n\nIt is in that garden of the Temple convent, that stood that famous\nchestnut-tree which was renowned as the finest and the largest in\nFrance, and which bore the reputation among the good people of the\neighteenth century of being the father of all the chestnut trees of the\nrealm.\n\nAs we have said, this convent of the Temple was occupied by Benedictines\nof the Perpetual Adoration, Benedictines quite different from those who\ndepended on Citeaux. This order of the Perpetual Adoration is not very\nancient and does not go back more than two hundred years. In 1649 the\nholy sacrament was profaned on two occasions a few days apart, in two\nchurches in Paris, at Saint-Sulpice and at Saint-Jean en Greve, a rare\nand frightful sacrilege which set the whole town in an uproar. M. the\nPrior and Vicar-General of Saint-Germain des Pres ordered a solemn\nprocession of all his clergy, in which the Pope's Nuncio officiated.\nBut this expiation did not satisfy two sainted women, Madame Courtin,\nMarquise de Boucs, and the Comtesse de Chateauvieux. This outrage\ncommitted on \"the most holy sacrament of the altar,\" though but\ntemporary, would not depart from these holy souls, and it seemed to\nthem that it could only be extenuated by a \"Perpetual Adoration\" in some\nfemale monastery. Both of them, one in 1652, the other in 1653, made\ndonations of notable sums to Mother Catherine de Bar, called of the Holy\nSacrament, a Benedictine nun, for the purpose of founding, to this pious\nend, a monastery of the order of Saint-Benoit; the first permission for\nthis foundation was given to Mother Catherine de Bar by M. de Metz, Abbe\nof Saint-Germain, \"on condition that no woman could be received unless\nshe contributed three hundred livres income, which amounts to six\nthousand livres, to the principal.\" After the Abbe of Saint-Germain, the\nking accorded letters-patent; and all the rest, abbatial charter, and\nroyal letters, was confirmed in 1654 by the Chamber of Accounts and the\nParliament.\n\nSuch is the origin of the legal consecration of the establishment of the\nBenedictines of the Perpetual Adoration of the Holy Sacrament at Paris.\nTheir first convent was \"a new building\" in the Rue Cassette, out of the\ncontributions of Mesdames de Boucs and de Chateauvieux.\n\nThis order, as it will be seen, was not to be confounded with\nthe Benedictine nuns of Citeaux. It mounted back to the Abbe of\nSaint-Germain des Pres, in the same manner that the ladies of the Sacred\nHeart go back to the general of the Jesuits, and the sisters of charity\nto the general of the Lazarists.\n\nIt was also totally different from the Bernardines of the Petit-Picpus,\nwhose interior we have just shown. In 1657, Pope Alexander VII. had\nauthorized, by a special brief, the Bernardines of the Rue Petit-Picpus,\nto practise the Perpetual Adoration like the Benedictine nuns of the\nHoly Sacrament. But the two orders remained distinct none the less.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI--END OF THE PETIT-PICPUS\n\nAt the beginning of the Restoration, the convent of the Petit-Picpus\nwas in its decay; this forms a part of the general death of the order,\nwhich, after the eighteenth century, has been disappearing like all\nthe religious orders. Contemplation is, like prayer, one of humanity's\nneeds; but, like everything which the Revolution touched, it will be\ntransformed, and from being hostile to social progress, it will become\nfavorable to it.\n\nThe house of the Petit-Picpus was becoming rapidly depopulated. In 1840,\nthe Little Convent had disappeared, the school had disappeared. There\nwere no longer any old women, nor young girls; the first were dead, the\nlatter had taken their departure. Volaverunt.\n\nThe rule of the Perpetual Adoration is so rigid in its nature that it\nalarms, vocations recoil before it, the order receives no recruits. In\n1845, it still obtained lay-sisters here and there. But of professed\nnuns, none at all. Forty years ago, the nuns numbered nearly a hundred;\nfifteen years ago there were not more than twenty-eight of them. How\nmany are there to-day? In 1847, the prioress was young, a sign that\nthe circle of choice was restricted. She was not forty years old. In\nproportion as the number diminishes, the fatigue increases, the service\nof each becomes more painful; the moment could then be seen drawing near\nwhen there would be but a dozen bent and aching shoulders to bear the\nheavy rule of Saint-Benoit. The burden is implacable, and remains the\nsame for the few as for the many. It weighs down, it crushes. Thus they\ndie. At the period when the author of this book still lived in Paris,\ntwo died. One was twenty-five years old, the other twenty-three. This\nlatter can say, like Julia Alpinula: \"Hic jaceo. Vixi annos viginti et\ntres.\" It is in consequence of this decay that the convent gave up the\neducation of girls.\n\nWe have not felt able to pass before this extraordinary house without\nentering it, and without introducing the minds which accompany us, and\nwhich are listening to our tale, to the profit of some, perchance, of\nthe melancholy history of Jean Valjean. We have penetrated into this\ncommunity, full of those old practices which seem so novel to-day. It\nis the closed garden, hortus conclusus. We have spoken of this singular\nplace in detail, but with respect, in so far, at least, as detail and\nrespect are compatible. We do not understand all, but we insult nothing.\nWe are equally far removed from the hosanna of Joseph de Maistre, who\nwound up by anointing the executioner, and from the sneer of Voltaire,\nwho even goes so far as to ridicule the cross.\n\nAn illogical act on Voltaire's part, we may remark, by the way; for\nVoltaire would have defended Jesus as he defended Calas; and even\nfor those who deny superhuman incarnations, what does the crucifix\nrepresent? The assassinated sage.\n\nIn this nineteenth century, the religious idea is undergoing a crisis.\nPeople are unlearning certain things, and they do well, provided that,\nwhile unlearning them they learn this: There is no vacuum in the human\nheart. Certain demolitions take place, and it is well that they do, but\non condition that they are followed by reconstructions.\n\nIn the meantime, let us study things which are no more. It is necessary\nto know them, if only for the purpose of avoiding them. The counterfeits\nof the past assume false names, and gladly call themselves the future.\nThis spectre, this past, is given to falsifying its own passport. Let\nus inform ourselves of the trap. Let us be on our guard. The past has a\nvisage, superstition, and a mask, hypocrisy. Let us denounce the visage\nand let us tear off the mask.\n\nAs for convents, they present a complex problem,--a question of\ncivilization, which condemns them; a question of liberty, which protects\nthem.\n\n\n\n\nBOOK SEVENTH.--PARENTHESIS\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I--THE CONVENT AS AN ABSTRACT IDEA\n\nThis book is a drama, whose leading personage is the Infinite.\n\nMan is the second.\n\nSuch being the case, and a convent having happened to be on our road, it\nhas been our duty to enter it. Why? Because the convent, which is common\nto the Orient as well as to the Occident, to antiquity as well as to\nmodern times, to paganism, to Buddhism, to Mahometanism, as well as to\nChristianity, is one of the optical apparatuses applied by man to the\nInfinite.\n\nThis is not the place for enlarging disproportionately on certain\nideas; nevertheless, while absolutely maintaining our reserves, our\nrestrictions, and even our indignations, we must say that every time we\nencounter man in the Infinite, either well or ill understood, we feel\nourselves overpowered with respect. There is, in the synagogue, in the\nmosque, in the pagoda, in the wigwam, a hideous side which we execrate,\nand a sublime side, which we adore. What a contemplation for the mind,\nand what endless food for thought, is the reverberation of God upon the\nhuman wall!\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II--THE CONVENT AS AN HISTORICAL FACT\n\nFrom the point of view of history, of reason, and of truth, monasticism\nis condemned. Monasteries, when they abound in a nation, are clogs in\nits circulation, cumbrous establishments, centres of idleness where\ncentres of labor should exist. Monastic communities are to the great\nsocial community what the mistletoe is to the oak, what the wart is\nto the human body. Their prosperity and their fatness mean the\nimpoverishment of the country. The monastic regime, good at the\nbeginning of civilization, useful in the reduction of the brutal by the\nspiritual, is bad when peoples have reached their manhood. Moreover,\nwhen it becomes relaxed, and when it enters into its period of disorder,\nit becomes bad for the very reasons which rendered it salutary in its\nperiod of purity, because it still continues to set the example.\n\nClaustration has had its day. Cloisters, useful in the early education\nof modern civilization, have embarrassed its growth, and are injurious\nto its development. So far as institution and formation with relation\nto man are concerned, monasteries, which were good in the tenth century,\nquestionable in the fifteenth, are detestable in the nineteenth. The\nleprosy of monasticism has gnawed nearly to a skeleton two wonderful\nnations, Italy and Spain; the one the light, the other the splendor of\nEurope for centuries; and, at the present day, these two illustrious\npeoples are but just beginning to convalesce, thanks to the healthy and\nvigorous hygiene of 1789 alone.\n\nThe convent--the ancient female convent in particular, such as it still\npresents itself on the threshold of this century, in Italy, in Austria,\nin Spain--is one of the most sombre concretions of the Middle Ages. The\ncloister, that cloister, is the point of intersection of horrors. The\nCatholic cloister, properly speaking, is wholly filled with the black\nradiance of death.\n\nThe Spanish convent is the most funereal of all. There rise, in\nobscurity, beneath vaults filled with gloom, beneath domes vague with\nshadow, massive altars of Babel, as high as cathedrals; there immense\nwhite crucifixes hang from chains in the dark; there are extended, all\nnude on the ebony, great Christs of ivory; more than bleeding,--bloody;\nhideous and magnificent, with their elbows displaying the bones, their\nknee-pans showing their integuments, their wounds showing their flesh,\ncrowned with silver thorns, nailed with nails of gold, with blood drops\nof rubies on their brows, and diamond tears in their eyes. The diamonds\nand rubies seem wet, and make veiled beings in the shadow below weep,\ntheir sides bruised with the hair shirt and their iron-tipped scourges,\ntheir breasts crushed with wicker hurdles, their knees excoriated with\nprayer; women who think themselves wives, spectres who think themselves\nseraphim. Do these women think? No. Have they any will? No. Do they\nlove? No. Do they live? No. Their nerves have turned to bone; their\nbones have turned to stone. Their veil is of woven night. Their breath\nunder their veil resembles the indescribably tragic respiration of\ndeath. The abbess, a spectre, sanctifies them and terrifies them.\nThe immaculate one is there, and very fierce. Such are the ancient\nmonasteries of Spain. Lairs of terrible devotion, caverns of virgins,\nferocious places.\n\nCatholic Spain is more Roman than Rome herself. The Spanish convent was,\nabove all others, the Catholic convent. There was a flavor of the Orient\nabout it. The archbishop, the kislar-aga of heaven, locked up and kept\nwatch over this seraglio of souls reserved for God. The nun was the\nodalisque, the priest was the eunuch. The fervent were chosen in dreams\nand possessed Christ. At night, the beautiful, nude young man descended\nfrom the cross and became the ecstasy of the cloistered one. Lofty walls\nguarded the mystic sultana, who had the crucified for her sultan, from\nall living distraction. A glance on the outer world was infidelity. The\nin pace replaced the leather sack. That which was cast into the sea in\nthe East was thrown into the ground in the West. In both quarters, women\nwrung their hands; the waves for the first, the grave for the last; here\nthe drowned, there the buried. Monstrous parallel.\n\nTo-day the upholders of the past, unable to deny these things, have\nadopted the expedient of smiling at them. There has come into fashion\na strange and easy manner of suppressing the revelations of history, of\ninvalidating the commentaries of philosophy, of eliding all embarrassing\nfacts and all gloomy questions. A matter for declamations, say the\nclever. Declamations, repeat the foolish. Jean-Jacques a declaimer;\nDiderot a declaimer; Voltaire on Calas, Labarre, and Sirven, declaimers.\nI know not who has recently discovered that Tacitus was a declaimer,\nthat Nero was a victim, and that pity is decidedly due to \"that poor\nHolofernes.\"\n\nFacts, however, are awkward things to disconcert, and they are\nobstinate. The author of this book has seen, with his own eyes, eight\nleagues distant from Brussels,--there are relics of the Middle Ages\nthere which are attainable for everybody,--at the Abbey of Villers, the\nhole of the oubliettes, in the middle of the field which was formerly\nthe courtyard of the cloister, and on the banks of the Thil, four stone\ndungeons, half under ground, half under the water. They were in pace.\nEach of these dungeons has the remains of an iron door, a vault, and a\ngrated opening which, on the outside, is two feet above the level of the\nriver, and on the inside, six feet above the level of the ground. Four\nfeet of river flow past along the outside wall. The ground is always\nsoaked. The occupant of the in pace had this wet soil for his bed. In\none of these dungeons, there is a fragment of an iron necklet riveted to\nthe wall; in another, there can be seen a square box made of four slabs\nof granite, too short for a person to lie down in, too low for him to\nstand upright in. A human being was put inside, with a coverlid of stone\non top. This exists. It can be seen. It can be touched. These in pace,\nthese dungeons, these iron hinges, these necklets, that lofty peep-hole\non a level with the river's current, that box of stone closed with a lid\nof granite like a tomb, with this difference, that the dead man here\nwas a living being, that soil which is but mud, that vault hole, those\noozing walls,--what declaimers!\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III--ON WHAT CONDITIONS ONE CAN RESPECT THE PAST\n\nMonasticism, such as it existed in Spain, and such as it still exists in\nThibet, is a sort of phthisis for civilization. It stops life short. It\nsimply depopulates. Claustration, castration. It has been the scourge\nof Europe. Add to this the violence so often done to the conscience, the\nforced vocations, feudalism bolstered up by the cloister, the right of\nthe first-born pouring the excess of the family into monasticism, the\nferocities of which we have just spoken, the in pace, the closed mouths,\nthe walled-up brains, so many unfortunate minds placed in the dungeon\nof eternal vows, the taking of the habit, the interment of living souls.\nAdd individual tortures to national degradations, and, whoever you\nmay be, you will shudder before the frock and the veil,--those two\nwinding-sheets of human devising. Nevertheless, at certain points and in\ncertain places, in spite of philosophy, in spite of progress, the spirit\nof the cloister persists in the midst of the nineteenth century, and\na singular ascetic recrudescence is, at this moment, astonishing\nthe civilized world. The obstinacy of antiquated institutions in\nperpetuating themselves resembles the stubbornness of the rancid perfume\nwhich should claim our hair, the pretensions of the spoiled fish which\nshould persist in being eaten, the persecution of the child's garment\nwhich should insist on clothing the man, the tenderness of corpses which\nshould return to embrace the living.\n\n\"Ingrates!\" says the garment, \"I protected you in inclement weather. Why\nwill you have nothing to do with me?\" \"I have just come from the deep\nsea,\" says the fish. \"I have been a rose,\" says the perfume. \"I have\nloved you,\" says the corpse. \"I have civilized you,\" says the convent.\n\nTo this there is but one reply: \"In former days.\"\n\nTo dream of the indefinite prolongation of defunct things, and of the\ngovernment of men by embalming, to restore dogmas in a bad condition,\nto regild shrines, to patch up cloisters, to rebless reliquaries, to\nrefurnish superstitions, to revictual fanaticisms, to put new handles\non holy water brushes and militarism, to reconstitute monasticism and\nmilitarism, to believe in the salvation of society by the multiplication\nof parasites, to force the past on the present,--this seems strange.\nStill, there are theorists who hold such theories. These theorists,\nwho are in other respects people of intelligence, have a very simple\nprocess; they apply to the past a glazing which they call social\norder, divine right, morality, family, the respect of elders, antique\nauthority, sacred tradition, legitimacy, religion; and they go about\nshouting, \"Look! take this, honest people.\" This logic was known to the\nancients. The soothsayers practise it. They rubbed a black heifer over\nwith chalk, and said, \"She is white, Bos cretatus.\"\n\nAs for us, we respect the past here and there, and we spare it, above\nall, provided that it consents to be dead. If it insists on being alive,\nwe attack it, and we try to kill it.\n\nSuperstitions, bigotries, affected devotion, prejudices, those forms all\nforms as they are, are tenacious of life; they have teeth and nails in\ntheir smoke, and they must be clasped close, body to body, and war must\nbe made on them, and that without truce; for it is one of the fatalities\nof humanity to be condemned to eternal combat with phantoms. It is\ndifficult to seize darkness by the throat, and to hurl it to the earth.\n\nA convent in France, in the broad daylight of the nineteenth century, is\na college of owls facing the light. A cloister, caught in the very act\nof asceticism, in the very heart of the city of '89 and of 1830 and\nof 1848, Rome blossoming out in Paris, is an anachronism. In ordinary\ntimes, in order to dissolve an anachronism and to cause it to vanish,\none has only to make it spell out the date. But we are not in ordinary\ntimes.\n\nLet us fight.\n\nLet us fight, but let us make a distinction. The peculiar property of\ntruth is never to commit excesses. What need has it of exaggeration?\nThere is that which it is necessary to destroy, and there is that which\nit is simply necessary to elucidate and examine. What a force is kindly\nand serious examination! Let us not apply a flame where only a light is\nrequired.\n\nSo, given the nineteenth century, we are opposed, as a general\nproposition, and among all peoples, in Asia as well as in Europe,\nin India as well as in Turkey, to ascetic claustration. Whoever says\ncloister, says marsh. Their putrescence is evident, their stagnation is\nunhealthy, their fermentation infects people with fever, and etiolates\nthem; their multiplication becomes a plague of Egypt. We cannot think\nwithout affright of those lands where fakirs, bonzes, santons, Greek\nmonks, marabouts, talapoins, and dervishes multiply even like swarms of\nvermin.\n\nThis said, the religious question remains. This question has certain\nmysterious, almost formidable sides; may we be permitted to look at it\nfixedly.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV--THE CONVENT FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF PRINCIPLES\n\nMen unite themselves and dwell in communities. By virtue of what right?\nBy virtue of the right of association.\n\nThey shut themselves up at home. By virtue of what right? By virtue of\nthe right which every man has to open or shut his door.\n\nThey do not come forth. By virtue of what right? By virtue of the right\nto go and come, which implies the right to remain at home.\n\nThere, at home, what do they do?\n\nThey speak in low tones; they drop their eyes; they toil. They renounce\nthe world, towns, sensualities, pleasures, vanities, pride, interests.\nThey are clothed in coarse woollen or coarse linen. Not one of them\npossesses in his own right anything whatever. On entering there, each\none who was rich makes himself poor. What he has, he gives to all. He\nwho was what is called noble, a gentleman and a lord, is the equal of\nhim who was a peasant. The cell is identical for all. All undergo the\nsame tonsure, wear the same frock, eat the same black bread, sleep on\nthe same straw, die on the same ashes. The same sack on their backs, the\nsame rope around their loins. If the decision has been to go barefoot,\nall go barefoot. There may be a prince among them; that prince is the\nsame shadow as the rest. No titles. Even family names have disappeared.\nThey bear only first names. All are bowed beneath the equality of\nbaptismal names. They have dissolved the carnal family, and constituted\nin their community a spiritual family. They have no other relatives than\nall men. They succor the poor, they care for the sick. They elect those\nwhom they obey. They call each other \"my brother.\"\n\nYou stop me and exclaim, \"But that is the ideal convent!\"\n\nIt is sufficient that it may be the possible convent, that I should take\nnotice of it.\n\nThence it results that, in the preceding book, I have spoken of a\nconvent with respectful accents. The Middle Ages cast aside, Asia cast\naside, the historical and political question held in reserve, from the\npurely philosophical point of view, outside the requirements of militant\npolicy, on condition that the monastery shall be absolutely a voluntary\nmatter and shall contain only consenting parties, I shall always\nconsider a cloistered community with a certain attentive, and, in some\nrespects, a deferential gravity.\n\nWherever there is a community, there is a commune; where there is a\ncommune, there is right. The monastery is the product of the formula:\nEquality, Fraternity. Oh! how grand is liberty! And what a splendid\ntransfiguration! Liberty suffices to transform the monastery into a\nrepublic.\n\nLet us continue.\n\nBut these men, or these women who are behind these four walls. They\ndress themselves in coarse woollen, they are equals, they call each\nother brothers, that is well; but they do something else?\n\nYes.\n\nWhat?\n\nThey gaze on the darkness, they kneel, and they clasp their hands.\n\nWhat does this signify?\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V--PRAYER\n\nThey pray.\n\nTo whom?\n\nTo God.\n\nTo pray to God,--what is the meaning of these words?\n\nIs there an infinite beyond us? Is that infinite there, inherent,\npermanent; necessarily substantial, since it is infinite; and because,\nif it lacked matter it would be bounded; necessarily intelligent, since\nit is infinite, and because, if it lacked intelligence, it would end\nthere? Does this infinite awaken in us the idea of essence, while we can\nattribute to ourselves only the idea of existence? In other terms, is it\nnot the absolute, of which we are only the relative?\n\nAt the same time that there is an infinite without us, is there not\nan infinite within us? Are not these two infinites (what an alarming\nplural!) superposed, the one upon the other? Is not this second\ninfinite, so to speak, subjacent to the first? Is it not the latter's\nmirror, reflection, echo, an abyss which is concentric with another\nabyss? Is this second infinity intelligent also? Does it think? Does\nit love? Does it will? If these two infinities are intelligent, each of\nthem has a will principle, and there is an _I_ in the upper infinity as\nthere is an _I_ in the lower infinity. The _I_ below is the soul; the\n_I_ on high is God.\n\nTo place the infinity here below in contact, by the medium of thought,\nwith the infinity on high, is called praying.\n\nLet us take nothing from the human mind; to suppress is bad. We must\nreform and transform. Certain faculties in man are directed towards\nthe Unknown; thought, revery, prayer. The Unknown is an ocean. What\nis conscience? It is the compass of the Unknown. Thought, revery,\nprayer,--these are great and mysterious radiations. Let us respect them.\nWhither go these majestic irradiations of the soul? Into the shadow;\nthat is to say, to the light.\n\nThe grandeur of democracy is to disown nothing and to deny nothing of\nhumanity. Close to the right of the man, beside it, at the least, there\nexists the right of the soul.\n\nTo crush fanaticism and to venerate the infinite, such is the law. Let\nus not confine ourselves to prostrating ourselves before the tree of\ncreation, and to the contemplation of its branches full of stars. We\nhave a duty to labor over the human soul, to defend the mystery against\nthe miracle, to adore the incomprehensible and reject the absurd,\nto admit, as an inexplicable fact, only what is necessary, to purify\nbelief, to remove superstitions from above religion; to clear God of\ncaterpillars.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI--THE ABSOLUTE GOODNESS OF PRAYER\n\nWith regard to the modes of prayer, all are good, provided that they are\nsincere. Turn your book upside down and be in the infinite.\n\nThere is, as we know, a philosophy which denies the infinite. There is\nalso a philosophy, pathologically classified, which denies the sun; this\nphilosophy is called blindness.\n\nTo erect a sense which we lack into a source of truth, is a fine blind\nman's self-sufficiency.\n\nThe curious thing is the haughty, superior, and compassionate airs which\nthis groping philosophy assumes towards the philosophy which beholds\nGod. One fancies he hears a mole crying, \"I pity them with their sun!\"\n\nThere are, as we know, powerful and illustrious atheists. At bottom, led\nback to the truth by their very force, they are not absolutely sure that\nthey are atheists; it is with them only a question of definition, and in\nany case, if they do not believe in God, being great minds, they prove\nGod.\n\nWe salute them as philosophers, while inexorably denouncing their\nphilosophy.\n\nLet us go on.\n\nThe remarkable thing about it is, also, their facility in paying\nthemselves off with words. A metaphysical school of the North,\nimpregnated to some extent with fog, has fancied that it has worked a\nrevolution in human understanding by replacing the word Force with the\nword Will.\n\nTo say: \"the plant wills,\" instead of: \"the plant grows\": this would be\nfecund in results, indeed, if we were to add: \"the universe wills.\" Why?\nBecause it would come to this: the plant wills, therefore it has an _I_;\nthe universe wills, therefore it has a God.\n\nAs for us, who, however, in contradistinction to this school, reject\nnothing a priori, a will in the plant, accepted by this school, appears\nto us more difficult to admit than a will in the universe denied by it.\n\nTo deny the will of the infinite, that is to say, God, is impossible on\nany other conditions than a denial of the infinite. We have demonstrated\nthis.\n\nThe negation of the infinite leads straight to nihilism. Everything\nbecomes \"a mental conception.\"\n\nWith nihilism, no discussion is possible; for the nihilist logic doubts\nthe existence of its interlocutor, and is not quite sure that it exists\nitself.\n\nFrom its point of view, it is possible that it may be for itself, only\n\"a mental conception.\"\n\nOnly, it does not perceive that all which it has denied it admits in the\nlump, simply by the utterance of the word, mind.\n\nIn short, no way is open to the thought by a philosophy which makes all\nend in the monosyllable, No.\n\nTo No there is only one reply, Yes.\n\nNihilism has no point.\n\nThere is no such thing as nothingness. Zero does not exist. Everything\nis something. Nothing is nothing.\n\nMan lives by affirmation even more than by bread.\n\nEven to see and to show does not suffice. Philosophy should be an\nenergy; it should have for effort and effect to ameliorate the condition\nof man. Socrates should enter into Adam and produce Marcus Aurelius; in\nother words, the man of wisdom should be made to emerge from the man\nof felicity. Eden should be changed into a Lyceum. Science should be\na cordial. To enjoy,--what a sad aim, and what a paltry ambition! The\nbrute enjoys. To offer thought to the thirst of men, to give them all as\nan elixir the notion of God, to make conscience and science fraternize\nin them, to render them just by this mysterious confrontation; such is\nthe function of real philosophy. Morality is a blossoming out of truths.\nContemplation leads to action. The absolute should be practicable. It is\nnecessary that the ideal should be breathable, drinkable, and eatable to\nthe human mind. It is the ideal which has the right to say: Take, this!\nIt is on this condition that it ceases to be a sterile love of science\nand becomes the one and sovereign mode of human rallying, and that\nphilosophy herself is promoted to religion.\n\nPhilosophy should not be a corbel erected on mystery to gaze upon it\nat its ease, without any other result than that of being convenient to\ncuriosity.\n\nFor our part, adjourning the development of our thought to another\noccasion, we will confine ourselves to saying that we neither understand\nman as a point of departure nor progress as an end, without those two\nforces which are their two motors: faith and love.\n\nProgress is the goal, the ideal is the type.\n\nWhat is this ideal? It is God.\n\nIdeal, absolute, perfection, infinity: identical words.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII--PRECAUTIONS TO BE OBSERVED IN BLAME\n\nHistory and philosophy have eternal duties, which are, at the same time,\nsimple duties; to combat Caiphas the High-priest, Draco the Lawgiver,\nTrimalcion the Legislator, Tiberius the Emperor; this is clear, direct,\nand limpid, and offers no obscurity.\n\nBut the right to live apart, even with its inconveniences and its\nabuses, insists on being stated and taken into account. Cenobitism is a\nhuman problem.\n\nWhen one speaks of convents, those abodes of error, but of innocence,\nof aberration but of good-will, of ignorance but of devotion, of torture\nbut of martyrdom, it always becomes necessary to say either yes or no.\n\nA convent is a contradiction. Its object, salvation; its means thereto,\nsacrifice. The convent is supreme egoism having for its result supreme\nabnegation.\n\nTo abdicate with the object of reigning seems to be the device of\nmonasticism.\n\nIn the cloister, one suffers in order to enjoy. One draws a bill of\nexchange on death. One discounts in terrestrial gloom celestial light.\nIn the cloister, hell is accepted in advance as a post obit on paradise.\n\nThe taking of the veil or the frock is a suicide paid for with eternity.\n\nIt does not seem to us, that on such a subject mockery is permissible.\nAll about it is serious, the good as well as the bad.\n\nThe just man frowns, but never smiles with a malicious sneer. We\nunderstand wrath, but not malice.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII--FAITH, LAW\n\nA few words more.\n\nWe blame the church when she is saturated with intrigues, we despise the\nspiritual which is harsh toward the temporal; but we everywhere honor\nthe thoughtful man.\n\nWe salute the man who kneels.\n\nA faith; this is a necessity for man. Woe to him who believes nothing.\n\nOne is not unoccupied because one is absorbed. There is visible labor\nand invisible labor.\n\nTo contemplate is to labor, to think is to act.\n\nFolded arms toil, clasped hands work. A gaze fixed on heaven is a work.\n\nThales remained motionless for four years. He founded philosophy.\n\nIn our opinion, cenobites are not lazy men, and recluses are not idlers.\n\nTo meditate on the Shadow is a serious thing.\n\nWithout invalidating anything that we have just said, we believe that\na perpetual memory of the tomb is proper for the living. On this point,\nthe priest and the philosopher agree. We must die. The Abbe de la Trappe\nreplies to Horace.\n\nTo mingle with one's life a certain presence of the sepulchre,--this is\nthe law of the sage; and it is the law of the ascetic. In this respect,\nthe ascetic and the sage converge. There is a material growth; we\nadmit it. There is a moral grandeur; we hold to that. Thoughtless and\nvivacious spirits say:--\n\n\"What is the good of those motionless figures on the side of mystery?\nWhat purpose do they serve? What do they do?\"\n\nAlas! In the presence of the darkness which environs us, and which\nawaits us, in our ignorance of what the immense dispersion will make of\nus, we reply: \"There is probably no work more divine than that performed\nby these souls.\" And we add: \"There is probably no work which is more\nuseful.\"\n\nThere certainly must be some who pray constantly for those who never\npray at all.\n\nIn our opinion the whole question lies in the amount of thought that is\nmingled with prayer.\n\nLeibnitz praying is grand, Voltaire adoring is fine. Deo erexit\nVoltaire.\n\nWe are for religion as against religions.\n\nWe are of the number who believe in the wretchedness of orisons, and the\nsublimity of prayer.\n\nMoreover, at this minute which we are now traversing,--a minute which\nwill not, fortunately, leave its impress on the nineteenth century,--at\nthis hour, when so many men have low brows and souls but little\nelevated, among so many mortals whose morality consists in enjoyment,\nand who are busied with the brief and misshapen things of matter,\nwhoever exiles himself seems worthy of veneration to us.\n\nThe monastery is a renunciation. Sacrifice wrongly directed is still\nsacrifice. To mistake a grave error for a duty has a grandeur of its\nown.\n\nTaken by itself, and ideally, and in order to examine the truth on all\nsides until all aspects have been impartially exhausted, the monastery,\nthe female convent in particular,--for in our century it is woman who\nsuffers the most, and in this exile of the cloister there is something\nof protestation,--the female convent has incontestably a certain\nmajesty.\n\nThis cloistered existence which is so austere, so depressing, a few of\nwhose features we have just traced, is not life, for it is not liberty;\nit is not the tomb, for it is not plenitude; it is the strange place\nwhence one beholds, as from the crest of a lofty mountain, on one side\nthe abyss where we are, on the other, the abyss whither we shall go; it\nis the narrow and misty frontier separating two worlds, illuminated\nand obscured by both at the same time, where the ray of life which has\nbecome enfeebled is mingled with the vague ray of death; it is the half\nobscurity of the tomb.\n\nWe, who do not believe what these women believe, but who, like them,\nlive by faith,--we have never been able to think without a sort of\ntender and religious terror, without a sort of pity, that is full of\nenvy, of those devoted, trembling and trusting creatures, of these\nhumble and august souls, who dare to dwell on the very brink of the\nmystery, waiting between the world which is closed and heaven which is\nnot yet open, turned towards the light which one cannot see, possessing\nthe sole happiness of thinking that they know where it is, aspiring\ntowards the gulf, and the unknown, their eyes fixed motionless on the\ndarkness, kneeling, bewildered, stupefied, shuddering, half lifted, at\ntimes, by the deep breaths of eternity.\n\n\n\n\nBOOK EIGHTH.--CEMETERIES TAKE THAT WHICH IS COMMITTED THEM\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I--WHICH TREATS OF THE MANNER OF ENTERING A CONVENT\n\nIt was into this house that Jean Valjean had, as Fauchelevent expressed\nit, \"fallen from the sky.\"\n\nHe had scaled the wall of the garden which formed the angle of the Rue\nPolonceau. That hymn of the angels which he had heard in the middle\nof the night, was the nuns chanting matins; that hall, of which he had\ncaught a glimpse in the gloom, was the chapel. That phantom which he had\nseen stretched on the ground was the sister who was making reparation;\nthat bell, the sound of which had so strangely surprised him, was the\ngardener's bell attached to the knee of Father Fauchelevent.\n\nCosette once put to bed, Jean Valjean and Fauchelevent had, as we have\nalready seen, supped on a glass of wine and a bit of cheese before a\ngood, crackling fire; then, the only bed in the hut being occupied by\nCosette, each threw himself on a truss of straw.\n\nBefore he shut his eyes, Jean Valjean said: \"I must remain here\nhenceforth.\" This remark trotted through Fauchelevent's head all night\nlong.\n\nTo tell the truth, neither of them slept.\n\nJean Valjean, feeling that he was discovered and that Javert was on\nhis scent, understood that he and Cosette were lost if they returned to\nParis. Then the new storm which had just burst upon him had stranded\nhim in this cloister. Jean Valjean had, henceforth, but one thought,--to\nremain there. Now, for an unfortunate man in his position, this\nconvent was both the safest and the most dangerous of places; the most\ndangerous, because, as no men might enter there, if he were discovered,\nit was a flagrant offence, and Jean Valjean would find but one step\nintervening between the convent and prison; the safest, because, if he\ncould manage to get himself accepted there and remain there, who would\never seek him in such a place? To dwell in an impossible place was\nsafety.\n\nOn his side, Fauchelevent was cudgelling his brains. He began by\ndeclaring to himself that he understood nothing of the matter. How had\nM. Madeleine got there, when the walls were what they were? Cloister\nwalls are not to be stepped over. How did he get there with a child? One\ncannot scale a perpendicular wall with a child in one's arms. Who was\nthat child? Where did they both come from? Since Fauchelevent had lived\nin the convent, he had heard nothing of M. sur M., and he knew nothing\nof what had taken place there. Father Madeleine had an air which\ndiscouraged questions; and besides, Fauchelevent said to himself: \"One\ndoes not question a saint.\" M. Madeleine had preserved all his prestige\nin Fauchelevent's eyes. Only, from some words which Jean Valjean had let\nfall, the gardener thought he could draw the inference that M. Madeleine\nhad probably become bankrupt through the hard times, and that he was\npursued by his creditors; or that he had compromised himself in some\npolitical affair, and was in hiding; which last did not displease\nFauchelevent, who, like many of our peasants of the North, had an\nold fund of Bonapartism about him. While in hiding, M. Madeleine had\nselected the convent as a refuge, and it was quite simple that he should\nwish to remain there. But the inexplicable point, to which Fauchelevent\nreturned constantly and over which he wearied his brain, was that M.\nMadeleine should be there, and that he should have that little girl with\nhim. Fauchelevent saw them, touched them, spoke to them, and still did\nnot believe it possible. The incomprehensible had just made its entrance\ninto Fauchelevent's hut. Fauchelevent groped about amid conjectures, and\ncould see nothing clearly but this: \"M. Madeleine saved my life.\"\nThis certainty alone was sufficient and decided his course. He said to\nhimself: \"It is my turn now.\" He added in his conscience: \"M. Madeleine\ndid not stop to deliberate when it was a question of thrusting himself\nunder the cart for the purpose of dragging me out.\" He made up his mind\nto save M. Madeleine.\n\nNevertheless, he put many questions to himself and made himself divers\nreplies: \"After what he did for me, would I save him if he were a thief?\nJust the same. If he were an assassin, would I save him? Just the same.\nSince he is a saint, shall I save him? Just the same.\"\n\nBut what a problem it was to manage to have him remain in the convent!\nFauchelevent did not recoil in the face of this almost chimerical\nundertaking; this poor peasant of Picardy without any other ladder\nthan his self-devotion, his good will, and a little of that old\nrustic cunning, on this occasion enlisted in the service of a generous\nenterprise, undertook to scale the difficulties of the cloister, and the\nsteep escarpments of the rule of Saint-Benoit. Father Fauchelevent was\nan old man who had been an egoist all his life, and who, towards the end\nof his days, halt, infirm, with no interest left to him in the world,\nfound it sweet to be grateful, and perceiving a generous action to be\nperformed, flung himself upon it like a man, who at the moment when he\nis dying, should find close to his hand a glass of good wine which he\nhad never tasted, and should swallow it with avidity. We may add,\nthat the air which he had breathed for many years in this convent had\ndestroyed all personality in him, and had ended by rendering a good\naction of some kind absolutely necessary to him.\n\nSo he took his resolve: to devote himself to M. Madeleine.\n\nWe have just called him a poor peasant of Picardy. That description\nis just, but incomplete. At the point of this story which we have now\nreached, a little of Father Fauchelevent's physiology becomes useful.\nHe was a peasant, but he had been a notary, which added trickery to his\ncunning, and penetration to his ingenuousness. Having, through various\ncauses, failed in his business, he had descended to the calling of a\ncarter and a laborer. But, in spite of oaths and lashings, which horses\nseem to require, something of the notary had lingered in him. He had\nsome natural wit; he talked good grammar; he conversed, which is a rare\nthing in a village; and the other peasants said of him: \"He talks almost\nlike a gentleman with a hat.\" Fauchelevent belonged, in fact, to that\nspecies, which the impertinent and flippant vocabulary of the last\ncentury qualified as demi-bourgeois, demi-lout, and which the metaphors\nshowered by the chateau upon the thatched cottage ticketed in the\npigeon-hole of the plebeian: rather rustic, rather citified; pepper and\nsalt. Fauchelevent, though sorely tried and harshly used by fate,\nworn out, a sort of poor, threadbare old soul, was, nevertheless, an\nimpulsive man, and extremely spontaneous in his actions; a precious\nquality which prevents one from ever being wicked. His defects and his\nvices, for he had some, were all superficial; in short, his physiognomy\nwas of the kind which succeeds with an observer. His aged face had none\nof those disagreeable wrinkles at the top of the forehead, which signify\nmalice or stupidity.\n\nAt daybreak, Father Fauchelevent opened his eyes, after having done an\nenormous deal of thinking, and beheld M. Madeleine seated on his truss\nof straw, and watching Cosette's slumbers. Fauchelevent sat up and\nsaid:--\n\n\"Now that you are here, how are you going to contrive to enter?\"\n\nThis remark summed up the situation and aroused Jean Valjean from his\nrevery.\n\nThe two men took counsel together.\n\n\"In the first place,\" said Fauchelevent, \"you will begin by not setting\nfoot outside of this chamber, either you or the child. One step in the\ngarden and we are done for.\"\n\n\"That is true.\"\n\n\"Monsieur Madeleine,\" resumed Fauchelevent, \"you have arrived at a very\nauspicious moment, I mean to say a very inauspicious moment; one of\nthe ladies is very ill. This will prevent them from looking much in our\ndirection. It seems that she is dying. The prayers of the forty hours\nare being said. The whole community is in confusion. That occupies them.\nThe one who is on the point of departure is a saint. In fact, we are\nall saints here; all the difference between them and me is that they say\n'our cell,' and that I say 'my cabin.' The prayers for the dying are to\nbe said, and then the prayers for the dead. We shall be at peace here\nfor to-day; but I will not answer for to-morrow.\"\n\n\"Still,\" observed Jean Valjean, \"this cottage is in the niche of the\nwall, it is hidden by a sort of ruin, there are trees, it is not visible\nfrom the convent.\"\n\n\"And I add that the nuns never come near it.\"\n\n\"Well?\" said Jean Valjean.\n\nThe interrogation mark which accentuated this \"well\" signified:\n\"it seems to me that one may remain concealed here?\" It was to this\ninterrogation point that Fauchelevent responded:--\n\n\"There are the little girls.\"\n\n\"What little girls?\" asked Jean Valjean.\n\nJust as Fauchelevent opened his mouth to explain the words which he had\nuttered, a bell emitted one stroke.\n\n\"The nun is dead,\" said he. \"There is the knell.\"\n\nAnd he made a sign to Jean Valjean to listen.\n\nThe bell struck a second time.\n\n\"It is the knell, Monsieur Madeleine. The bell will continue to strike\nonce a minute for twenty-four hours, until the body is taken from the\nchurch.--You see, they play. At recreation hours it suffices to have a\nball roll aside, to send them all hither, in spite of prohibitions, to\nhunt and rummage for it all about here. Those cherubs are devils.\"\n\n\"Who?\" asked Jean Valjean.\n\n\"The little girls. You would be very quickly discovered. They would\nshriek: 'Oh! a man!' There is no danger to-day. There will be no\nrecreation hour. The day will be entirely devoted to prayers. You hear\nthe bell. As I told you, a stroke each minute. It is the death knell.\"\n\n\"I understand, Father Fauchelevent. There are pupils.\"\n\nAnd Jean Valjean thought to himself:--\n\n\"Here is Cosette's education already provided.\"\n\nFauchelevent exclaimed:--\n\n\"Pardine! There are little girls indeed! And they would bawl around you!\nAnd they would rush off! To be a man here is to have the plague. You see\nhow they fasten a bell to my paw as though I were a wild beast.\"\n\nJean Valjean fell into more and more profound thought.--\"This convent\nwould be our salvation,\" he murmured.\n\nThen he raised his voice:--\n\n\"Yes, the difficulty is to remain here.\"\n\n\"No,\" said Fauchelevent, \"the difficulty is to get out.\"\n\nJean Valjean felt the blood rush back to his heart.\n\n\"To get out!\"\n\n\"Yes, Monsieur Madeleine. In order to return here it is first necessary\nto get out.\"\n\nAnd after waiting until another stroke of the knell had sounded,\nFauchelevent went on:--\n\n\"You must not be found here in this fashion. Whence come you? For me,\nyou fall from heaven, because I know you; but the nuns require one to\nenter by the door.\"\n\nAll at once they heard a rather complicated pealing from another bell.\n\n\"Ah!\" said Fauchelevent, \"they are ringing up the vocal mothers. They\nare going to the chapter. They always hold a chapter when any one dies.\nShe died at daybreak. People generally do die at daybreak. But cannot\nyou get out by the way in which you entered? Come, I do not ask for the\nsake of questioning you, but how did you get in?\"\n\nJean Valjean turned pale; the very thought of descending again into\nthat terrible street made him shudder. You make your way out of a forest\nfilled with tigers, and once out of it, imagine a friendly counsel that\nshall advise you to return thither! Jean Valjean pictured to himself the\nwhole police force still engaged in swarming in that quarter, agents on\nthe watch, sentinels everywhere, frightful fists extended towards his\ncollar, Javert at the corner of the intersection of the streets perhaps.\n\n\"Impossible!\" said he. \"Father Fauchelevent, say that I fell from the\nsky.\"\n\n\"But I believe it, I believe it,\" retorted Fauchelevent. \"You have no\nneed to tell me that. The good God must have taken you in his hand for\nthe purpose of getting a good look at you close to, and then dropped\nyou. Only, he meant to place you in a man's convent; he made a mistake.\nCome, there goes another peal, that is to order the porter to go and\ninform the municipality that the dead-doctor is to come here and view a\ncorpse. All that is the ceremony of dying. These good ladies are not\nat all fond of that visit. A doctor is a man who does not believe in\nanything. He lifts the veil. Sometimes he lifts something else too. How\nquickly they have had the doctor summoned this time! What is the matter?\nYour little one is still asleep. What is her name?\"\n\n\"Cosette.\"\n\n\"She is your daughter? You are her grandfather, that is?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"It will be easy enough for her to get out of here. I have my service\ndoor which opens on the courtyard. I knock. The porter opens; I have\nmy vintage basket on my back, the child is in it, I go out. Father\nFauchelevent goes out with his basket--that is perfectly natural. You\nwill tell the child to keep very quiet. She will be under the cover. I\nwill leave her for whatever time is required with a good old friend, a\nfruit-seller whom I know in the Rue Chemin-Vert, who is deaf, and who\nhas a little bed. I will shout in the fruit-seller's ear, that she is a\nniece of mine, and that she is to keep her for me until to-morrow. Then\nthe little one will re-enter with you; for I will contrive to have you\nre-enter. It must be done. But how will you manage to get out?\"\n\nJean Valjean shook his head.\n\n\"No one must see me, the whole point lies there, Father Fauchelevent.\nFind some means of getting me out in a basket, under cover, like\nCosette.\"\n\nFauchelevent scratched the lobe of his ear with the middle finger of his\nleft hand, a sign of serious embarrassment.\n\nA third peal created a diversion.\n\n\"That is the dead-doctor taking his departure,\" said Fauchelevent. \"He\nhas taken a look and said: 'She is dead, that is well.' When the doctor\nhas signed the passport for paradise, the undertaker's company sends a\ncoffin. If it is a mother, the mothers lay her out; if she is a sister,\nthe sisters lay her out. After which, I nail her up. That forms a part\nof my gardener's duty. A gardener is a bit of a grave-digger. She is\nplaced in a lower hall of the church which communicates with the street,\nand into which no man may enter save the doctor of the dead. I don't\ncount the undertaker's men and myself as men. It is in that hall that I\nnail up the coffin. The undertaker's men come and get it, and whip\nup, coachman! that's the way one goes to heaven. They fetch a box with\nnothing in it, they take it away again with something in it. That's what\na burial is like. De profundis.\"\n\nA horizontal ray of sunshine lightly touched the face of the sleeping\nCosette, who lay with her mouth vaguely open, and had the air of an\nangel drinking in the light. Jean Valjean had fallen to gazing at her.\nHe was no longer listening to Fauchelevent.\n\nThat one is not listened to is no reason for preserving silence. The\ngood old gardener went on tranquilly with his babble:--\n\n\"The grave is dug in the Vaugirard cemetery. They declare that they are\ngoing to suppress that Vaugirard cemetery. It is an ancient cemetery\nwhich is outside the regulations, which has no uniform, and which is\ngoing to retire. It is a shame, for it is convenient. I have a friend\nthere, Father Mestienne, the grave-digger. The nuns here possess one\nprivilege, it is to be taken to that cemetery at nightfall. There is\na special permission from the Prefecture on their behalf. But how many\nevents have happened since yesterday! Mother Crucifixion is dead, and\nFather Madeleine--\"\n\n\"Is buried,\" said Jean Valjean, smiling sadly.\n\nFauchelevent caught the word.\n\n\"Goodness! if you were here for good, it would be a real burial.\"\n\nA fourth peal burst out. Fauchelevent hastily detached the belled\nknee-cap from its nail and buckled it on his knee again.\n\n\"This time it is for me. The Mother Prioress wants me. Good, now I am\npricking myself on the tongue of my buckle. Monsieur Madeleine, don't\nstir from here, and wait for me. Something new has come up. If you are\nhungry, there is wine, bread and cheese.\"\n\nAnd he hastened out of the hut, crying: \"Coming! coming!\"\n\nJean Valjean watched him hurrying across the garden as fast as his\ncrooked leg would permit, casting a sidelong glance by the way on his\nmelon patch.\n\nLess than ten minutes later, Father Fauchelevent, whose bell put the\nnuns in his road to flight, tapped gently at a door, and a gentle voice\nreplied: \"Forever! Forever!\" that is to say: \"Enter.\"\n\nThe door was the one leading to the parlor reserved for seeing the\ngardener on business. This parlor adjoined the chapter hall. The\nprioress, seated on the only chair in the parlor, was waiting for\nFauchelevent.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II--FAUCHELEVENT IN THE PRESENCE OF A DIFFICULTY\n\nIt is the peculiarity of certain persons and certain professions,\nnotably priests and nuns, to wear a grave and agitated air on critical\noccasions. At the moment when Fauchelevent entered, this double form of\npreoccupation was imprinted on the countenance of the prioress, who was\nthat wise and charming Mademoiselle de Blemeur, Mother Innocente, who\nwas ordinarily cheerful.\n\nThe gardener made a timid bow, and remained at the door of the cell. The\nprioress, who was telling her beads, raised her eyes and said:--\n\n\"Ah! it is you, Father Fauvent.\"\n\nThis abbreviation had been adopted in the convent.\n\nFauchelevent bowed again.\n\n\"Father Fauvent, I have sent for you.\"\n\n\"Here I am, reverend Mother.\"\n\n\"I have something to say to you.\"\n\n\"And so have I,\" said Fauchelevent with a boldness which caused him\ninward terror, \"I have something to say to the very reverend Mother.\"\n\nThe prioress stared at him.\n\n\"Ah! you have a communication to make to me.\"\n\n\"A request.\"\n\n\"Very well, speak.\"\n\nGoodman Fauchelevent, the ex-notary, belonged to the category of\npeasants who have assurance. A certain clever ignorance constitutes a\nforce; you do not distrust it, and you are caught by it. Fauchelevent\nhad been a success during the something more than two years which he had\npassed in the convent. Always solitary and busied about his gardening,\nhe had nothing else to do than to indulge his curiosity. As he was at a\ndistance from all those veiled women passing to and fro, he saw before\nhim only an agitation of shadows. By dint of attention and sharpness\nhe had succeeded in clothing all those phantoms with flesh, and those\ncorpses were alive for him. He was like a deaf man whose sight grows\nkeener, and like a blind man whose hearing becomes more acute. He had\napplied himself to riddling out the significance of the different peals,\nand he had succeeded, so that this taciturn and enigmatical cloister\npossessed no secrets for him; the sphinx babbled all her secrets in his\near. Fauchelevent knew all and concealed all; that constituted his art.\nThe whole convent thought him stupid. A great merit in religion. The\nvocal mothers made much of Fauchelevent. He was a curious mute. He\ninspired confidence. Moreover, he was regular, and never went out except\nfor well-demonstrated requirements of the orchard and vegetable garden.\nThis discretion of conduct had inured to his credit. None the less, he\nhad set two men to chattering: the porter, in the convent, and he\nknew the singularities of their parlor, and the grave-digger, at\nthe cemetery, and he was acquainted with the peculiarities of their\nsepulture; in this way, he possessed a double light on the subject of\nthese nuns, one as to their life, the other as to their death. But he\ndid not abuse his knowledge. The congregation thought a great deal of\nhim. Old, lame, blind to everything, probably a little deaf into the\nbargain,--what qualities! They would have found it difficult to replace\nhim.\n\nThe goodman, with the assurance of a person who feels that he is\nappreciated, entered into a rather diffuse and very deep rustic harangue\nto the reverend prioress. He talked a long time about his age, his\ninfirmities, the surcharge of years counting double for him henceforth,\nof the increasing demands of his work, of the great size of the garden,\nof nights which must be passed, like the last, for instance, when he had\nbeen obliged to put straw mats over the melon beds, because of the moon,\nand he wound up as follows: \"That he had a brother\"--(the prioress made\na movement),--\"a brother no longer young\"--(a second movement on the\npart of the prioress, but one expressive of reassurance),--\"that, if he\nmight be permitted, this brother would come and live with him and help\nhim, that he was an excellent gardener, that the community would receive\nfrom him good service, better than his own; that, otherwise, if his\nbrother were not admitted, as he, the elder, felt that his health was\nbroken and that he was insufficient for the work, he should be obliged,\ngreatly to his regret, to go away; and that his brother had a little\ndaughter whom he would bring with him, who might be reared for God in\nthe house, and who might, who knows, become a nun some day.\"\n\nWhen he had finished speaking, the prioress stayed the slipping of her\nrosary between her fingers, and said to him:--\n\n\"Could you procure a stout iron bar between now and this evening?\"\n\n\"For what purpose?\"\n\n\"To serve as a lever.\"\n\n\"Yes, reverend Mother,\" replied Fauchelevent.\n\nThe prioress, without adding a word, rose and entered the adjoining\nroom, which was the hall of the chapter, and where the vocal mothers\nwere probably assembled. Fauchelevent was left alone.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III--MOTHER INNOCENTE\n\nAbout a quarter of an hour elapsed. The prioress returned and seated\nherself once more on her chair.\n\nThe two interlocutors seemed preoccupied. We will present a stenographic\nreport of the dialogue which then ensued, to the best of our ability.\n\n\"Father Fauvent!\"\n\n\"Reverend Mother!\"\n\n\"Do you know the chapel?\"\n\n\"I have a little cage there, where I hear the mass and the offices.\"\n\n\"And you have been in the choir in pursuance of your duties?\"\n\n\"Two or three times.\"\n\n\"There is a stone to be raised.\"\n\n\"Heavy?\"\n\n\"The slab of the pavement which is at the side of the altar.\"\n\n\"The slab which closes the vault?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"It would be a good thing to have two men for it.\"\n\n\"Mother Ascension, who is as strong as a man, will help you.\"\n\n\"A woman is never a man.\"\n\n\"We have only a woman here to help you. Each one does what he can.\nBecause Dom Mabillon gives four hundred and seventeen epistles of\nSaint Bernard, while Merlonus Horstius only gives three hundred and\nsixty-seven, I do not despise Merlonus Horstius.\"\n\n\"Neither do I.\"\n\n\"Merit consists in working according to one's strength. A cloister is\nnot a dock-yard.\"\n\n\"And a woman is not a man. But my brother is the strong one, though!\"\n\n\"And can you get a lever?\"\n\n\"That is the only sort of key that fits that sort of door.\"\n\n\"There is a ring in the stone.\"\n\n\"I will put the lever through it.\"\n\n\"And the stone is so arranged that it swings on a pivot.\"\n\n\"That is good, reverend Mother. I will open the vault.\"\n\n\"And the four Mother Precentors will help you.\"\n\n\"And when the vault is open?\"\n\n\"It must be closed again.\"\n\n\"Will that be all?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Give me your orders, very reverend Mother.\"\n\n\"Fauvent, we have confidence in you.\"\n\n\"I am here to do anything you wish.\"\n\n\"And to hold your peace about everything!\"\n\n\"Yes, reverend Mother.\"\n\n\"When the vault is open--\"\n\n\"I will close it again.\"\n\n\"But before that--\"\n\n\"What, reverend Mother?\"\n\n\"Something must be lowered into it.\"\n\nA silence ensued. The prioress, after a pout of the under lip which\nresembled hesitation, broke it.\n\n\"Father Fauvent!\"\n\n\"Reverend Mother!\"\n\n\"You know that a mother died this morning?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Did you not hear the bell?\"\n\n\"Nothing can be heard at the bottom of the garden.\"\n\n\"Really?\"\n\n\"I can hardly distinguish my own signal.\"\n\n\"She died at daybreak.\"\n\n\"And then, the wind is not blowing in my direction this morning.\"\n\n\"It was Mother Crucifixion. A blessed woman.\"\n\nThe prioress paused, moved her lips, as though in mental prayer, and\nresumed:--\n\n\"Three years ago, Madame de Bethune, a Jansenist, turned orthodox,\nmerely from having seen Mother Crucifixion at prayer.\"\n\n\"Ah! yes, now I hear the knell, reverend Mother.\"\n\n\"The mothers have taken her to the dead-room, which opens on the\nchurch.\"\n\n\"I know.\"\n\n\"No other man than you can or must enter that chamber. See to that. A\nfine sight it would be, to see a man enter the dead-room!\"\n\n\"More often!\"\n\n\"Hey?\"\n\n\"More often!\"\n\n\"What do you say?\"\n\n\"I say more often.\"\n\n\"More often than what?\"\n\n\"Reverend Mother, I did not say more often than what, I said more\noften.\"\n\n\"I don't understand you. Why do you say more often?\"\n\n\"In order to speak like you, reverend Mother.\"\n\n\"But I did not say 'more often.'\"\n\nAt that moment, nine o'clock struck.\n\n\"At nine o'clock in the morning and at all hours, praised and adored be\nthe most Holy Sacrament of the altar,\" said the prioress.\n\n\"Amen,\" said Fauchelevent.\n\nThe clock struck opportunely. It cut \"more often\" short. It is probable,\nthat had it not been for this, the prioress and Fauchelevent would never\nhave unravelled that skein.\n\nFauchelevent mopped his forehead.\n\nThe prioress indulged in another little inward murmur, probably sacred,\nthen raised her voice:--\n\n\"In her lifetime, Mother Crucifixion made converts; after her death, she\nwill perform miracles.\"\n\n\"She will!\" replied Father Fauchelevent, falling into step, and striving\nnot to flinch again.\n\n\"Father Fauvent, the community has been blessed in Mother Crucifixion.\nNo doubt, it is not granted to every one to die, like Cardinal de\nBerulle, while saying the holy mass, and to breathe forth their souls to\nGod, while pronouncing these words: Hanc igitur oblationem. But without\nattaining to such happiness, Mother Crucifixion's death was very\nprecious. She retained her consciousness to the very last moment.\nShe spoke to us, then she spoke to the angels. She gave us her last\ncommands. If you had a little more faith, and if you could have been\nin her cell, she would have cured your leg merely by touching it.\nShe smiled. We felt that she was regaining her life in God. There was\nsomething of paradise in that death.\"\n\nFauchelevent thought that it was an orison which she was finishing.\n\n\"Amen,\" said he.\n\n\"Father Fauvent, what the dead wish must be done.\"\n\nThe prioress took off several beads of her chaplet. Fauchelevent held\nhis peace.\n\nShe went on:--\n\n\"I have consulted upon this point many ecclesiastics laboring in Our\nLord, who occupy themselves in the exercises of the clerical life, and\nwho bear wonderful fruit.\"\n\n\"Reverend Mother, you can hear the knell much better here than in the\ngarden.\"\n\n\"Besides, she is more than a dead woman, she is a saint.\"\n\n\"Like yourself, reverend Mother.\"\n\n\"She slept in her coffin for twenty years, by express permission of our\nHoly Father, Pius VII.--\"\n\n\"The one who crowned the Emp--Buonaparte.\"\n\nFor a clever man like Fauchelevent, this allusion was an awkward one.\nFortunately, the prioress, completely absorbed in her own thoughts, did\nnot hear it. She continued:--\n\n\"Father Fauvent?\"\n\n\"Reverend Mother?\"\n\n\"Saint Didorus, Archbishop of Cappadocia, desired that this single word\nmight be inscribed on his tomb: Acarus, which signifies, a worm of the\nearth; this was done. Is this true?\"\n\n\"Yes, reverend Mother.\"\n\n\"The blessed Mezzocane, Abbot of Aquila, wished to be buried beneath the\ngallows; this was done.\"\n\n\"That is true.\"\n\n\"Saint Terentius, Bishop of Port, where the mouth of the Tiber empties\ninto the sea, requested that on his tomb might be engraved the\nsign which was placed on the graves of parricides, in the hope that\npassers-by would spit on his tomb. This was done. The dead must be\nobeyed.\"\n\n\"So be it.\"\n\n\"The body of Bernard Guidonis, born in France near Roche-Abeille, was,\nas he had ordered, and in spite of the king of Castile, borne to the\nchurch of the Dominicans in Limoges, although Bernard Guidonis was\nBishop of Tuy in Spain. Can the contrary be affirmed?\"\n\n\"For that matter, no, reverend Mother.\"\n\n\"The fact is attested by Plantavit de la Fosse.\"\n\nSeveral beads of the chaplet were told off, still in silence. The\nprioress resumed:--\n\n\"Father Fauvent, Mother Crucifixion will be interred in the coffin in\nwhich she has slept for the last twenty years.\"\n\n\"That is just.\"\n\n\"It is a continuation of her slumber.\"\n\n\"So I shall have to nail up that coffin?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"And we are to reject the undertaker's coffin?\"\n\n\"Precisely.\"\n\n\"I am at the orders of the very reverend community.\"\n\n\"The four Mother Precentors will assist you.\"\n\n\"In nailing up the coffin? I do not need them.\"\n\n\"No. In lowering the coffin.\"\n\n\"Where?\"\n\n\"Into the vault.\"\n\n\"What vault?\"\n\n\"Under the altar.\"\n\nFauchelevent started.\n\n\"The vault under the altar?\"\n\n\"Under the altar.\"\n\n\"But--\"\n\n\"You will have an iron bar.\"\n\n\"Yes, but--\"\n\n\"You will raise the stone with the bar by means of the ring.\"\n\n\"But--\"\n\n\"The dead must be obeyed. To be buried in the vault under the altar of\nthe chapel, not to go to profane earth; to remain there in death where\nshe prayed while living; such was the last wish of Mother Crucifixion.\nShe asked it of us; that is to say, commanded us.\"\n\n\"But it is forbidden.\"\n\n\"Forbidden by men, enjoined by God.\"\n\n\"What if it became known?\"\n\n\"We have confidence in you.\"\n\n\"Oh! I am a stone in your walls.\"\n\n\"The chapter assembled. The vocal mothers, whom I have just consulted\nagain, and who are now deliberating, have decided that Mother\nCrucifixion shall be buried, according to her wish, in her own coffin,\nunder our altar. Think, Father Fauvent, if she were to work miracles\nhere! What a glory of God for the community! And miracles issue from\ntombs.\"\n\n\"But, reverend Mother, if the agent of the sanitary commission--\"\n\n\"Saint Benoit II., in the matter of sepulture, resisted Constantine\nPogonatus.\"\n\n\"But the commissary of police--\"\n\n\"Chonodemaire, one of the seven German kings who entered among the Gauls\nunder the Empire of Constantius, expressly recognized the right of nuns\nto be buried in religion, that is to say, beneath the altar.\"\n\n\"But the inspector from the Prefecture--\"\n\n\"The world is nothing in the presence of the cross. Martin, the eleventh\ngeneral of the Carthusians, gave to his order this device: Stat crux dum\nvolvitur orbis.\"\n\n\"Amen,\" said Fauchelevent, who imperturbably extricated himself in this\nmanner from the dilemma, whenever he heard Latin.\n\nAny audience suffices for a person who has held his peace too long. On\nthe day when the rhetorician Gymnastoras left his prison, bearing in\nhis body many dilemmas and numerous syllogisms which had struck in, he\nhalted in front of the first tree which he came to, harangued it and\nmade very great efforts to convince it. The prioress, who was usually\nsubjected to the barrier of silence, and whose reservoir was overfull,\nrose and exclaimed with the loquacity of a dam which has broken away:--\n\n\"I have on my right Benoit and on my left Bernard. Who was Bernard? The\nfirst abbot of Clairvaux. Fontaines in Burgundy is a country that is\nblest because it gave him birth. His father was named Tecelin, and his\nmother Alethe. He began at Citeaux, to end in Clairvaux; he was ordained\nabbot by the bishop of Chalon-sur-Saone, Guillaume de Champeaux; he had\nseven hundred novices, and founded a hundred and sixty monasteries; he\noverthrew Abeilard at the council of Sens in 1140, and Pierre de Bruys\nand Henry his disciple, and another sort of erring spirits who were\ncalled the Apostolics; he confounded Arnauld de Brescia, darted\nlightning at the monk Raoul, the murderer of the Jews, dominated the\ncouncil of Reims in 1148, caused the condemnation of Gilbert de Porea,\nBishop of Poitiers, caused the condemnation of Eon de l'Etoile, arranged\nthe disputes of princes, enlightened King Louis the Young, advised Pope\nEugene III., regulated the Temple, preached the crusade, performed\ntwo hundred and fifty miracles during his lifetime, and as many\nas thirty-nine in one day. Who was Benoit? He was the patriarch of\nMont-Cassin; he was the second founder of the Saintete Claustrale,\nhe was the Basil of the West. His order has produced forty popes, two\nhundred cardinals, fifty patriarchs, sixteen hundred archbishops, four\nthousand six hundred bishops, four emperors, twelve empresses, forty-six\nkings, forty-one queens, three thousand six hundred canonized saints,\nand has been in existence for fourteen hundred years. On one side Saint\nBernard, on the other the agent of the sanitary department! On one side\nSaint Benoit, on the other the inspector of public ways! The state,\nthe road commissioners, the public undertaker, regulations, the\nadministration, what do we know of all that? There is not a chance\npasser-by who would not be indignant to see how we are treated. We\nhave not even the right to give our dust to Jesus Christ! Your sanitary\ndepartment is a revolutionary invention. God subordinated to the\ncommissary of police; such is the age. Silence, Fauvent!\"\n\nFauchelevent was but ill at ease under this shower bath. The prioress\ncontinued:--\n\n\"No one doubts the right of the monastery to sepulture. Only fanatics\nand those in error deny it. We live in times of terrible confusion. We\ndo not know that which it is necessary to know, and we know that which\nwe should ignore. We are ignorant and impious. In this age there exist\npeople who do not distinguish between the very great Saint Bernard and\nthe Saint Bernard denominated of the poor Catholics, a certain good\necclesiastic who lived in the thirteenth century. Others are so\nblasphemous as to compare the scaffold of Louis XVI. to the cross of\nJesus Christ. Louis XVI. was merely a king. Let us beware of God! There\nis no longer just nor unjust. The name of Voltaire is known, but not\nthe name of Cesar de Bus. Nevertheless, Cesar de Bus is a man of blessed\nmemory, and Voltaire one of unblessed memory. The last arch-bishop,\nthe Cardinal de Perigord, did not even know that Charles de\nGondren succeeded to Berulle, and Francois Bourgoin to Gondren,\nand Jean-Francois Senault to Bourgoin, and Father Sainte-Marthe to\nJean-Francois Senault. The name of Father Coton is known, not because\nhe was one of the three who urged the foundation of the Oratorie, but\nbecause he furnished Henri IV., the Huguenot king, with the material\nfor an oath. That which pleases people of the world in Saint Francois de\nSales, is that he cheated at play. And then, religion is attacked. Why?\nBecause there have been bad priests, because Sagittaire, Bishop of Gap,\nwas the brother of Salone, Bishop of Embrun, and because both of them\nfollowed Mommol. What has that to do with the question? Does that\nprevent Martin de Tours from being a saint, and giving half of his cloak\nto a beggar? They persecute the saints. They shut their eyes to the\ntruth. Darkness is the rule. The most ferocious beasts are beasts which\nare blind. No one thinks of hell as a reality. Oh! how wicked people\nare! By order of the king signifies to-day, by order of the revolution.\nOne no longer knows what is due to the living or to the dead. A holy\ndeath is prohibited. Burial is a civil matter. This is horrible. Saint\nLeo II. wrote two special letters, one to Pierre Notaire, the other to\nthe king of the Visigoths, for the purpose of combating and rejecting,\nin questions touching the dead, the authority of the exarch and the\nsupremacy of the Emperor. Gauthier, Bishop of Chalons, held his own\nin this matter against Otho, Duke of Burgundy. The ancient magistracy\nagreed with him. In former times we had voices in the chapter, even on\nmatters of the day. The Abbot of Citeaux, the general of the order, was\ncouncillor by right of birth to the parliament of Burgundy. We do what\nwe please with our dead. Is not the body of Saint Benoit himself in\nFrance, in the abbey of Fleury, called Saint Benoit-sur-Loire, although\nhe died in Italy at Mont-Cassin, on Saturday, the 21st of the month\nof March, of the year 543? All this is incontestable. I abhor\npsalm-singers, I hate priors, I execrate heretics, but I should detest\nyet more any one who should maintain the contrary. One has only to\nread Arnoul Wion, Gabriel Bucelin, Trithemus, Maurolics, and Dom Luc\nd'Achery.\"\n\nThe prioress took breath, then turned to Fauchelevent.\n\n\"Is it settled, Father Fauvent?\"\n\n\"It is settled, reverend Mother.\"\n\n\"We may depend on you?\"\n\n\"I will obey.\"\n\n\"That is well.\"\n\n\"I am entirely devoted to the convent.\"\n\n\"That is understood. You will close the coffin. The sisters will carry\nit to the chapel. The office for the dead will then be said. Then we\nshall return to the cloister. Between eleven o'clock and midnight, you\nwill come with your iron bar. All will be done in the most profound\nsecrecy. There will be in the chapel only the four Mother Precentors,\nMother Ascension and yourself.\"\n\n\"And the sister at the post?\"\n\n\"She will not turn round.\"\n\n\"But she will hear.\"\n\n\"She will not listen. Besides, what the cloister knows the world learns\nnot.\"\n\nA pause ensued. The prioress went on:--\n\n\"You will remove your bell. It is not necessary that the sister at the\npost should perceive your presence.\"\n\n\"Reverend Mother?\"\n\n\"What, Father Fauvent?\"\n\n\"Has the doctor for the dead paid his visit?\"\n\n\"He will pay it at four o'clock to-day. The peal which orders the\ndoctor for the dead to be summoned has already been rung. But you do not\nunderstand any of the peals?\"\n\n\"I pay no attention to any but my own.\"\n\n\"That is well, Father Fauvent.\"\n\n\"Reverend Mother, a lever at least six feet long will be required.\"\n\n\"Where will you obtain it?\"\n\n\"Where gratings are not lacking, iron bars are not lacking. I have my\nheap of old iron at the bottom of the garden.\"\n\n\"About three-quarters of an hour before midnight; do not forget.\"\n\n\"Reverend Mother?\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"If you were ever to have any other jobs of this sort, my brother is the\nstrong man for you. A perfect Turk!\"\n\n\"You will do it as speedily as possible.\"\n\n\"I cannot work very fast. I am infirm; that is why I require an\nassistant. I limp.\"\n\n\"To limp is no sin, and perhaps it is a blessing. The Emperor Henry II.,\nwho combated Antipope Gregory and re-established Benoit VIII., has two\nsurnames, the Saint and the Lame.\"\n\n\"Two surtouts are a good thing,\" murmured Fauchelevent, who really was a\nlittle hard of hearing.\n\n\"Now that I think of it, Father Fauvent, let us give a whole hour to it.\nThat is not too much. Be near the principal altar, with your iron bar,\nat eleven o'clock. The office begins at midnight. Everything must have\nbeen completed a good quarter of an hour before that.\"\n\n\"I will do anything to prove my zeal towards the community. These are my\norders. I am to nail up the coffin. At eleven o'clock exactly, I am to\nbe in the chapel. The Mother Precentors will be there. Mother Ascension\nwill be there. Two men would be better. However, never mind! I shall\nhave my lever. We will open the vault, we will lower the coffin, and\nwe will close the vault again. After which, there will be no trace\nof anything. The government will have no suspicion. Thus all has been\narranged, reverend Mother?\"\n\n\"No!\"\n\n\"What else remains?\"\n\n\"The empty coffin remains.\"\n\nThis produced a pause. Fauchelevent meditated. The prioress meditated.\n\n\"What is to be done with that coffin, Father Fauvent?\"\n\n\"It will be given to the earth.\"\n\n\"Empty?\"\n\nAnother silence. Fauchelevent made, with his left hand, that sort of a\ngesture which dismisses a troublesome subject.\n\n\"Reverend Mother, I am the one who is to nail up the coffin in the\nbasement of the church, and no one can enter there but myself, and I\nwill cover the coffin with the pall.\"\n\n\"Yes, but the bearers, when they place it in the hearse and lower it\ninto the grave, will be sure to feel that there is nothing in it.\"\n\n\"Ah! the de--!\" exclaimed Fauchelevent.\n\nThe prioress began to make the sign of the cross, and looked fixedly at\nthe gardener. The vil stuck fast in his throat.\n\nHe made haste to improvise an expedient to make her forget the oath.\n\n\"I will put earth in the coffin, reverend Mother. That will produce the\neffect of a corpse.\"\n\n\"You are right. Earth, that is the same thing as man. So you will manage\nthe empty coffin?\"\n\n\"I will make that my special business.\"\n\nThe prioress's face, up to that moment troubled and clouded, grew serene\nonce more. She made the sign of a superior dismissing an inferior to\nhim. Fauchelevent went towards the door. As he was on the point of\npassing out, the prioress raised her voice gently:--\n\n\"I am pleased with you, Father Fauvent; bring your brother to me\nto-morrow, after the burial, and tell him to fetch his daughter.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV--IN WHICH JEAN VALJEAN HAS QUITE THE AIR OF HAVING READ\nAUSTIN CASTILLEJO\n\nThe strides of a lame man are like the ogling glances of a one-eyed man;\nthey do not reach their goal very promptly. Moreover, Fauchelevent\nwas in a dilemma. He took nearly a quarter of an hour to return to his\ncottage in the garden. Cosette had waked up. Jean Valjean had placed her\nnear the fire. At the moment when Fauchelevent entered, Jean Valjean was\npointing out to her the vintner's basket on the wall, and saying to her,\n\"Listen attentively to me, my little Cosette. We must go away from this\nhouse, but we shall return to it, and we shall be very happy here. The\ngood man who lives here is going to carry you off on his back in that.\nYou will wait for me at a lady's house. I shall come to fetch you. Obey,\nand say nothing, above all things, unless you want Madame Thenardier to\nget you again!\"\n\nCosette nodded gravely.\n\nJean Valjean turned round at the noise made by Fauchelevent opening the\ndoor.\n\n\"Well?\"\n\n\"Everything is arranged, and nothing is,\" said Fauchelevent. \"I have\npermission to bring you in; but before bringing you in you must be\ngot out. That's where the difficulty lies. It is easy enough with the\nchild.\"\n\n\"You will carry her out?\"\n\n\"And she will hold her tongue?\"\n\n\"I answer for that.\"\n\n\"But you, Father Madeleine?\"\n\nAnd, after a silence, fraught with anxiety, Fauchelevent exclaimed:--\n\n\"Why, get out as you came in!\"\n\nJean Valjean, as in the first instance, contented himself with saying,\n\"Impossible.\"\n\nFauchelevent grumbled, more to himself than to Jean Valjean:--\n\n\"There is another thing which bothers me. I have said that I would put\nearth in it. When I come to think it over, the earth instead of the\ncorpse will not seem like the real thing, it won't do, it will get\ndisplaced, it will move about. The men will bear it. You understand,\nFather Madeleine, the government will notice it.\"\n\nJean Valjean stared him straight in the eye and thought that he was\nraving.\n\nFauchelevent went on:--\n\n\"How the de--uce are you going to get out? It must all be done by\nto-morrow morning. It is to-morrow that I am to bring you in. The\nprioress expects you.\"\n\nThen he explained to Jean Valjean that this was his recompense for a\nservice which he, Fauchelevent, was to render to the community. That it\nfell among his duties to take part in their burials, that he nailed up\nthe coffins and helped the grave-digger at the cemetery. That the nun\nwho had died that morning had requested to be buried in the coffin which\nhad served her for a bed, and interred in the vault under the altar of\nthe chapel. That the police regulations forbade this, but that she was\none of those dead to whom nothing is refused. That the prioress and the\nvocal mothers intended to fulfil the wish of the deceased. That it was\nso much the worse for the government. That he, Fauchelevent, was to nail\nup the coffin in the cell, raise the stone in the chapel, and lower the\ncorpse into the vault. And that, by way of thanks, the prioress was to\nadmit his brother to the house as a gardener, and his niece as a pupil.\nThat his brother was M. Madeleine, and that his niece was Cosette. That\nthe prioress had told him to bring his brother on the following evening,\nafter the counterfeit interment in the cemetery. But that he could not\nbring M. Madeleine in from the outside if M. Madeleine was not outside.\nThat that was the first problem. And then, that there was another: the\nempty coffin.\n\n\"What is that empty coffin?\" asked Jean Valjean.\n\nFauchelevent replied:--\n\n\"The coffin of the administration.\"\n\n\"What coffin? What administration?\"\n\n\"A nun dies. The municipal doctor comes and says, 'A nun has died.'\nThe government sends a coffin. The next day it sends a hearse and\nundertaker's men to get the coffin and carry it to the cemetery. The\nundertaker's men will come and lift the coffin; there will be nothing in\nit.\"\n\n\"Put something in it.\"\n\n\"A corpse? I have none.\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"What then?\"\n\n\"A living person.\"\n\n\"What person?\"\n\n\"Me!\" said Jean Valjean.\n\nFauchelevent, who was seated, sprang up as though a bomb had burst under\nhis chair.\n\n\"You!\"\n\n\"Why not?\"\n\nJean Valjean gave way to one of those rare smiles which lighted up his\nface like a flash from heaven in the winter.\n\n\"You know, Fauchelevent, what you have said: 'Mother Crucifixion is\ndead.' and I add: 'and Father Madeleine is buried.'\"\n\n\"Ah! good, you can laugh, you are not speaking seriously.\"\n\n\"Very seriously, I must get out of this place.\"\n\n\"Certainly.\"\n\n\"l have told you to find a basket, and a cover for me also.\"\n\n\"Well?\"\n\n\"The basket will be of pine, and the cover a black cloth.\"\n\n\"In the first place, it will be a white cloth. Nuns are buried in\nwhite.\"\n\n\"Let it be a white cloth, then.\"\n\n\"You are not like other men, Father Madeleine.\"\n\nTo behold such devices, which are nothing else than the savage and\ndaring inventions of the galleys, spring forth from the peaceable things\nwhich surrounded him, and mingle with what he called the \"petty course\nof life in the convent,\" caused Fauchelevent as much amazement as a\ngull fishing in the gutter of the Rue Saint-Denis would inspire in a\npasser-by.\n\nJean Valjean went on:--\n\n\"The problem is to get out of here without being seen. This offers\nthe means. But give me some information, in the first place. How is it\nmanaged? Where is this coffin?\"\n\n\"The empty one?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Down stairs, in what is called the dead-room. It stands on two\ntrestles, under the pall.\"\n\n\"How long is the coffin?\"\n\n\"Six feet.\"\n\n\"What is this dead-room?\"\n\n\"It is a chamber on the ground floor which has a grated window opening\non the garden, which is closed on the outside by a shutter, and two\ndoors; one leads into the convent, the other into the church.\"\n\n\"What church?\"\n\n\"The church in the street, the church which any one can enter.\"\n\n\"Have you the keys to those two doors?\"\n\n\"No; I have the key to the door which communicates with the convent; the\nporter has the key to the door which communicates with the church.\"\n\n\"When does the porter open that door?\"\n\n\"Only to allow the undertaker's men to enter, when they come to get the\ncoffin. When the coffin has been taken out, the door is closed again.\"\n\n\"Who nails up the coffin?\"\n\n\"I do.\"\n\n\"Who spreads the pall over it?\"\n\n\"I do.\"\n\n\"Are you alone?\"\n\n\"Not another man, except the police doctor, can enter the dead-room.\nThat is even written on the wall.\"\n\n\"Could you hide me in that room to-night when every one is asleep?\"\n\n\"No. But I could hide you in a small, dark nook which opens on the\ndead-room, where I keep my tools to use for burials, and of which I have\nthe key.\"\n\n\"At what time will the hearse come for the coffin to-morrow?\"\n\n\"About three o'clock in the afternoon. The burial will take place at the\nVaugirard cemetery a little before nightfall. It is not very near.\"\n\n\"I will remain concealed in your tool-closet all night and all the\nmorning. And how about food? I shall be hungry.\"\n\n\"I will bring you something.\"\n\n\"You can come and nail me up in the coffin at two o'clock.\"\n\nFauchelevent recoiled and cracked his finger-joints.\n\n\"But that is impossible!\"\n\n\"Bah! Impossible to take a hammer and drive some nails in a plank?\"\n\nWhat seemed unprecedented to Fauchelevent was, we repeat, a simple\nmatter to Jean Valjean. Jean Valjean had been in worse straits than\nthis. Any man who has been a prisoner understands how to contract\nhimself to fit the diameter of the escape. The prisoner is subject to\nflight as the sick man is subject to a crisis which saves or kills him.\nAn escape is a cure. What does not a man undergo for the sake of a\ncure? To have himself nailed up in a case and carried off like a bale\nof goods, to live for a long time in a box, to find air where there is\nnone, to economize his breath for hours, to know how to stifle without\ndying--this was one of Jean Valjean's gloomy talents.\n\nMoreover, a coffin containing a living being,--that convict's\nexpedient,--is also an imperial expedient. If we are to credit the monk\nAustin Castillejo, this was the means employed by Charles the Fifth,\ndesirous of seeing the Plombes for the last time after his abdication.\n\nHe had her brought into and carried out of the monastery of Saint-Yuste\nin this manner.\n\nFauchelevent, who had recovered himself a little, exclaimed:--\n\n\"But how will you manage to breathe?\"\n\n\"I will breathe.\"\n\n\"In that box! The mere thought of it suffocates me.\"\n\n\"You surely must have a gimlet, you will make a few holes here and\nthere, around my mouth, and you will nail the top plank on loosely.\"\n\n\"Good! And what if you should happen to cough or to sneeze?\"\n\n\"A man who is making his escape does not cough or sneeze.\"\n\nAnd Jean Valjean added:--\n\n\"Father Fauchelevent, we must come to a decision: I must either be\ncaught here, or accept this escape through the hearse.\"\n\nEvery one has noticed the taste which cats have for pausing and lounging\nbetween the two leaves of a half-shut door. Who is there who has not\nsaid to a cat, \"Do come in!\" There are men who, when an incident stands\nhalf-open before them, have the same tendency to halt in indecision\nbetween two resolutions, at the risk of getting crushed through the\nabrupt closing of the adventure by fate. The over-prudent, cats as they\nare, and because they are cats, sometimes incur more danger than\nthe audacious. Fauchelevent was of this hesitating nature. But\nJean Valjean's coolness prevailed over him in spite of himself. He\ngrumbled:--\n\n\"Well, since there is no other means.\"\n\nJean Valjean resumed:--\n\n\"The only thing which troubles me is what will take place at the\ncemetery.\"\n\n\"That is the very point that is not troublesome,\" exclaimed\nFauchelevent. \"If you are sure of coming out of the coffin all right, I\nam sure of getting you out of the grave. The grave-digger is a drunkard,\nand a friend of mine. He is Father Mestienne. An old fellow of the old\nschool. The grave-digger puts the corpses in the grave, and I put the\ngrave-digger in my pocket. I will tell you what will take place. They\nwill arrive a little before dusk, three-quarters of an hour before the\ngates of the cemetery are closed. The hearse will drive directly up to\nthe grave. I shall follow; that is my business. I shall have a hammer,\na chisel, and some pincers in my pocket. The hearse halts, the\nundertaker's men knot a rope around your coffin and lower you down. The\npriest says the prayers, makes the sign of the cross, sprinkles the holy\nwater, and takes his departure. I am left alone with Father Mestienne.\nHe is my friend, I tell you. One of two things will happen, he will\neither be sober, or he will not be sober. If he is not drunk, I shall\nsay to him: 'Come and drink a bout while the Bon Coing [the Good Quince]\nis open.' I carry him off, I get him drunk,--it does not take long to\nmake Father Mestienne drunk, he always has the beginning of it about\nhim,--I lay him under the table, I take his card, so that I can get into\nthe cemetery again, and I return without him. Then you have no longer\nany one but me to deal with. If he is drunk, I shall say to him: 'Be\noff; I will do your work for you.' Off he goes, and I drag you out of\nthe hole.\"\n\nJean Valjean held out his hand, and Fauchelevent precipitated himself\nupon it with the touching effusion of a peasant.\n\n\"That is settled, Father Fauchelevent. All will go well.\"\n\n\"Provided nothing goes wrong,\" thought Fauchelevent. \"In that case, it\nwould be terrible.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V--IT IS NOT NECESSARY TO BE DRUNK IN ORDER TO BE IMMORTAL\n\nOn the following day, as the sun was declining, the very rare passers-by\non the Boulevard du Maine pulled off their hats to an old-fashioned\nhearse, ornamented with skulls, cross-bones, and tears. This hearse\ncontained a coffin covered with a white cloth over which spread a large\nblack cross, like a huge corpse with drooping arms. A mourning-coach, in\nwhich could be seen a priest in his surplice, and a choir boy in his red\ncap, followed. Two undertaker's men in gray uniforms trimmed with black\nwalked on the right and the left of the hearse. Behind it came an old\nman in the garments of a laborer, who limped along. The procession was\ngoing in the direction of the Vaugirard cemetery.\n\nThe handle of a hammer, the blade of a cold chisel, and the antennae of\na pair of pincers were visible, protruding from the man's pocket.\n\nThe Vaugirard cemetery formed an exception among the cemeteries of\nParis. It had its peculiar usages, just as it had its carriage\nentrance and its house door, which old people in the quarter, who clung\ntenaciously to ancient words, still called the porte cavaliere and the\nporte pietonne.[16] The Bernardines-Benedictines of the Rue Petit-Picpus\nhad obtained permission, as we have already stated, to be buried there\nin a corner apart, and at night, the plot of land having formerly\nbelonged to their community. The grave-diggers being thus bound to\nservice in the evening in summer and at night in winter, in this\ncemetery, they were subjected to a special discipline. The gates of the\nParis cemeteries closed, at that epoch, at sundown, and this being a\nmunicipal regulation, the Vaugirard cemetery was bound by it like the\nrest. The carriage gate and the house door were two contiguous grated\ngates, adjoining a pavilion built by the architect Perronet, and\ninhabited by the door-keeper of the cemetery. These gates, therefore,\nswung inexorably on their hinges at the instant when the sun disappeared\nbehind the dome of the Invalides. If any grave-digger were delayed\nafter that moment in the cemetery, there was but one way for him to\nget out--his grave-digger's card furnished by the department of public\nfunerals. A sort of letter-box was constructed in the porter's window.\nThe grave-digger dropped his card into this box, the porter heard it\nfall, pulled the rope, and the small door opened. If the man had not his\ncard, he mentioned his name, the porter, who was sometimes in bed and\nasleep, rose, came out and identified the man, and opened the gate with\nhis key; the grave-digger stepped out, but had to pay a fine of fifteen\nfrancs.\n\nThis cemetery, with its peculiarities outside the regulations,\nembarrassed the symmetry of the administration. It was suppressed\na little later than 1830. The cemetery of Mont-Parnasse, called the\nEastern cemetery, succeeded to it, and inherited that famous dram-shop\nnext to the Vaugirard cemetery, which was surmounted by a quince painted\non a board, and which formed an angle, one side on the drinkers' tables,\nand the other on the tombs, with this sign: Au Bon Coing.\n\nThe Vaugirard cemetery was what may be called a faded cemetery. It\nwas falling into disuse. Dampness was invading it, the flowers were\ndeserting it. The bourgeois did not care much about being buried in\nthe Vaugirard; it hinted at poverty. Pere-Lachaise if you please! to be\nburied in Pere-Lachaise is equivalent to having furniture of mahogany.\nIt is recognized as elegant. The Vaugirard cemetery was a venerable\nenclosure, planted like an old-fashioned French garden. Straight alleys,\nbox, thuya-trees, holly, ancient tombs beneath aged cypress-trees, and\nvery tall grass. In the evening it was tragic there. There were very\nlugubrious lines about it.\n\nThe sun had not yet set when the hearse with the white pall and the\nblack cross entered the avenue of the Vaugirard cemetery. The lame man\nwho followed it was no other than Fauchelevent.\n\nThe interment of Mother Crucifixion in the vault under the altar, the\nexit of Cosette, the introduction of Jean Valjean to the dead-room,--all\nhad been executed without difficulty, and there had been no hitch.\n\nLet us remark in passing, that the burial of Mother Crucifixion under\nthe altar of the convent is a perfectly venial offence in our sight. It\nis one of the faults which resemble a duty. The nuns had committed it,\nnot only without difficulty, but even with the applause of their own\nconsciences. In the cloister, what is called the \"government\" is only\nan intermeddling with authority, an interference which is always\nquestionable. In the first place, the rule; as for the code, we shall\nsee. Make as many laws as you please, men; but keep them for yourselves.\nThe tribute to Caesar is never anything but the remnants of the tribute\nto God. A prince is nothing in the presence of a principle.\n\nFauchelevent limped along behind the hearse in a very contented frame\nof mind. His twin plots, the one with the nuns, the one for the convent,\nthe other against it, the other with M. Madeleine, had succeeded, to\nall appearance. Jean Valjean's composure was one of those powerful\ntranquillities which are contagious. Fauchelevent no longer felt\ndoubtful as to his success.\n\nWhat remained to be done was a mere nothing. Within the last two years,\nhe had made good Father Mestienne, a chubby-cheeked person, drunk at\nleast ten times. He played with Father Mestienne. He did what he liked\nwith him. He made him dance according to his whim. Mestienne's head\nadjusted itself to the cap of Fauchelevent's will. Fauchelevent's\nconfidence was perfect.\n\nAt the moment when the convoy entered the avenue leading to the\ncemetery, Fauchelevent glanced cheerfully at the hearse, and said half\naloud, as he rubbed his big hands:--\n\n\"Here's a fine farce!\"\n\nAll at once the hearse halted; it had reached the gate. The permission\nfor interment must be exhibited. The undertaker's man addressed himself\nto the porter of the cemetery. During this colloquy, which always is\nproductive of a delay of from one to two minutes, some one, a stranger,\ncame and placed himself behind the hearse, beside Fauchelevent. He was\na sort of laboring man, who wore a waistcoat with large pockets and\ncarried a mattock under his arm.\n\nFauchelevent surveyed this stranger.\n\n\"Who are you?\" he demanded.\n\n\"The man replied:--\n\n\"The grave-digger.\"\n\nIf a man could survive the blow of a cannon-ball full in the breast, he\nwould make the same face that Fauchelevent made.\n\n\"The grave-digger?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"You?\"\n\n\"I.\"\n\n\"Father Mestienne is the grave-digger.\"\n\n\"He was.\"\n\n\"What! He was?\"\n\n\"He is dead.\"\n\nFauchelevent had expected anything but this, that a grave-digger could\ndie. It is true, nevertheless, that grave-diggers do die themselves. By\ndint of excavating graves for other people, one hollows out one's own.\n\nFauchelevent stood there with his mouth wide open. He had hardly the\nstrength to stammer:--\n\n\"But it is not possible!\"\n\n\"It is so.\"\n\n\"But,\" he persisted feebly, \"Father Mestienne is the grave-digger.\"\n\n\"After Napoleon, Louis XVIII. After Mestienne, Gribier. Peasant, my name\nis Gribier.\"\n\nFauchelevent, who was deadly pale, stared at this Gribier.\n\nHe was a tall, thin, livid, utterly funereal man. He had the air of an\nunsuccessful doctor who had turned grave-digger.\n\nFauchelevent burst out laughing.\n\n\"Ah!\" said he, \"what queer things do happen! Father Mestienne is dead,\nbut long live little Father Lenoir! Do you know who little Father Lenoir\nis? He is a jug of red wine. It is a jug of Surene, morbigou! of real\nParis Surene? Ah! So old Mestienne is dead! I am sorry for it; he was\na jolly fellow. But you are a jolly fellow, too. Are you not, comrade?\nWe'll go and have a drink together presently.\"\n\nThe man replied:--\n\n\"I have been a student. I passed my fourth examination. I never drink.\"\n\nThe hearse had set out again, and was rolling up the grand alley of the\ncemetery.\n\nFauchelevent had slackened his pace. He limped more out of anxiety than\nfrom infirmity.\n\nThe grave-digger walked on in front of him.\n\nFauchelevent passed the unexpected Gribier once more in review.\n\nHe was one of those men who, though very young, have the air of age, and\nwho, though slender, are extremely strong.\n\n\"Comrade!\" cried Fauchelevent.\n\nThe man turned round.\n\n\"I am the convent grave-digger.\"\n\n\"My colleague,\" said the man.\n\nFauchelevent, who was illiterate but very sharp, understood that he\nhad to deal with a formidable species of man, with a fine talker. He\nmuttered:\n\n\"So Father Mestienne is dead.\"\n\nThe man replied:--\n\n\"Completely. The good God consulted his note-book which shows when the\ntime is up. It was Father Mestienne's turn. Father Mestienne died.\"\n\nFauchelevent repeated mechanically: \"The good God--\"\n\n\"The good God,\" said the man authoritatively. \"According to the\nphilosophers, the Eternal Father; according to the Jacobins, the Supreme\nBeing.\"\n\n\"Shall we not make each other's acquaintance?\" stammered Fauchelevent.\n\n\"It is made. You are a peasant, I am a Parisian.\"\n\n\"People do not know each other until they have drunk together. He who\nempties his glass empties his heart. You must come and have a drink with\nme. Such a thing cannot be refused.\"\n\n\"Business first.\"\n\nFauchelevent thought: \"I am lost.\"\n\nThey were only a few turns of the wheel distant from the small alley\nleading to the nuns' corner.\n\nThe grave-digger resumed:--\n\n\"Peasant, I have seven small children who must be fed. As they must eat,\nI cannot drink.\"\n\nAnd he added, with the satisfaction of a serious man who is turning a\nphrase well:--\n\n\"Their hunger is the enemy of my thirst.\"\n\nThe hearse skirted a clump of cypress-trees, quitted the grand alley,\nturned into a narrow one, entered the waste land, and plunged into\na thicket. This indicated the immediate proximity of the place of\nsepulture. Fauchelevent slackened his pace, but he could not detain the\nhearse. Fortunately, the soil, which was light and wet with the winter\nrains, clogged the wheels and retarded its speed.\n\nHe approached the grave-digger.\n\n\"They have such a nice little Argenteuil wine,\" murmured Fauchelevent.\n\n\"Villager,\" retorted the man, \"I ought not be a grave-digger. My\nfather was a porter at the Prytaneum [Town-Hall]. He destined me for\nliterature. But he had reverses. He had losses on 'change. I was obliged\nto renounce the profession of author. But I am still a public writer.\"\n\n\"So you are not a grave-digger, then?\" returned Fauchelevent, clutching\nat this branch, feeble as it was.\n\n\"The one does not hinder the other. I cumulate.\"\n\nFauchelevent did not understand this last word.\n\n\"Come have a drink,\" said he.\n\nHere a remark becomes necessary. Fauchelevent, whatever his anguish,\noffered a drink, but he did not explain himself on one point; who was to\npay? Generally, Fauchelevent offered and Father Mestienne paid. An offer\nof a drink was the evident result of the novel situation created by the\nnew grave-digger, and it was necessary to make this offer, but the old\ngardener left the proverbial quarter of an hour named after Rabelais in\nthe dark, and that not unintentionally. As for himself, Fauchelevent did\nnot wish to pay, troubled as he was.\n\nThe grave-digger went on with a superior smile:--\n\n\"One must eat. I have accepted Father Mestienne's reversion. One gets to\nbe a philosopher when one has nearly completed his classes. To the labor\nof the hand I join the labor of the arm. I have my scrivener's stall in\nthe market of the Rue de Sevres. You know? the Umbrella Market. All the\ncooks of the Red Cross apply to me. I scribble their declarations of\nlove to the raw soldiers. In the morning I write love letters; in the\nevening I dig graves. Such is life, rustic.\"\n\nThe hearse was still advancing. Fauchelevent, uneasy to the last degree,\nwas gazing about him on all sides. Great drops of perspiration trickled\ndown from his brow.\n\n\"But,\" continued the grave-digger, \"a man cannot serve two mistresses.\nI must choose between the pen and the mattock. The mattock is ruining my\nhand.\"\n\nThe hearse halted.\n\nThe choir boy alighted from the mourning-coach, then the priest.\n\nOne of the small front wheels of the hearse had run up a little on a\npile of earth, beyond which an open grave was visible.\n\n\"What a farce this is!\" repeated Fauchelevent in consternation.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI--BETWEEN FOUR PLANKS\n\nWho was in the coffin? The reader knows. Jean Valjean.\n\nJean Valjean had arranged things so that he could exist there, and he\ncould almost breathe.\n\nIt is a strange thing to what a degree security of conscience confers\nsecurity of the rest. Every combination thought out by Jean Valjean had\nbeen progressing, and progressing favorably, since the preceding day.\nHe, like Fauchelevent, counted on Father Mestienne. He had no doubt\nas to the end. Never was there a more critical situation, never more\ncomplete composure.\n\nThe four planks of the coffin breathe out a kind of terrible peace. It\nseemed as though something of the repose of the dead entered into Jean\nValjean's tranquillity.\n\nFrom the depths of that coffin he had been able to follow, and he had\nfollowed, all the phases of the terrible drama which he was playing with\ndeath.\n\nShortly after Fauchelevent had finished nailing on the upper plank, Jean\nValjean had felt himself carried out, then driven off. He knew, from the\ndiminution in the jolting, when they left the pavements and reached the\nearth road. He had divined, from a dull noise, that they were crossing\nthe bridge of Austerlitz. At the first halt, he had understood that they\nwere entering the cemetery; at the second halt, he said to himself:--\n\n\"Here is the grave.\"\n\nSuddenly, he felt hands seize the coffin, then a harsh grating against\nthe planks; he explained it to himself as the rope which was being\nfastened round the casket in order to lower it into the cavity.\n\nThen he experienced a giddiness.\n\nThe undertaker's man and the grave-digger had probably allowed the\ncoffin to lose its balance, and had lowered the head before the foot. He\nrecovered himself fully when he felt himself horizontal and motionless.\nHe had just touched the bottom.\n\nHe had a certain sensation of cold.\n\nA voice rose above him, glacial and solemn. He heard Latin words, which\nhe did not understand, pass over him, so slowly that he was able to\ncatch them one by one:--\n\n\"Qui dormiunt in terrae pulvere, evigilabunt; alii in vitam aeternam, et\nalii in approbrium, ut videant semper.\"\n\nA child's voice said:--\n\n\"De profundis.\"\n\nThe grave voice began again:--\n\n\"Requiem aeternam dona ei, Domine.\"\n\nThe child's voice responded:--\n\n\"Et lux perpetua luceat ei.\"\n\nHe heard something like the gentle patter of several drops of rain on\nthe plank which covered him. It was probably the holy water.\n\nHe thought: \"This will be over soon now. Patience for a little while\nlonger. The priest will take his departure. Fauchelevent will take\nMestienne off to drink. I shall be left. Then Fauchelevent will return\nalone, and I shall get out. That will be the work of a good hour.\"\n\nThe grave voice resumed\n\n\"Requiescat in pace.\"\n\nAnd the child's voice said:--\n\n\"Amen.\"\n\nJean Valjean strained his ears, and heard something like retreating\nfootsteps.\n\n\"There, they are going now,\" thought he. \"I am alone.\"\n\nAll at once, he heard over his head a sound which seemed to him to be a\nclap of thunder.\n\nIt was a shovelful of earth falling on the coffin.\n\nA second shovelful fell.\n\nOne of the holes through which he breathed had just been stopped up.\n\nA third shovelful of earth fell.\n\nThen a fourth.\n\nThere are things which are too strong for the strongest man. Jean\nValjean lost consciousness.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII--IN WHICH WILL BE FOUND THE ORIGIN OF THE SAYING: DON'T LOSE\nTHE CARD\n\nThis is what had taken place above the coffin in which lay Jean Valjean.\n\nWhen the hearse had driven off, when the priest and the choir boy had\nentered the carriage again and taken their departure, Fauchelevent, who\nhad not taken his eyes from the grave-digger, saw the latter bend over\nand grasp his shovel, which was sticking upright in the heap of dirt.\n\nThen Fauchelevent took a supreme resolve.\n\nHe placed himself between the grave and the grave-digger, crossed his\narms and said:--\n\n\"I am the one to pay!\"\n\nThe grave-digger stared at him in amazement, and replied:--\n\n\"What's that, peasant?\"\n\nFauchelevent repeated:--\n\n\"I am the one who pays!\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"For the wine.\"\n\n\"What wine?\"\n\n\"That Argenteuil wine.\"\n\n\"Where is the Argenteuil?\"\n\n\"At the Bon Coing.\"\n\n\"Go to the devil!\" said the grave-digger.\n\nAnd he flung a shovelful of earth on the coffin.\n\nThe coffin gave back a hollow sound. Fauchelevent felt himself stagger\nand on the point of falling headlong into the grave himself. He shouted\nin a voice in which the strangling sound of the death rattle began to\nmingle:--\n\n\"Comrade! Before the Bon Coing is shut!\"\n\nThe grave-digger took some more earth on his shovel. Fauchelevent\ncontinued.\n\n\"I will pay.\"\n\nAnd he seized the man's arm.\n\n\"Listen to me, comrade. I am the convent grave-digger, I have come\nto help you. It is a business which can be performed at night. Let us\nbegin, then, by going for a drink.\"\n\nAnd as he spoke, and clung to this desperate insistence, this melancholy\nreflection occurred to him: \"And if he drinks, will he get drunk?\"\n\n\"Provincial,\" said the man, \"if you positively insist upon it, I\nconsent. We will drink. After work, never before.\"\n\nAnd he flourished his shovel briskly. Fauchelevent held him back.\n\n\"It is Argenteuil wine, at six.\"\n\n\"Oh, come,\" said the grave-digger, \"you are a bell-ringer. Ding dong,\nding dong, that's all you know how to say. Go hang yourself.\"\n\nAnd he threw in a second shovelful.\n\nFauchelevent had reached a point where he no longer knew what he was\nsaying.\n\n\"Come along and drink,\" he cried, \"since it is I who pays the bill.\"\n\n\"When we have put the child to bed,\" said the grave-digger.\n\nHe flung in a third shovelful.\n\nThen he thrust his shovel into the earth and added:--\n\n\"It's cold to-night, you see, and the corpse would shriek out after us\nif we were to plant her there without a coverlet.\"\n\nAt that moment, as he loaded his shovel, the grave-digger bent over,\nand the pocket of his waistcoat gaped. Fauchelevent's wild gaze fell\nmechanically into that pocket, and there it stopped.\n\nThe sun was not yet hidden behind the horizon; there was still light\nenough to enable him to distinguish something white at the bottom of\nthat yawning pocket.\n\nThe sum total of lightning that the eye of a Picard peasant can contain,\ntraversed Fauchelevent's pupils. An idea had just occurred to him.\n\nHe thrust his hand into the pocket from behind, without the\ngrave-digger, who was wholly absorbed in his shovelful of earth,\nobserving it, and pulled out the white object which lay at the bottom of\nit.\n\nThe man sent a fourth shovelful tumbling into the grave.\n\nJust as he turned round to get the fifth, Fauchelevent looked calmly at\nhim and said:--\n\n\"By the way, you new man, have you your card?\"\n\nThe grave-digger paused.\n\n\"What card?\"\n\n\"The sun is on the point of setting.\"\n\n\"That's good, it is going to put on its nightcap.\"\n\n\"The gate of the cemetery will close immediately.\"\n\n\"Well, what then?\"\n\n\"Have you your card?\"\n\n\"Ah! my card?\" said the grave-digger.\n\nAnd he fumbled in his pocket.\n\nHaving searched one pocket, he proceeded to search the other. He passed\non to his fobs, explored the first, returned to the second.\n\n\"Why, no,\" said he, \"I have not my card. I must have forgotten it.\"\n\n\"Fifteen francs fine,\" said Fauchelevent.\n\nThe grave-digger turned green. Green is the pallor of livid people.\n\n\"Ah! Jesus-mon-Dieu-bancroche-a-bas-la-lune!\"[17] he exclaimed. \"Fifteen\nfrancs fine!\"\n\n\"Three pieces of a hundred sous,\" said Fauchelevent.\n\nThe grave-digger dropped his shovel.\n\nFauchelevent's turn had come.\n\n\"Ah, come now, conscript,\" said Fauchelevent, \"none of this despair.\nThere is no question of committing suicide and benefiting the grave.\nFifteen francs is fifteen francs, and besides, you may not be able to\npay it. I am an old hand, you are a new one. I know all the ropes and\nthe devices. I will give you some friendly advice. One thing is clear,\nthe sun is on the point of setting, it is touching the dome now, the\ncemetery will be closed in five minutes more.\"\n\n\"That is true,\" replied the man.\n\n\"Five minutes more and you will not have time to fill the grave, it is\nas hollow as the devil, this grave, and to reach the gate in season to\npass it before it is shut.\"\n\n\"That is true.\"\n\n\"In that case, a fine of fifteen francs.\"\n\n\"Fifteen francs.\"\n\n\"But you have time. Where do you live?\"\n\n\"A couple of steps from the barrier, a quarter of an hour from here. No.\n87 Rue de Vaugirard.\"\n\n\"You have just time to get out by taking to your heels at your best\nspeed.\"\n\n\"That is exactly so.\"\n\n\"Once outside the gate, you gallop home, you get your card, you return,\nthe cemetery porter admits you. As you have your card, there will be\nnothing to pay. And you will bury your corpse. I'll watch it for you in\nthe meantime, so that it shall not run away.\"\n\n\"I am indebted to you for my life, peasant.\"\n\n\"Decamp!\" said Fauchelevent.\n\nThe grave-digger, overwhelmed with gratitude, shook his hand and set off\non a run.\n\nWhen the man had disappeared in the thicket, Fauchelevent listened until\nhe heard his footsteps die away in the distance, then he leaned over the\ngrave, and said in a low tone:--\n\n\"Father Madeleine!\"\n\nThere was no reply.\n\nFauchelevent was seized with a shudder. He tumbled rather than climbed\ninto the grave, flung himself on the head of the coffin and cried:--\n\n\"Are you there?\"\n\nSilence in the coffin.\n\nFauchelevent, hardly able to draw his breath for trembling, seized his\ncold chisel and his hammer, and pried up the coffin lid.\n\nJean Valjean's face appeared in the twilight; it was pale and his eyes\nwere closed.\n\nFauchelevent's hair rose upright on his head, he sprang to his feet,\nthen fell back against the side of the grave, ready to swoon on the\ncoffin. He stared at Jean Valjean.\n\nJean Valjean lay there pallid and motionless.\n\nFauchelevent murmured in a voice as faint as a sigh:--\n\n\"He is dead!\"\n\nAnd, drawing himself up, and folding his arms with such violence that\nhis clenched fists came in contact with his shoulders, he cried:--\n\n\"And this is the way I save his life!\"\n\nThen the poor man fell to sobbing. He soliloquized the while, for it is\nan error to suppose that the soliloquy is unnatural. Powerful emotion\noften talks aloud.\n\n\"It is Father Mestienne's fault. Why did that fool die? What need was\nthere for him to give up the ghost at the very moment when no one was\nexpecting it? It is he who has killed M. Madeleine. Father Madeleine!\nHe is in the coffin. It is quite handy. All is over. Now, is there any\nsense in these things? Ah! my God! he is dead! Well! and his little\ngirl, what am I to do with her? What will the fruit-seller say? The idea\nof its being possible for a man like that to die like this! When I think\nhow he put himself under that cart! Father Madeleine! Father Madeleine!\nPardine! He was suffocated, I said so. He wouldn't believe me. Well!\nHere's a pretty trick to play! He is dead, that good man, the very best\nman out of all the good God's good folks! And his little girl! Ah! In\nthe first place, I won't go back there myself. I shall stay here. After\nhaving done such a thing as that! What's the use of being two old men,\nif we are two old fools! But, in the first place, how did he manage to\nenter the convent? That was the beginning of it all. One should not\ndo such things. Father Madeleine! Father Madeleine! Father Madeleine!\nMadeleine! Monsieur Madeleine! Monsieur le Maire! He does not hear me.\nNow get out of this scrape if you can!\"\n\nAnd he tore his hair.\n\nA grating sound became audible through the trees in the distance. It was\nthe cemetery gate closing.\n\nFauchelevent bent over Jean Valjean, and all at once he bounded back and\nrecoiled so far as the limits of a grave permit.\n\nJean Valjean's eyes were open and gazing at him.\n\nTo see a corpse is alarming, to behold a resurrection is almost as much\nso. Fauchelevent became like stone, pale, haggard, overwhelmed by all\nthese excesses of emotion, not knowing whether he had to do with a\nliving man or a dead one, and staring at Jean Valjean, who was gazing at\nhim.\n\n[Illustration: The Resurrection 2b8-7-resurrection]\n\n\"I fell asleep,\" said Jean Valjean.\n\nAnd he raised himself to a sitting posture.\n\nFauchelevent fell on his knees.\n\n\"Just, good Virgin! How you frightened me!\"\n\nThen he sprang to his feet and cried:--\n\n\"Thanks, Father Madeleine!\"\n\nJean Valjean had merely fainted. The fresh air had revived him.\n\nJoy is the ebb of terror. Fauchelevent found almost as much difficulty\nin recovering himself as Jean Valjean had.\n\n\"So you are not dead! Oh! How wise you are! I called you so much that\nyou came back. When I saw your eyes shut, I said: 'Good! there he is,\nstifled,' I should have gone raving mad, mad enough for a strait jacket.\nThey would have put me in Bicetre. What do you suppose I should\nhave done if you had been dead? And your little girl? There's that\nfruit-seller,--she would never have understood it! The child is thrust\ninto your arms, and then--the grandfather is dead! What a story! good\nsaints of paradise, what a tale! Ah! you are alive, that's the best of\nit!\"\n\n\"I am cold,\" said Jean Valjean.\n\nThis remark recalled Fauchelevent thoroughly to reality, and there was\npressing need of it. The souls of these two men were troubled even when\nthey had recovered themselves, although they did not realize it,\nand there was about them something uncanny, which was the sinister\nbewilderment inspired by the place.\n\n\"Let us get out of here quickly,\" exclaimed Fauchelevent.\n\nHe fumbled in his pocket, and pulled out a gourd with which he had\nprovided himself.\n\n\"But first, take a drop,\" said he.\n\nThe flask finished what the fresh air had begun, Jean Valjean swallowed\na mouthful of brandy, and regained full possession of his faculties.\n\nHe got out of the coffin, and helped Fauchelevent to nail on the lid\nagain.\n\nThree minutes later they were out of the grave.\n\nMoreover, Fauchelevent was perfectly composed. He took his time. The\ncemetery was closed. The arrival of the grave-digger Gribier was not to\nbe apprehended. That \"conscript\" was at home busily engaged in looking\nfor his card, and at some difficulty in finding it in his lodgings,\nsince it was in Fauchelevent's pocket. Without a card, he could not get\nback into the cemetery.\n\nFauchelevent took the shovel, and Jean Valjean the pick-axe, and\ntogether they buried the empty coffin.\n\nWhen the grave was full, Fauchelevent said to Jean Valjean:--\n\n\"Let us go. I will keep the shovel; do you carry off the mattock.\"\n\nNight was falling.\n\nJean Valjean experienced rome difficulty in moving and in walking. He\nhad stiffened himself in that coffin, and had become a little like a\ncorpse. The rigidity of death had seized upon him between those four\nplanks. He had, in a manner, to thaw out, from the tomb.\n\n\"You are benumbed,\" said Fauchelevent. \"It is a pity that I have a game\nleg, for otherwise we might step out briskly.\"\n\n\"Bah!\" replied Jean Valjean, \"four paces will put life into my legs once\nmore.\"\n\nThey set off by the alleys through which the hearse had passed. On\narriving before the closed gate and the porter's pavilion Fauchelevent,\nwho held the grave-digger's card in his hand, dropped it into the box,\nthe porter pulled the rope, the gate opened, and they went out.\n\n\"How well everything is going!\" said Fauchelevent; \"what a capital idea\nthat was of yours, Father Madeleine!\"\n\nThey passed the Vaugirard barrier in the simplest manner in the world.\nIn the neighborhood of the cemetery, a shovel and pick are equal to two\npassports.\n\nThe Rue Vaugirard was deserted.\n\n\"Father Madeleine,\" said Fauchelevent as they went along, and raising\nhis eyes to the houses, \"Your eyes are better than mine. Show me No.\n87.\"\n\n\"Here it is,\" said Jean Valjean.\n\n\"There is no one in the street,\" said Fauchelevent. \"Give me your\nmattock and wait a couple of minutes for me.\"\n\nFauchelevent entered No. 87, ascended to the very top, guided by the\ninstinct which always leads the poor man to the garret, and knocked in\nthe dark, at the door of an attic.\n\nA voice replied: \"Come in.\"\n\nIt was Gribier's voice.\n\nFauchelevent opened the door. The grave-digger's dwelling was, like\nall such wretched habitations, an unfurnished and encumbered garret.\nA packing-case--a coffin, perhaps--took the place of a commode, a\nbutter-pot served for a drinking-fountain, a straw mattress served for\na bed, the floor served instead of tables and chairs. In a corner, on a\ntattered fragment which had been a piece of an old carpet, a thin\nwoman and a number of children were piled in a heap. The whole of this\npoverty-stricken interior bore traces of having been overturned. One\nwould have said that there had been an earthquake \"for one.\" The covers\nwere displaced, the rags scattered about, the jug broken, the mother had\nbeen crying, the children had probably been beaten; traces of a vigorous\nand ill-tempered search. It was plain that the grave-digger had made\na desperate search for his card, and had made everybody in the garret,\nfrom the jug to his wife, responsible for its loss. He wore an air of\ndesperation.\n\nBut Fauchelevent was in too great a hurry to terminate this adventure to\ntake any notice of this sad side of his success.\n\nHe entered and said:--\n\n\"I have brought you back your shovel and pick.\"\n\nGribier gazed at him in stupefaction.\n\n\"Is it you, peasant?\"\n\n\"And to-morrow morning you will find your card with the porter of the\ncemetery.\"\n\nAnd he laid the shovel and mattock on the floor.\n\n\"What is the meaning of this?\" demanded Gribier.\n\n\"The meaning of it is, that you dropped your card out of your pocket,\nthat I found it on the ground after you were gone, that I have buried\nthe corpse, that I have filled the grave, that I have done your work,\nthat the porter will return your card to you, and that you will not have\nto pay fifteen francs. There you have it, conscript.\"\n\n\"Thanks, villager!\" exclaimed Gribier, radiant. \"The next time I will\npay for the drinks.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII--A SUCCESSFUL INTERROGATORY\n\nAn hour later, in the darkness of night, two men and a child presented\nthemselves at No. 62 Rue Petit-Picpus. The elder of the men lifted the\nknocker and rapped.\n\nThey were Fauchelevent, Jean Valjean, and Cosette.\n\nThe two old men had gone to fetch Cosette from the fruiterer's in\nthe Rue du Chemin-Vert, where Fauchelevent had deposited her on the\npreceding day. Cosette had passed these twenty-four hours trembling\nsilently and understanding nothing. She trembled to such a degree that\nshe wept. She had neither eaten nor slept. The worthy fruit-seller had\nplied her with a hundred questions, without obtaining any other reply\nthan a melancholy and unvarying gaze. Cosette had betrayed nothing of\nwhat she had seen and heard during the last two days. She divined that\nthey were passing through a crisis. She was deeply conscious that it was\nnecessary to \"be good.\" Who has not experienced the sovereign power\nof those two words, pronounced with a certain accent in the ear of a\nterrified little being: Say nothing! Fear is mute. Moreover, no one\nguards a secret like a child.\n\nBut when, at the expiration of these lugubrious twenty-four hours, she\nbeheld Jean Valjean again, she gave vent to such a cry of joy, that any\nthoughtful person who had chanced to hear that cry, would have guessed\nthat it issued from an abyss.\n\nFauchelevent belonged to the convent and knew the pass-words. All the\ndoors opened.\n\nThus was solved the double and alarming problem of how to get out and\nhow to get in.\n\nThe porter, who had received his instructions, opened the little\nservant's door which connected the courtyard with the garden, and which\ncould still be seen from the street twenty years ago, in the wall at the\nbottom of the court, which faced the carriage entrance.\n\nThe porter admitted all three of them through this door, and from that\npoint they reached the inner, reserved parlor where Fauchelevent, on the\npreceding day, had received his orders from the prioress.\n\nThe prioress, rosary in hand, was waiting for them. A vocal mother, with\nher veil lowered, stood beside her.\n\nA discreet candle lighted, one might almost say, made a show of lighting\nthe parlor.\n\nThe prioress passed Jean Valjean in review. There is nothing which\nexamines like a downcast eye.\n\nThen she questioned him:--\n\n\"You are the brother?\"\n\n\"Yes, reverend Mother,\" replied Fauchelevent.\n\n\"What is your name?\"\n\nFauchelevent replied:--\n\n\"Ultime Fauchelevent.\"\n\nHe really had had a brother named Ultime, who was dead.\n\n\"Where do you come from?\"\n\nFauchelevent replied:--\n\n\"From Picquigny, near Amiens.\"\n\n\"What is your age?\"\n\nFauchelevent replied:--\n\n\"Fifty.\"\n\n\"What is your profession?\"\n\nFauchelevent replied:--\n\n\"Gardener.\"\n\n\"Are you a good Christian?\"\n\nFauchelevent replied:--\n\n\"Every one is in the family.\"\n\n\"Is this your little girl?\"\n\nFauchelevent replied:--\n\n\"Yes, reverend Mother.\"\n\n\"You are her father?\"\n\nFauchelevent replied:--\n\n\"Her grandfather.\"\n\nThe vocal mother said to the prioress in a low voice\n\n\"He answers well.\"\n\nJean Valjean had not uttered a single word.\n\nThe prioress looked attentively at Cosette, and said half aloud to the\nvocal mother:--\n\n\"She will grow up ugly.\"\n\nThe two mothers consulted for a few moments in very low tones in the\ncorner of the parlor, then the prioress turned round and said:--\n\n\"Father Fauvent, you will get another knee-cap with a bell. Two will be\nrequired now.\"\n\nOn the following day, therefore, two bells were audible in the garden,\nand the nuns could not resist the temptation to raise the corner of\ntheir veils. At the extreme end of the garden, under the trees, two\nmen, Fauvent and another man, were visible as they dug side by side. An\nenormous event. Their silence was broken to the extent of saying to each\nother: \"He is an assistant gardener.\"\n\nThe vocal mothers added: \"He is a brother of Father Fauvent.\"\n\nJean Valjean was, in fact, regularly installed; he had his belled\nknee-cap; henceforth he was official. His name was Ultime Fauchelevent.\n\nThe most powerful determining cause of his admission had been the\nprioress's observation upon Cosette: \"She will grow up ugly.\"\n\nThe prioress, that pronounced prognosticator, immediately took a fancy\nto Cosette and gave her a place in the school as a charity pupil.\n\nThere is nothing that is not strictly logical about this.\n\nIt is in vain that mirrors are banished from the convent, women are\nconscious of their faces; now, girls who are conscious of their beauty\ndo not easily become nuns; the vocation being voluntary in inverse\nproportion to their good looks, more is to be hoped from the ugly than\nfrom the pretty. Hence a lively taste for plain girls.\n\nThe whole of this adventure increased the importance of good, old\nFauchelevent; he won a triple success; in the eyes of Jean Valjean, whom\nhe had saved and sheltered; in those of grave-digger Gribier, who said\nto himself: \"He spared me that fine\"; with the convent, which, being\nenabled, thanks to him, to retain the coffin of Mother Crucifixion\nunder the altar, eluded Caesar and satisfied God. There was a coffin\ncontaining a body in the Petit-Picpus, and a coffin without a body in\nthe Vaugirard cemetery, public order had no doubt been deeply disturbed\nthereby, but no one was aware of it.\n\nAs for the convent, its gratitude to Fauchelevent was very great.\nFauchelevent became the best of servitors and the most precious of\ngardeners. Upon the occasion of the archbishop's next visit, the\nprioress recounted the affair to his Grace, making something of a\nconfession at the same time, and yet boasting of her deed. On leaving\nthe convent, the archbishop mentioned it with approval, and in a whisper\nto M. de Latil, Monsieur's confessor, afterwards Archbishop of Reims\nand Cardinal. This admiration for Fauchelevent became widespread, for it\nmade its way to Rome. We have seen a note addressed by the then reigning\nPope, Leo XII., to one of his relatives, a Monsignor in the Nuncio's\nestablishment in Paris, and bearing, like himself, the name of Della\nGenga; it contained these lines: \"It appears that there is in a convent\nin Paris an excellent gardener, who is also a holy man, named Fauvent.\"\nNothing of this triumph reached Fauchelevent in his hut; he went on\ngrafting, weeding, and covering up his melon beds, without in the least\nsuspecting his excellences and his sanctity. Neither did he suspect his\nglory, any more than a Durham or Surrey bull whose portrait is published\nin the London Illustrated News, with this inscription: \"Bull which\ncarried off the prize at the Cattle Show.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX--CLOISTERED\n\nCosette continued to hold her tongue in the convent.\n\nIt was quite natural that Cosette should think herself Jean Valjean's\ndaughter. Moreover, as she knew nothing, she could say nothing, and\nthen, she would not have said anything in any case. As we have just\nobserved, nothing trains children to silence like unhappiness. Cosette\nhad suffered so much, that she feared everything, even to speak or to\nbreathe. A single word had so often brought down an avalanche upon her.\nShe had hardly begun to regain her confidence since she had been with\nJean Valjean. She speedily became accustomed to the convent. Only she\nregretted Catherine, but she dared not say so. Once, however, she did\nsay to Jean Valjean: \"Father, if I had known, I would have brought her\naway with me.\"\n\nCosette had been obliged, on becoming a scholar in the convent, to don\nthe garb of the pupils of the house. Jean Valjean succeeded in getting\nthem to restore to him the garments which she laid aside. This was the\nsame mourning suit which he had made her put on when she had quitted\nthe Thenardiers' inn. It was not very threadbare even now. Jean Valjean\nlocked up these garments, plus the stockings and the shoes, with a\nquantity of camphor and all the aromatics in which convents abound, in a\nlittle valise which he found means of procuring. He set this valise on\na chair near his bed, and he always carried the key about his person.\n\"Father,\" Cosette asked him one day, \"what is there in that box which\nsmells so good?\"\n\nFather Fauchelevent received other recompense for his good action, in\naddition to the glory which we just mentioned, and of which he knew\nnothing; in the first place it made him happy; next, he had much less\nwork, since it was shared. Lastly, as he was very fond of snuff, he\nfound the presence of M. Madeleine an advantage, in that he used three\ntimes as much as he had done previously, and that in an infinitely more\nluxurious manner, seeing that M. Madeleine paid for it.\n\nThe nuns did not adopt the name of Ultime; they called Jean Valjean the\nother Fauvent.\n\nIf these holy women had possessed anything of Javert's glance, they\nwould eventually have noticed that when there was any errand to be\ndone outside in the behalf of the garden, it was always the elder\nFauchelevent, the old, the infirm, the lame man, who went, and never the\nother; but whether it is that eyes constantly fixed on God know not how\nto spy, or whether they were, by preference, occupied in keeping watch\non each other, they paid no heed to this.\n\nMoreover, it was well for Jean Valjean that he kept close and did not\nstir out. Javert watched the quarter for more than a month.\n\nThis convent was for Jean Valjean like an island surrounded by gulfs.\nHenceforth, those four walls constituted his world. He saw enough of the\nsky there to enable him to preserve his serenity, and Cosette enough to\nremain happy.\n\nA very sweet life began for him.\n\nHe inhabited the old hut at the end of the garden, in company with\nFauchelevent. This hovel, built of old rubbish, which was still in\nexistence in 1845, was composed, as the reader already knows, of three\nchambers, all of which were utterly bare and had nothing beyond the\nwalls. The principal one had been given up, by force, for Jean Valjean\nhad opposed it in vain, to M. Madeleine, by Father Fauchelevent. The\nwalls of this chamber had for ornament, in addition to the two nails\nwhereon to hang the knee-cap and the basket, a Royalist bank-note\nof '93, applied to the wall over the chimney-piece, and of which the\nfollowing is an exact facsimile:--\n\n\n[Illustration: Royalist Bank-note  2b8-9-banknote]\n\n\nThis specimen of Vendean paper money had been nailed to the wall by\nthe preceding gardener, an old Chouan, who had died in the convent, and\nwhose place Fauchelevent had taken.\n\nJean Valjean worked in the garden every day and made himself very\nuseful. He had formerly been a pruner of trees, and he gladly found\nhimself a gardener once more. It will be remembered that he knew all\nsorts of secrets and receipts for agriculture. He turned these to\nadvantage. Almost all the trees in the orchard were ungrafted, and wild.\nHe budded them and made them produce excellent fruit.\n\nCosette had permission to pass an hour with him every day. As the\nsisters were melancholy and he was kind, the child made comparisons and\nadored him. At the appointed hour she flew to the hut. When she entered\nthe lowly cabin, she filled it with paradise. Jean Valjean blossomed\nout and felt his happiness increase with the happiness which he afforded\nCosette. The joy which we inspire has this charming property, that, far\nfrom growing meagre, like all reflections, it returns to us more radiant\nthan ever. At recreation hours, Jean Valjean watched her running and\nplaying in the distance, and he distinguished her laugh from that of the\nrest.\n\nFor Cosette laughed now.\n\nCosette's face had even undergone a change, to a certain extent. The\ngloom had disappeared from it. A smile is the same as sunshine; it\nbanishes winter from the human countenance.\n\nRecreation over, when Cosette went into the house again, Jean Valjean\ngazed at the windows of her class-room, and at night he rose to look at\nthe windows of her dormitory.\n\nGod has his own ways, moreover; the convent contributed, like Cosette,\nto uphold and complete the Bishop's work in Jean Valjean. It is certain\nthat virtue adjoins pride on one side. A bridge built by the devil\nexists there. Jean Valjean had been, unconsciously, perhaps, tolerably\nnear that side and that bridge, when Providence cast his lot in the\nconvent of the Petit-Picpus; so long as he had compared himself only to\nthe Bishop, he had regarded himself as unworthy and had remained humble;\nbut for some time past he had been comparing himself to men in general,\nand pride was beginning to spring up. Who knows? He might have ended by\nreturning very gradually to hatred.\n\nThe convent stopped him on that downward path.\n\nThis was the second place of captivity which he had seen. In his youth,\nin what had been for him the beginning of his life, and later on, quite\nrecently again, he had beheld another,--a frightful place, a terrible\nplace, whose severities had always appeared to him the iniquity of\njustice, and the crime of the law. Now, after the galleys, he saw the\ncloister; and when he meditated how he had formed a part of the galleys,\nand that he now, so to speak, was a spectator of the cloister, he\nconfronted the two in his own mind with anxiety.\n\nSometimes he crossed his arms and leaned on his hoe, and slowly\ndescended the endless spirals of revery.\n\nHe recalled his former companions: how wretched they were; they rose at\ndawn, and toiled until night; hardly were they permitted to sleep; they\nlay on camp beds, where nothing was tolerated but mattresses two inches\nthick, in rooms which were heated only in the very harshest months of\nthe year; they were clothed in frightful red blouses; they were allowed,\nas a great favor, linen trousers in the hottest weather, and a woollen\ncarter's blouse on their backs when it was very cold; they drank no\nwine, and ate no meat, except when they went on \"fatigue duty.\" They\nlived nameless, designated only by numbers, and converted, after a\nmanner, into ciphers themselves, with downcast eyes, with lowered\nvoices, with shorn heads, beneath the cudgel and in disgrace.\n\nThen his mind reverted to the beings whom he had under his eyes.\n\nThese beings also lived with shorn heads, with downcast eyes, with\nlowered voices, not in disgrace, but amid the scoffs of the world,\nnot with their backs bruised with the cudgel, but with their shoulders\nlacerated with their discipline. Their names, also, had vanished from\namong men; they no longer existed except under austere appellations.\nThey never ate meat and they never drank wine; they often remained until\nevening without food; they were attired, not in a red blouse, but in a\nblack shroud, of woollen, which was heavy in summer and thin in winter,\nwithout the power to add or subtract anything from it; without having\neven, according to the season, the resource of the linen garment or the\nwoollen cloak; and for six months in the year they wore serge chemises\nwhich gave them fever. They dwelt, not in rooms warmed only during\nrigorous cold, but in cells where no fire was ever lighted; they slept,\nnot on mattresses two inches thick, but on straw. And finally, they were\nnot even allowed their sleep; every night, after a day of toil, they\nwere obliged, in the weariness of their first slumber, at the moment\nwhen they were falling sound asleep and beginning to get warm, to rouse\nthemselves, to rise and to go and pray in an ice-cold and gloomy chapel,\nwith their knees on the stones.\n\nOn certain days each of these beings in turn had to remain for twelve\nsuccessive hours in a kneeling posture, or prostrate, with face upon the\npavement, and arms outstretched in the form of a cross.\n\nThe others were men; these were women.\n\nWhat had those men done? They had stolen, violated, pillaged,\nmurdered, assassinated. They were bandits, counterfeiters, poisoners,\nincendiaries, murderers, parricides. What had these women done? They had\ndone nothing whatever.\n\nOn the one hand, highway robbery, fraud, deceit, violence, sensuality,\nhomicide, all sorts of sacrilege, every variety of crime; on the other,\none thing only, innocence.\n\nPerfect innocence, almost caught up into heaven in a mysterious\nassumption, attached to the earth by virtue, already possessing\nsomething of heaven through holiness.\n\nOn the one hand, confidences over crimes, which are exchanged in\nwhispers; on the other, the confession of faults made aloud. And what\ncrimes! And what faults!\n\nOn the one hand, miasms; on the other, an ineffable perfume. On the one\nhand, a moral pest, guarded from sight, penned up under the range of\ncannon, and literally devouring its plague-stricken victims; on\nthe other, the chaste flame of all souls on the same hearth. There,\ndarkness; here, the shadow; but a shadow filled with gleams of light,\nand of gleams full of radiance.\n\nTwo strongholds of slavery; but in the first, deliverance possible,\na legal limit always in sight, and then, escape. In the second,\nperpetuity; the sole hope, at the distant extremity of the future, that\nfaint light of liberty which men call death.\n\nIn the first, men are bound only with chains; in the other, chained by\nfaith.\n\nWhat flowed from the first? An immense curse, the gnashing of teeth,\nhatred, desperate viciousness, a cry of rage against human society, a\nsarcasm against heaven.\n\nWhat results flowed from the second? Blessings and love.\n\nAnd in these two places, so similar yet so unlike, these two species\nof beings who were so very unlike, were undergoing the same work,\nexpiation.\n\nJean Valjean understood thoroughly the expiation of the former; that\npersonal expiation, the expiation for one's self. But he did not\nunderstand that of these last, that of creatures without reproach and\nwithout stain, and he trembled as he asked himself: The expiation of\nwhat? What expiation?\n\nA voice within his conscience replied: \"The most divine of human\ngenerosities, the expiation for others.\"\n\nHere all personal theory is withheld; we are only the narrator; we\nplace ourselves at Jean Valjean's point of view, and we translate his\nimpressions.\n\nBefore his eyes he had the sublime summit of abnegation, the highest\npossible pitch of virtue; the innocence which pardons men their faults,\nand which expiates in their stead; servitude submitted to, torture\naccepted, punishment claimed by souls which have not sinned, for the\nsake of sparing it to souls which have fallen; the love of humanity\nswallowed up in the love of God, but even there preserving its distinct\nand mediatorial character; sweet and feeble beings possessing the misery\nof those who are punished and the smile of those who are recompensed.\n\nAnd he remembered that he had dared to murmur!\n\nOften, in the middle of the night, he rose to listen to the grateful\nsong of those innocent creatures weighed down with severities, and the\nblood ran cold in his veins at the thought that those who were justly\nchastised raised their voices heavenward only in blasphemy, and that he,\nwretch that he was, had shaken his fist at God.\n\nThere was one striking thing which caused him to meditate deeply, like\na warning whisper from Providence itself: the scaling of that wall, the\npassing of those barriers, the adventure accepted even at the risk of\ndeath, the painful and difficult ascent, all those efforts even, which\nhe had made to escape from that other place of expiation, he had made in\norder to gain entrance into this one. Was this a symbol of his destiny?\nThis house was a prison likewise and bore a melancholy resemblance to\nthat other one whence he had fled, and yet he had never conceived an\nidea of anything similar.\n\nAgain he beheld gratings, bolts, iron bars--to guard whom? Angels.\n\nThese lofty walls which he had seen around tigers, he now beheld once\nmore around lambs.\n\nThis was a place of expiation, and not of punishment; and yet, it was\nstill more austere, more gloomy, and more pitiless than the other.\n\nThese virgins were even more heavily burdened than the convicts. A cold,\nharsh wind, that wind which had chilled his youth, traversed the barred\nand padlocked grating of the vultures; a still harsher and more biting\nbreeze blew in the cage of these doves.\n\nWhy?\n\nWhen he thought on these things, all that was within him was lost in\namazement before this mystery of sublimity.\n\nIn these meditations, his pride vanished. He scrutinized his own heart\nin all manner of ways; he felt his pettiness, and many a time he wept.\nAll that had entered into his life for the last six months had led him\nback towards the Bishop's holy injunctions; Cosette through love, the\nconvent through humility.\n\nSometimes at eventide, in the twilight, at an hour when the garden was\ndeserted, he could be seen on his knees in the middle of the walk which\nskirted the chapel, in front of the window through which he had gazed on\nthe night of his arrival, and turned towards the spot where, as he knew,\nthe sister was making reparation, prostrated in prayer. Thus he prayed\nas he knelt before the sister.\n\nIt seemed as though he dared not kneel directly before God.\n\nEverything that surrounded him, that peaceful garden, those fragrant\nflowers, those children who uttered joyous cries, those grave and simple\nwomen, that silent cloister, slowly permeated him, and little by little,\nhis soul became compounded of silence like the cloister, of perfume like\nthe flowers, of simplicity like the women, of joy like the children.\nAnd then he reflected that these had been two houses of God which had\nreceived him in succession at two critical moments in his life: the\nfirst, when all doors were closed and when human society rejected him;\nthe second, at a moment when human society had again set out in pursuit\nof him, and when the galleys were again yawning; and that, had it not\nbeen for the first, he should have relapsed into crime, and had it not\nbeen for the second, into torment.\n\nHis whole heart melted in gratitude, and he loved more and more.\n\nMany years passed in this manner; Cosette was growing up.\n\n\n[THE END OF VOLUME II. \"COSETTE\"]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVOLUME III--MARIUS.\n\n\n[Illustration: Frontispiece Volume Three  3frontispiece]\n\n[Illustration: Titlepage Volume Three  3titlepage]\n\n\n\n\nBOOK FIRST.--PARIS STUDIED IN ITS ATOM\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I--PARVULUS\n\nParis has a child, and the forest has a bird; the bird is called the\nsparrow; the child is called the gamin.\n\nCouple these two ideas which contain, the one all the furnace, the other\nall the dawn; strike these two sparks together, Paris, childhood; there\nleaps out from them a little being. Homuncio, Plautus would say.\n\nThis little being is joyous. He has not food every day, and he goes to\nthe play every evening, if he sees good. He has no shirt on his body,\nno shoes on his feet, no roof over his head; he is like the flies of\nheaven, who have none of these things. He is from seven to thirteen\nyears of age, he lives in bands, roams the streets, lodges in the open\nair, wears an old pair of trousers of his father's, which descend below\nhis heels, an old hat of some other father, which descends below his\nears, a single suspender of yellow listing; he runs, lies in wait,\nrummages about, wastes time, blackens pipes, swears like a convict,\nhaunts the wine-shop, knows thieves, calls gay women thou, talks slang,\nsings obscene songs, and has no evil in his heart. This is because he\nhas in his heart a pearl, innocence; and pearls are not to be dissolved\nin mud. So long as man is in his childhood, God wills that he shall be\ninnocent.\n\nIf one were to ask that enormous city: \"What is this?\" she would reply:\n\"It is my little one.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II--SOME OF HIS PARTICULAR CHARACTERISTICS\n\nThe gamin--the street Arab--of Paris is the dwarf of the giant.\n\nLet us not exaggerate, this cherub of the gutter sometimes has a shirt,\nbut, in that case, he owns but one; he sometimes has shoes, but then\nthey have no soles; he sometimes has a lodging, and he loves it, for\nhe finds his mother there; but he prefers the street, because there he\nfinds liberty. He has his own games, his own bits of mischief, whose\nfoundation consists of hatred for the bourgeois; his peculiar metaphors:\nto be dead is to eat dandelions by the root; his own occupations,\ncalling hackney-coaches, letting down carriage-steps, establishing means\nof transit between the two sides of a street in heavy rains, which he\ncalls making the bridge of arts, crying discourses pronounced by the\nauthorities in favor of the French people, cleaning out the cracks\nin the pavement; he has his own coinage, which is composed of all the\nlittle morsels of worked copper which are found on the public streets.\nThis curious money, which receives the name of loques--rags--has\nan invariable and well-regulated currency in this little Bohemia of\nchildren.\n\nLastly, he has his own fauna, which he observes attentively in\nthe corners; the lady-bird, the death's-head plant-louse, the\ndaddy-long-legs, \"the devil,\" a black insect, which menaces by twisting\nabout its tail armed with two horns. He has his fabulous monster, which\nhas scales under its belly, but is not a lizard, which has pustules on\nits back, but is not a toad, which inhabits the nooks of old lime-kilns\nand wells that have run dry, which is black, hairy, sticky, which crawls\nsometimes slowly, sometimes rapidly, which has no cry, but which has a\nlook, and is so terrible that no one has ever beheld it; he calls this\nmonster \"the deaf thing.\" The search for these \"deaf things\" among\nthe stones is a joy of formidable nature. Another pleasure consists in\nsuddenly prying up a paving-stone, and taking a look at the wood-lice.\nEach region of Paris is celebrated for the interesting treasures which\nare to be found there. There are ear-wigs in the timber-yards of the\nUrsulines, there are millepeds in the Pantheon, there are tadpoles in\nthe ditches of the Champs-de-Mars.\n\nAs far as sayings are concerned, this child has as many of them as\nTalleyrand. He is no less cynical, but he is more honest. He is endowed\nwith a certain indescribable, unexpected joviality; he upsets the\ncomposure of the shopkeeper with his wild laughter. He ranges boldly\nfrom high comedy to farce.\n\nA funeral passes by. Among those who accompany the dead there is a\ndoctor. \"Hey there!\" shouts some street Arab, \"how long has it been\ncustomary for doctors to carry home their own work?\"\n\nAnother is in a crowd. A grave man, adorned with spectacles and\ntrinkets, turns round indignantly: \"You good-for-nothing, you have\nseized my wife's waist!\"--\"I, sir? Search me!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III--HE IS AGREEABLE\n\nIn the evening, thanks to a few sous, which he always finds means\nto procure, the homuncio enters a theatre. On crossing that magic\nthreshold, he becomes transfigured; he was the street Arab, he becomes\nthe titi.[18] Theatres are a sort of ship turned upside down with the\nkeel in the air. It is in that keel that the titi huddle together.\nThe titi is to the gamin what the moth is to the larva; the same being\nendowed with wings and soaring. It suffices for him to be there, with\nhis radiance of happiness, with his power of enthusiasm and joy, with\nhis hand-clapping, which resembles a clapping of wings, to confer on\nthat narrow, dark, fetid, sordid, unhealthy, hideous, abominable keel,\nthe name of Paradise.\n\nBestow on an individual the useless and deprive him of the necessary,\nand you have the gamin.\n\nThe gamin is not devoid of literary intuition. His tendency, and we say\nit with the proper amount of regret, would not constitute classic\ntaste. He is not very academic by nature. Thus, to give an example, the\npopularity of Mademoiselle Mars among that little audience of stormy\nchildren was seasoned with a touch of irony. The gamin called her\nMademoiselle Muche--\"hide yourself.\"\n\nThis being bawls and scoffs and ridicules and fights, has rags like a\nbaby and tatters like a philosopher, fishes in the sewer, hunts in the\ncesspool, extracts mirth from foulness, whips up the squares with his\nwit, grins and bites, whistles and sings, shouts, and shrieks, tempers\nAlleluia with Matantur-lurette, chants every rhythm from the De\nProfundis to the Jack-pudding, finds without seeking, knows what he is\nignorant of, is a Spartan to the point of thieving, is mad to wisdom, is\nlyrical to filth, would crouch down on Olympus, wallows in the dunghill\nand emerges from it covered with stars. The gamin of Paris is Rabelais\nin this youth.\n\nHe is not content with his trousers unless they have a watch-pocket.\n\nHe is not easily astonished, he is still less easily terrified, he makes\nsongs on superstitions, he takes the wind out of exaggerations, he twits\nmysteries, he thrusts out his tongue at ghosts, he takes the poetry out\nof stilted things, he introduces caricature into epic extravaganzas.\nIt is not that he is prosaic; far from that; but he replaces the solemn\nvision by the farcical phantasmagoria. If Adamastor were to appear to\nhim, the street Arab would say: \"Hi there! The bugaboo!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV--HE MAY BE OF USE\n\nParis begins with the lounger and ends with the street Arab, two\nbeings of which no other city is capable; the passive acceptance, which\ncontents itself with gazing, and the inexhaustible initiative; Prudhomme\nand Fouillou. Paris alone has this in its natural history. The whole of\nthe monarchy is contained in the lounger; the whole of anarchy in the\ngamin.\n\nThis pale child of the Parisian faubourgs lives and develops, makes\nconnections, \"grows supple\" in suffering, in the presence of social\nrealities and of human things, a thoughtful witness. He thinks himself\nheedless; and he is not. He looks and is on the verge of laughter; he is\non the verge of something else also. Whoever you may be, if your name is\nPrejudice, Abuse, Ignorance, Oppression, Iniquity, Despotism, Injustice,\nFanaticism, Tyranny, beware of the gaping gamin.\n\nThe little fellow will grow up.\n\nOf what clay is he made? Of the first mud that comes to hand. A handful\nof dirt, a breath, and behold Adam. It suffices for a God to pass by. A\nGod has always passed over the street Arab. Fortune labors at this tiny\nbeing. By the word \"fortune\" we mean chance, to some extent. That pigmy\nkneaded out of common earth, ignorant, unlettered, giddy, vulgar, low.\nWill that become an Ionian or a Boeotian? Wait, currit rota, the Spirit\nof Paris, that demon which creates the children of chance and the men\nof destiny, reversing the process of the Latin potter, makes of a jug an\namphora.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V--HIS FRONTIERS\n\nThe gamin loves the city, he also loves solitude, since he has something\nof the sage in him. Urbis amator, like Fuscus; ruris amator, like\nFlaccus.\n\nTo roam thoughtfully about, that is to say, to lounge, is a fine\nemployment of time in the eyes of the philosopher; particularly in that\nrather illegitimate species of campaign, which is tolerably ugly but\nodd and composed of two natures, which surrounds certain great cities,\nnotably Paris. To study the suburbs is to study the amphibious animal.\nEnd of the trees, beginning of the roofs; end of the grass, beginning\nof the pavements; end of the furrows, beginning of the shops, end of\nthe wheel-ruts, beginning of the passions; end of the divine murmur,\nbeginning of the human uproar; hence an extraordinary interest.\n\nHence, in these not very attractive places, indelibly stamped by the\npassing stroller with the epithet: melancholy, the apparently objectless\npromenades of the dreamer.\n\nHe who writes these lines has long been a prowler about the barriers\nof Paris, and it is for him a source of profound souvenirs. That\nclose-shaven turf, those pebbly paths, that chalk, those pools,\nthose harsh monotonies of waste and fallow lands, the plants of early\nmarket-garden suddenly springing into sight in a bottom, that mixture of\nthe savage and the citizen, those vast desert nooks where the garrison\ndrums practise noisily, and produce a sort of lisping of battle, those\nhermits by day and cut-throats by night, that clumsy mill which turns\nin the wind, the hoisting-wheels of the quarries, the tea-gardens at the\ncorners of the cemeteries; the mysterious charm of great, sombre walls\nsquarely intersecting immense, vague stretches of land inundated with\nsunshine and full of butterflies,--all this attracted him.\n\nThere is hardly any one on earth who is not acquainted with those\nsingular spots, the Glaciere, the Cunette, the hideous wall of Grenelle\nall speckled with balls, Mont-Parnasse, the Fosse-aux-Loups, Aubiers on\nthe bank of the Marne, Mont-Souris, the Tombe-Issoire, the Pierre-Plate\nde Chatillon, where there is an old, exhausted quarry which no longer\nserves any purpose except to raise mushrooms, and which is closed, on a\nlevel with the ground, by a trap-door of rotten planks. The campagna of\nRome is one idea, the banlieue of Paris is another; to behold nothing\nbut fields, houses, or trees in what a stretch of country offers us, is\nto remain on the surface; all aspects of things are thoughts of God. The\nspot where a plain effects its junction with a city is always stamped\nwith a certain piercing melancholy. Nature and humanity both appeal\nto you at the same time there. Local originalities there make their\nappearance.\n\nAny one who, like ourselves, has wandered about in these solitudes\ncontiguous to our faubourgs, which may be designated as the limbos of\nParis, has seen here and there, in the most desert spot, at the\nmost unexpected moment, behind a meagre hedge, or in the corner of a\nlugubrious wall, children grouped tumultuously, fetid, muddy,\ndusty, ragged, dishevelled, playing hide-and-seek, and crowned with\ncorn-flowers. All of them are little ones who have made their escape\nfrom poor families. The outer boulevard is their breathing space; the\nsuburbs belong to them. There they are eternally playing truant. There\nthey innocently sing their repertory of dirty songs. There they are, or\nrather, there they exist, far from every eye, in the sweet light of\nMay or June, kneeling round a hole in the ground, snapping marbles with\ntheir thumbs, quarrelling over half-farthings, irresponsible, volatile,\nfree and happy; and, no sooner do they catch sight of you than they\nrecollect that they have an industry, and that they must earn their\nliving, and they offer to sell you an old woollen stocking filled\nwith cockchafers, or a bunch of lilacs. These encounters with strange\nchildren are one of the charming and at the same time poignant graces of\nthe environs of Paris.\n\nSometimes there are little girls among the throng of boys,--are they\ntheir sisters?--who are almost young maidens, thin, feverish, with\nsunburnt hands, covered with freckles, crowned with poppies and ears of\nrye, gay, haggard, barefooted. They can be seen devouring cherries among\nthe wheat. In the evening they can be heard laughing. These groups,\nwarmly illuminated by the full glow of midday, or indistinctly seen in\nthe twilight, occupy the thoughtful man for a very long time, and these\nvisions mingle with his dreams.\n\nParis, centre, banlieue, circumference; this constitutes all the earth\nto those children. They never venture beyond this. They can no more\nescape from the Parisian atmosphere than fish can escape from the\nwater. For them, nothing exists two leagues beyond the barriers:\nIvry, Gentilly, Arcueil, Belleville, Aubervilliers, Menilmontant,\nChoisy-le-Roi, Billancourt, Mendon, Issy, Vanvre, Sevres, Puteaux,\nNeuilly, Gennevilliers, Colombes, Romainville, Chatou, Asnieres,\nBougival, Nanterre, Enghien, Noisy-le-Sec, Nogent, Gournay, Drancy,\nGonesse; the universe ends there.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI--A BIT OF HISTORY\n\nAt the epoch, nearly contemporary by the way, when the action of this\nbook takes place, there was not, as there is to-day, a policeman at\nthe corner of every street (a benefit which there is no time to discuss\nhere); stray children abounded in Paris. The statistics give an average\nof two hundred and sixty homeless children picked up annually at that\nperiod, by the police patrols, in unenclosed lands, in houses in process\nof construction, and under the arches of the bridges. One of these\nnests, which has become famous, produced \"the swallows of the bridge of\nArcola.\" This is, moreover, the most disastrous of social symptoms. All\ncrimes of the man begin in the vagabondage of the child.\n\nLet us make an exception in favor of Paris, nevertheless. In a relative\nmeasure, and in spite of the souvenir which we have just recalled, the\nexception is just. While in any other great city the vagabond child is\na lost man, while nearly everywhere the child left to itself is, in\nsome sort, sacrificed and abandoned to a kind of fatal immersion in the\npublic vices which devour in him honesty and conscience, the street boy\nof Paris, we insist on this point, however defaced and injured on the\nsurface, is almost intact on the interior. It is a magnificent thing to\nput on record, and one which shines forth in the splendid probity of our\npopular revolutions, that a certain incorruptibility results from the\nidea which exists in the air of Paris, as salt exists in the water of\nthe ocean. To breathe Paris preserves the soul.\n\nWhat we have just said takes away nothing of the anguish of heart which\none experiences every time that one meets one of these children around\nwhom one fancies that he beholds floating the threads of a broken\nfamily. In the civilization of the present day, incomplete as it still\nis, it is not a very abnormal thing to behold these fractured families\npouring themselves out into the darkness, not knowing clearly what has\nbecome of their children, and allowing their own entrails to fall on the\npublic highway. Hence these obscure destinies. This is called, for this\nsad thing has given rise to an expression, \"to be cast on the pavements\nof Paris.\"\n\nLet it be said by the way, that this abandonment of children was not\ndiscouraged by the ancient monarchy. A little of Egypt and Bohemia in\nthe lower regions suited the upper spheres, and compassed the aims of\nthe powerful. The hatred of instruction for the children of the people\nwas a dogma. What is the use of \"half-lights\"? Such was the countersign.\nNow, the erring child is the corollary of the ignorant child.\n\nBesides this, the monarchy sometimes was in need of children, and in\nthat case it skimmed the streets.\n\nUnder Louis XIV., not to go any further back, the king rightly desired\nto create a fleet. The idea was a good one. But let us consider\nthe means. There can be no fleet, if, beside the sailing ship, that\nplaything of the winds, and for the purpose of towing it, in case of\nnecessity, there is not the vessel which goes where it pleases, either\nby means of oars or of steam; the galleys were then to the marine what\nsteamers are to-day. Therefore, galleys were necessary; but the galley\nis moved only by the galley-slave; hence, galley-slaves were required.\nColbert had the commissioners of provinces and the parliaments make\nas many convicts as possible. The magistracy showed a great deal of\ncomplaisance in the matter. A man kept his hat on in the presence of a\nprocession--it was a Huguenot attitude; he was sent to the galleys. A\nchild was encountered in the streets; provided that he was fifteen\nyears of age and did not know where he was to sleep, he was sent to the\ngalleys. Grand reign; grand century.\n\nUnder Louis XV. children disappeared in Paris; the police carried them\noff, for what mysterious purpose no one knew. People whispered with\nterror monstrous conjectures as to the king's baths of purple. Barbier\nspeaks ingenuously of these things. It sometimes happened that the\nexempts of the guard, when they ran short of children, took those who\nhad fathers. The fathers, in despair, attacked the exempts. In that\ncase, the parliament intervened and had some one hung. Who? The exempts?\nNo, the fathers.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII--THE GAMIN SHOULD HAVE HIS PLACE IN THE CLASSIFICATIONS OF\nINDIA\n\nThe body of street Arabs in Paris almost constitutes a caste. One might\nalmost say: Not every one who wishes to belong to it can do so.\n\nThis word gamin was printed for the first time, and reached popular\nspeech through the literary tongue, in 1834. It is in a little work\nentitled Claude Gueux that this word made its appearance. The horror was\nlively. The word passed into circulation.\n\nThe elements which constitute the consideration of the gamins for each\nother are very various. We have known and associated with one who was\ngreatly respected and vastly admired because he had seen a man fall from\nthe top of the tower of Notre-Dame; another, because he had succeeded in\nmaking his way into the rear courtyard where the statues of the dome\nof the Invalides had been temporarily deposited, and had \"prigged\" some\nlead from them; a third, because he had seen a diligence tip over; still\nanother, because he \"knew\" a soldier who came near putting out the eye\nof a citizen.\n\nThis explains that famous exclamation of a Parisian gamin, a profound\nepiphonema, which the vulgar herd laughs at without comprehending,--Dieu\nde Dieu! What ill-luck I do have! to think that I have never yet seen\nanybody tumble from a fifth-story window! (I have pronounced I'ave and\nfifth pronounced fift'.)\n\nSurely, this saying of a peasant is a fine one: \"Father So-and-So, your\nwife has died of her malady; why did you not send for the doctor?\"\n\"What would you have, sir, we poor folks die of ourselves.\" But if\nthe peasant's whole passivity lies in this saying, the whole of the\nfree-thinking anarchy of the brat of the faubourgs is, assuredly,\ncontained in this other saying. A man condemned to death is listening\nto his confessor in the tumbrel. The child of Paris exclaims: \"He is\ntalking to his black cap! Oh, the sneak!\"\n\nA certain audacity on matters of religion sets off the gamin. To be\nstrong-minded is an important item.\n\nTo be present at executions constitutes a duty. He shows himself at the\nguillotine, and he laughs. He calls it by all sorts of pet names: The\nEnd of the Soup, The Growler, The Mother in the Blue (the sky), The Last\nMouthful, etc., etc. In order not to lose anything of the affair, he\nscales the walls, he hoists himself to balconies, he ascends trees, he\nsuspends himself to gratings, he clings fast to chimneys. The gamin is\nborn a tiler as he is born a mariner. A roof inspires him with no more\nfear than a mast. There is no festival which comes up to an execution\non the Place de Greve. Samson and the Abbe Montes are the truly popular\nnames. They hoot at the victim in order to encourage him. They sometimes\nadmire him. Lacenaire, when a gamin, on seeing the hideous Dautin die\nbravely, uttered these words which contain a future: \"I was jealous of\nhim.\" In the brotherhood of gamins Voltaire is not known, but Papavoine\nis. \"Politicians\" are confused with assassins in the same legend.\nThey have a tradition as to everybody's last garment. It is known that\nTolleron had a fireman's cap, Avril an otter cap, Losvel a round hat,\nthat old Delaporte was bald and bare-headed, that Castaing was all ruddy\nand very handsome, that Bories had a romantic small beard, that Jean\nMartin kept on his suspenders, that Lecouffe and his mother quarrelled.\n\"Don't reproach each other for your basket,\" shouted a gamin to them.\nAnother, in order to get a look at Debacker as he passed, and being too\nsmall in the crowd, caught sight of the lantern on the quay and climbed\nit. A gendarme stationed opposite frowned. \"Let me climb up, m'sieu le\ngendarme,\" said the gamin. And, to soften the heart of the authorities\nhe added: \"I will not fall.\" \"I don't care if you do,\" retorted the\ngendarme.\n\nIn the brotherhood of gamins, a memorable accident counts for a great\ndeal. One reaches the height of consideration if one chances to cut\none's self very deeply, \"to the very bone.\"\n\nThe fist is no mediocre element of respect. One of the things that the\ngamin is fondest of saying is: \"I am fine and strong, come now!\" To be\nleft-handed renders you very enviable. A squint is highly esteemed.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII--IN WHICH THE READER WILL FIND A CHARMING SAYING OF THE\nLAST KING\n\nIn summer, he metamorphoses himself into a frog; and in the evening,\nwhen night is falling, in front of the bridges of Austerlitz and Jena,\nfrom the tops of coal wagons, and the washerwomen's boats, he hurls\nhimself headlong into the Seine, and into all possible infractions of\nthe laws of modesty and of the police. Nevertheless the police keep an\neye on him, and the result is a highly dramatic situation which\nonce gave rise to a fraternal and memorable cry; that cry which was\ncelebrated about 1830, is a strategic warning from gamin to gamin; it\nscans like a verse from Homer, with a notation as inexpressible as the\neleusiac chant of the Panathenaea, and in it one encounters again the\nancient Evohe. Here it is: \"Ohe, Titi, oheee! Here comes the bobby, here\ncomes the p'lice, pick up your duds and be off, through the sewer with\nyou!\"\n\nSometimes this gnat--that is what he calls himself--knows how to read;\nsometimes he knows how to write; he always knows how to daub. He\ndoes not hesitate to acquire, by no one knows what mysterious mutual\ninstruction, all the talents which can be of use to the public; from\n1815 to 1830, he imitated the cry of the turkey; from 1830 to 1848, he\nscrawled pears on the walls. One summer evening, when Louis Philippe was\nreturning home on foot, he saw a little fellow, no higher than his knee,\nperspiring and climbing up to draw a gigantic pear in charcoal on one\nof the pillars of the gate of Neuilly; the King, with that good-nature\nwhich came to him from Henry IV., helped the gamin, finished the pear,\nand gave the child a louis, saying: \"The pear is on that also.\"[19]\nThe gamin loves uproar. A certain state of violence pleases him. He\nexecrates \"the cures.\" One day, in the Rue de l'Universite, one of these\nscamps was putting his thumb to his nose at the carriage gate of No.\n69. \"Why are you doing that at the gate?\" a passer-by asked. The boy\nreplied: \"There is a cure there.\" It was there, in fact, that the Papal\nNuncio lived.\n\nNevertheless, whatever may be the Voltairianism of the small gamin, if\nthe occasion to become a chorister presents itself, it is quite possible\nthat he will accept, and in that case he serves the mass civilly. There\nare two things to which he plays Tantalus, and which he always desires\nwithout ever attaining them: to overthrow the government, and to get his\ntrousers sewed up again.\n\nThe gamin in his perfect state possesses all the policemen of Paris, and\ncan always put the name to the face of any one which he chances to\nmeet. He can tell them off on the tips of his fingers. He studies their\nhabits, and he has special notes on each one of them. He reads the souls\nof the police like an open book. He will tell you fluently and without\nflinching: \"Such an one is a traitor; such another is very malicious;\nsuch another is great; such another is ridiculous.\" (All these words:\ntraitor, malicious, great, ridiculous, have a particular meaning in his\nmouth.) That one imagines that he owns the Pont-Neuf, and he prevents\npeople from walking on the cornice outside the parapet; that other has a\nmania for pulling person's ears; etc., etc.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX--THE OLD SOUL OF GAUL\n\nThere was something of that boy in Poquelin, the son of the fish-market;\nBeaumarchais had something of it. Gaminerie is a shade of the Gallic\nspirit. Mingled with good sense, it sometimes adds force to the latter,\nas alcohol does to wine. Sometimes it is a defect. Homer repeats himself\neternally, granted; one may say that Voltaire plays the gamin. Camille\nDesmoulins was a native of the faubourgs. Championnet, who treated\nmiracles brutally, rose from the pavements of Paris; he had, when a\nsmall lad, inundated the porticos of Saint-Jean de Beauvais, and of\nSaint-Etienne du Mont; he had addressed the shrine of Sainte-Genevieve\nfamiliarly to give orders to the phial of Saint Januarius.\n\nThe gamin of Paris is respectful, ironical, and insolent. He has\nvillainous teeth, because he is badly fed and his stomach suffers, and\nhandsome eyes because he has wit. If Jehovah himself were present, he\nwould go hopping up the steps of paradise on one foot. He is strong on\nboxing. All beliefs are possible to him. He plays in the gutter, and\nstraightens himself up with a revolt; his effrontery persists even in\nthe presence of grape-shot; he was a scapegrace, he is a hero; like the\nlittle Theban, he shakes the skin from the lion; Barra the drummer-boy\nwas a gamin of Paris; he Shouts: \"Forward!\" as the horse of Scripture\nsays \"Vah!\" and in a moment he has passed from the small brat to the\ngiant.\n\nThis child of the puddle is also the child of the ideal. Measure that\nspread of wings which reaches from Moliere to Barra.\n\nTo sum up the whole, and in one word, the gamin is a being who amuses\nhimself, because he is unhappy.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X--ECCE PARIS, ECCE HOMO\n\nTo sum it all up once more, the Paris gamin of to-day, like the\ngraeculus of Rome in days gone by, is the infant populace with the\nwrinkle of the old world on his brow.\n\nThe gamin is a grace to the nation, and at the same time a disease; a\ndisease which must be cured, how? By light.\n\nLight renders healthy.\n\nLight kindles.\n\nAll generous social irradiations spring from science, letters, arts,\neducation. Make men, make men. Give them light that they may warm\nyou. Sooner or later the splendid question of universal education will\npresent itself with the irresistible authority of the absolute truth;\nand then, those who govern under the superintendence of the French idea\nwill have to make this choice; the children of France or the gamins of\nParis; flames in the light or will-o'-the-wisps in the gloom.\n\nThe gamin expresses Paris, and Paris expresses the world.\n\nFor Paris is a total. Paris is the ceiling of the human race. The whole\nof this prodigious city is a foreshortening of dead manners and living\nmanners. He who sees Paris thinks he sees the bottom of all history with\nheaven and constellations in the intervals. Paris has a capital, the\nTown-Hall, a Parthenon, Notre-Dame, a Mount Aventine, the Faubourg\nSaint-Antoine, an Asinarium, the Sorbonne, a Pantheon, the Pantheon, a\nVia Sacra, the Boulevard des Italiens, a temple of the winds, opinion;\nand it replaces the Gemoniae by ridicule. Its majo is called \"faraud,\"\nits Transteverin is the man of the faubourgs, its hammal is the\nmarket-porter, its lazzarone is the pegre, its cockney is the native of\nGhent. Everything that exists elsewhere exists at Paris. The fishwoman\nof Dumarsais can retort on the herb-seller of Euripides, the\ndiscobols Vejanus lives again in the Forioso, the tight-rope dancer.\nTherapontigonus Miles could walk arm in arm with Vadeboncoeur the\ngrenadier, Damasippus the second-hand dealer would be happy among\nbric-a-brac merchants, Vincennes could grasp Socrates in its fist as\njust as Agora could imprison Diderot, Grimod de la Reyniere discovered\nlarded roast beef, as Curtillus invented roast hedgehog, we see the\ntrapeze which figures in Plautus reappear under the vault of the Arc\nof l'Etoile, the sword-eater of Poecilus encountered by Apuleius is a\nsword-swallower on the Pont Neuf, the nephew of Rameau and Curculio\nthe parasite make a pair, Ergasilus could get himself presented to\nCambaceres by d'Aigrefeuille; the four dandies of Rome: Alcesimarchus,\nPhoedromus, Diabolus, and Argyrippus, descend from Courtille in\nLabatut's posting-chaise; Aulus Gellius would halt no longer in front of\nCongrio than would Charles Nodier in front of Punchinello; Marto is not\na tigress, but Pardalisca was not a dragon; Pantolabus the wag jeers in\nthe Cafe Anglais at Nomentanus the fast liver, Hermogenus is a tenor\nin the Champs-Elysees, and round him, Thracius the beggar, clad like\nBobeche, takes up a collection; the bore who stops you by the button\nof your coat in the Tuileries makes you repeat after a lapse of two\nthousand years Thesprion's apostrophe: Quis properantem me prehendit\npallio? The wine on Surene is a parody of the wine of Alba, the red\nborder of Desaugiers forms a balance to the great cutting of Balatro,\nPere Lachaise exhales beneath nocturnal rains same gleams as the\nEsquiliae, and the grave of the poor bought for five years, is certainly\nthe equivalent of the slave's hived coffin.\n\nSeek something that Paris has not. The vat of Trophonius contains\nnothing that is not in Mesmer's tub; Ergaphilas lives again in\nCagliostro; the Brahmin Vasaphanta become incarnate in the Comte de\nSaint-Germain; the cemetery of Saint-Medard works quite as good miracles\nas the Mosque of Oumoumie at Damascus.\n\nParis has an AEsop-Mayeux, and a Canidia, Mademoiselle Lenormand. It is\nterrified, like Delphos at the fulgurating realities of the vision; it\nmakes tables turn as Dodona did tripods. It places the grisette on the\nthrone, as Rome placed the courtesan there; and, taking it altogether,\nif Louis XV. is worse than Claudian, Madame Dubarry is better than\nMessalina. Paris combines in an unprecedented type, which has existed\nand which we have elbowed, Grecian nudity, the Hebraic ulcer, and the\nGascon pun. It mingles Diogenes, Job, and Jack-pudding, dresses up a\nspectre in old numbers of the Constitutional, and makes Chodruc Duclos.\n\nAlthough Plutarch says: the tyrant never grows old, Rome, under Sylla as\nunder Domitian, resigned itself and willingly put water in its wine. The\nTiber was a Lethe, if the rather doctrinary eulogium made of it by Varus\nVibiscus is to be credited: Contra Gracchos Tiberim habemus, Bibere\nTiberim, id est seditionem oblivisci. Paris drinks a million litres of\nwater a day, but that does not prevent it from occasionally beating the\ngeneral alarm and ringing the tocsin.\n\nWith that exception, Paris is amiable. It accepts everything royally;\nit is not too particular about its Venus; its Callipyge is Hottentot;\nprovided that it is made to laugh, it condones; ugliness cheers it,\ndeformity provokes it to laughter, vice diverts it; be eccentric and\nyou may be an eccentric; even hypocrisy, that supreme cynicism, does\nnot disgust it; it is so literary that it does not hold its nose before\nBasile, and is no more scandalized by the prayer of Tartuffe than Horace\nwas repelled by the \"hiccup\" of Priapus. No trait of the universal face\nis lacking in the profile of Paris. The bal Mabile is not the polymnia\ndance of the Janiculum, but the dealer in ladies' wearing apparel there\ndevours the lorette with her eyes, exactly as the procuress Staphyla\nlay in wait for the virgin Planesium. The Barriere du Combat is not\nthe Coliseum, but people are as ferocious there as though Caesar were\nlooking on. The Syrian hostess has more grace than Mother Saguet,\nbut, if Virgil haunted the Roman wine-shop, David d'Angers, Balzac\nand Charlet have sat at the tables of Parisian taverns. Paris reigns.\nGeniuses flash forth there, the red tails prosper there. Adonai passes\non his chariot with its twelve wheels of thunder and lightning; Silenus\nmakes his entry there on his ass. For Silenus read Ramponneau.\n\nParis is the synonym of Cosmos, Paris is Athens, Sybaris, Jerusalem,\nPantin. All civilizations are there in an abridged form, all barbarisms\nalso. Paris would greatly regret it if it had not a guillotine.\n\nA little of the Place de Greve is a good thing. What would all that\neternal festival be without this seasoning? Our laws are wisely\nprovided, and thanks to them, this blade drips on this Shrove Tuesday.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI--TO SCOFF, TO REIGN\n\nThere is no limit to Paris. No city has had that domination which\nsometimes derides those whom it subjugates. To please you, O Athenians!\nexclaimed Alexander. Paris makes more than the law, it makes the\nfashion; Paris sets more than the fashion, it sets the routine. Paris\nmay be stupid, if it sees fit; it sometimes allows itself this luxury;\nthen the universe is stupid in company with it; then Paris awakes, rubs\nits eyes, says: \"How stupid I am!\" and bursts out laughing in the face\nof the human race. What a marvel is such a city! it is a strange thing\nthat this grandioseness and this burlesque should be amicable neighbors,\nthat all this majesty should not be thrown into disorder by all this\nparody, and that the same mouth can to-day blow into the trump of the\nJudgment Day, and to-morrow into the reed-flute! Paris has a sovereign\njoviality. Its gayety is of the thunder and its farce holds a sceptre.\n\nIts tempest sometimes proceeds from a grimace. Its explosions, its days,\nits masterpieces, its prodigies, its epics, go forth to the bounds of\nthe universe, and so also do its cock-and-bull stories. Its laugh is the\nmouth of a volcano which spatters the whole earth. Its jests are sparks.\nIt imposes its caricatures as well as its ideal on people; the highest\nmonuments of human civilization accept its ironies and lend their\neternity to its mischievous pranks. It is superb; it has a prodigious\n14th of July, which delivers the globe; it forces all nations to take\nthe oath of tennis; its night of the 4th of August dissolves in three\nhours a thousand years of feudalism; it makes of its logic the muscle\nof unanimous will; it multiplies itself under all sorts of forms of\nthe sublime; it fills with its light Washington, Kosciusko, Bolivar,\nBozzaris, Riego, Bem, Manin, Lopez, John Brown, Garibaldi; it is\neverywhere where the future is being lighted up, at Boston in 1779,\nat the Isle de Leon in 1820, at Pesth in 1848, at Palermo in 1860, it\nwhispers the mighty countersign: Liberty, in the ear of the American\nabolitionists grouped about the boat at Harper's Ferry, and in the ear\nof the patriots of Ancona assembled in the shadow, to the Archi before\nthe Gozzi inn on the seashore; it creates Canaris; it creates Quiroga;\nit creates Pisacane; it irradiates the great on earth; it was while\nproceeding whither its breath urge them, that Byron perished at\nMissolonghi, and that Mazet died at Barcelona; it is the tribune under\nthe feet of Mirabeau, and a crater under the feet of Robespierre;\nits books, its theatre, its art, its science, its literature, its\nphilosophy, are the manuals of the human race; it has Pascal, Regnier,\nCorneille, Descartes, Jean-Jacques: Voltaire for all moments, Moliere\nfor all centuries; it makes its language to be talked by the universal\nmouth, and that language becomes the word; it constructs in all minds\nthe idea of progress, the liberating dogmas which it forges are for the\ngenerations trusty friends, and it is with the soul of its thinkers and\nits poets that all heroes of all nations have been made since 1789; this\ndoes not prevent vagabondism, and that enormous genius which is called\nParis, while transfiguring the world by its light, sketches in charcoal\nBouginier's nose on the wall of the temple of Theseus and writes\nCredeville the thief on the Pyramids.\n\nParis is always showing its teeth; when it is not scolding it is\nlaughing.\n\nSuch is Paris. The smoke of its roofs forms the ideas of the universe. A\nheap of mud and stone, if you will, but, above all, a moral being. It is\nmore than great, it is immense. Why? Because it is daring.\n\nTo dare; that is the price of progress.\n\nAll sublime conquests are, more or less, the prizes of daring. In\norder that the Revolution should take place, it does not suffice that\nMontesquieu should foresee it, that Diderot should preach it, that\nBeaumarchais should announce it, that Condorcet should calculate it,\nthat Arouet should prepare it, that Rousseau should premeditate it; it\nis necessary that Danton should dare it.\n\nThe cry: Audacity! is a Fiat lux. It is necessary, for the sake of the\nforward march of the human race, that there should be proud lessons of\ncourage permanently on the heights. Daring deeds dazzle history and are\none of man's great sources of light. The dawn dares when it rises. To\nattempt, to brave, to persist, to persevere, to be faithful to one's\nself, to grasp fate bodily, to astound catastrophe by the small amount\nof fear that it occasions us, now to affront unjust power, again to\ninsult drunken victory, to hold one's position, to stand one's ground;\nthat is the example which nations need, that is the light which\nelectrifies them. The same formidable lightning proceeds from the torch\nof Prometheus to Cambronne's short pipe.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII--THE FUTURE LATENT IN THE PEOPLE\n\nAs for the Parisian populace, even when a man grown, it is always the\nstreet Arab; to paint the child is to paint the city; and it is for that\nreason that we have studied this eagle in this arrant sparrow. It is in\nthe faubourgs, above all, we maintain, that the Parisian race appears;\nthere is the pure blood; there is the true physiognomy; there this\npeople toils and suffers, and suffering and toil are the two faces of\nman. There exist there immense numbers of unknown beings, among whom\nswarm types of the strangest, from the porter of la Rapee to the knacker\nof Montfaucon. Fex urbis, exclaims Cicero; mob, adds Burke, indignantly;\nrabble, multitude, populace. These are words and quickly uttered. But\nso be it. What does it matter? What is it to me if they do go barefoot!\nThey do not know how to read; so much the worse. Would you abandon them\nfor that? Would you turn their distress into a malediction? Cannot the\nlight penetrate these masses? Let us return to that cry: Light! and let\nus obstinately persist therein! Light! Light! Who knows whether\nthese opacities will not become transparent? Are not revolutions\ntransfigurations? Come, philosophers, teach, enlighten, light up, think\naloud, speak aloud, hasten joyously to the great sun, fraternize with\nthe public place, announce the good news, spend your alphabets lavishly,\nproclaim rights, sing the Marseillaises, sow enthusiasms, tear green\nboughs from the oaks. Make a whirlwind of the idea. This crowd may\nbe rendered sublime. Let us learn how to make use of that vast\nconflagration of principles and virtues, which sparkles, bursts forth\nand quivers at certain hours. These bare feet, these bare arms, these\nrags, these ignorances, these abjectnesses, these darknesses, may be\nemployed in the conquest of the ideal. Gaze past the people, and you\nwill perceive truth. Let that vile sand which you trample under foot be\ncast into the furnace, let it melt and seethe there, it will become a\nsplendid crystal, and it is thanks to it that Galileo and Newton will\ndiscover stars.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII--LITTLE GAVROCHE\n\n[Illustration: Little Gavroche  3b1-13-gavroche]\n\nEight or nine years after the events narrated in the second part of this\nstory, people noticed on the Boulevard du Temple, and in the regions of\nthe Chateau-d'Eau, a little boy eleven or twelve years of age, who would\nhave realized with tolerable accuracy that ideal of the gamin sketched\nout above, if, with the laugh of his age on his lips, he had not had a\nheart absolutely sombre and empty. This child was well muffled up in a\npair of man's trousers, but he did not get them from his father, and a\nwoman's chemise, but he did not get it from his mother. Some people or\nother had clothed him in rags out of charity. Still, he had a father and\na mother. But his father did not think of him, and his mother did not\nlove him.\n\nHe was one of those children most deserving of pity, among all, one of\nthose who have father and mother, and who are orphans nevertheless.\n\nThis child never felt so well as when he was in the street. The\npavements were less hard to him than his mother's heart.\n\nHis parents had despatched him into life with a kick.\n\nHe simply took flight.\n\nHe was a boisterous, pallid, nimble, wide-awake, jeering, lad, with a\nvivacious but sickly air. He went and came, sang, played at hopscotch,\nscraped the gutters, stole a little, but, like cats and sparrows, gayly\nlaughed when he was called a rogue, and got angry when called a thief.\nHe had no shelter, no bread, no fire, no love; but he was merry because\nhe was free.\n\nWhen these poor creatures grow to be men, the millstones of the social\norder meet them and crush them, but so long as they are children, they\nescape because of their smallness. The tiniest hole saves them.\n\nNevertheless, abandoned as this child was, it sometimes happened, every\ntwo or three months, that he said, \"Come, I'll go and see mamma!\" Then\nhe quitted the boulevard, the Cirque, the Porte Saint-Martin, descended\nto the quays, crossed the bridges, reached the suburbs, arrived at the\nSalpetriere, and came to a halt, where? Precisely at that double number\n50-52 with which the reader is acquainted--at the Gorbeau hovel.\n\nAt that epoch, the hovel 50-52 generally deserted and eternally\ndecorated with the placard: \"Chambers to let,\" chanced to be, a rare\nthing, inhabited by numerous individuals who, however, as is always the\ncase in Paris, had no connection with each other. All belonged to\nthat indigent class which begins to separate from the lowest of petty\nbourgeoisie in straitened circumstances, and which extends from misery\nto misery into the lowest depths of society down to those two beings\nin whom all the material things of civilization end, the sewer-man who\nsweeps up the mud, and the ragpicker who collects scraps.\n\nThe \"principal lodger\" of Jean Valjean's day was dead and had been\nreplaced by another exactly like her. I know not what philosopher has\nsaid: \"Old women are never lacking.\"\n\nThis new old woman was named Madame Bourgon, and had nothing remarkable\nabout her life except a dynasty of three paroquets, who had reigned in\nsuccession over her soul.\n\nThe most miserable of those who inhabited the hovel were a family of\nfour persons, consisting of father, mother, and two daughters, already\nwell grown, all four of whom were lodged in the same attic, one of the\ncells which we have already mentioned.\n\nAt first sight, this family presented no very special feature except its\nextreme destitution; the father, when he hired the chamber, had stated\nthat his name was Jondrette. Some time after his moving in, which had\nborne a singular resemblance to the entrance of nothing at all, to\nborrow the memorable expression of the principal tenant, this Jondrette\nhad said to the woman, who, like her predecessor, was at the same time\nportress and stair-sweeper: \"Mother So-and-So, if any one should chance\nto come and inquire for a Pole or an Italian, or even a Spaniard,\nperchance, it is I.\"\n\nThis family was that of the merry barefoot boy. He arrived there and\nfound distress, and, what is still sadder, no smile; a cold hearth\nand cold hearts. When he entered, he was asked: \"Whence come you?\" He\nreplied: \"From the street.\" When he went away, they asked him: \"Whither\nare you going?\" He replied: \"Into the streets.\" His mother said to him:\n\"What did you come here for?\"\n\nThis child lived, in this absence of affection, like the pale plants\nwhich spring up in cellars. It did not cause him suffering, and he\nblamed no one. He did not know exactly how a father and mother should\nbe.\n\nNevertheless, his mother loved his sisters.\n\nWe have forgotten to mention, that on the Boulevard du Temple this child\nwas called Little Gavroche. Why was he called Little Gavroche?\n\nProbably because his father's name was Jondrette.\n\nIt seems to be the instinct of certain wretched families to break the\nthread.\n\nThe chamber which the Jondrettes inhabited in the Gorbeau hovel was the\nlast at the end of the corridor. The cell next to it was occupied by a\nvery poor young man who was called M. Marius.\n\nLet us explain who this M. Marius was.\n\n\n\n\nBOOK SECOND.--THE GREAT BOURGEOIS\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I--NINETY YEARS AND THIRTY-TWO TEETH\n\nIn the Rue Boucherat, Rue de Normandie and the Rue de Saintonge there\nstill exist a few ancient inhabitants who have preserved the memory of a\nworthy man named M. Gillenormand, and who mention him with complaisance.\nThis good man was old when they were young. This silhouette has not yet\nentirely disappeared--for those who regard with melancholy that vague\nswarm of shadows which is called the past--from the labyrinth of streets\nin the vicinity of the Temple to which, under Louis XIV., the names of\nall the provinces of France were appended exactly as in our day, the\nstreets of the new Tivoli quarter have received the names of all the\ncapitals of Europe; a progression, by the way, in which progress is\nvisible.\n\nM.Gillenormand, who was as much alive as possible in 1831, was one of\nthose men who had become curiosities to be viewed, simply because\nthey have lived a long time, and who are strange because they formerly\nresembled everybody, and now resemble nobody. He was a peculiar old man,\nand in very truth, a man of another age, the real, complete and rather\nhaughty bourgeois of the eighteenth century, who wore his good, old\nbourgeoisie with the air with which marquises wear their marquisates. He\nwas over ninety years of age, his walk was erect, he talked loudly, saw\nclearly, drank neat, ate, slept, and snored. He had all thirty-two of\nhis teeth. He only wore spectacles when he read. He was of an amorous\ndisposition, but declared that, for the last ten years, he had wholly\nand decidedly renounced women. He could no longer please, he said; he\ndid not add: \"I am too old,\" but: \"I am too poor.\" He said: \"If I were\nnot ruined--Heee!\" All he had left, in fact, was an income of about\nfifteen thousand francs. His dream was to come into an inheritance and\nto have a hundred thousand livres income for mistresses. He did\nnot belong, as the reader will perceive, to that puny variety of\noctogenaries who, like M. de Voltaire, have been dying all their life;\nhis was no longevity of a cracked pot; this jovial old man had always\nhad good health. He was superficial, rapid, easily angered. He flew into\na passion at everything, generally quite contrary to all reason. When\ncontradicted, he raised his cane; he beat people as he had done in the\ngreat century. He had a daughter over fifty years of age, and unmarried,\nwhom he chastised severely with his tongue, when in a rage, and whom he\nwould have liked to whip. She seemed to him to be eight years old. He\nboxed his servants' ears soundly, and said: \"Ah! carogne!\" One of his\noaths was: \"By the pantoufloche of the pantouflochade!\" He had singular\nfreaks of tranquillity; he had himself shaved every day by a barber who\nhad been mad and who detested him, being jealous of M. Gillenormand on\naccount of his wife, a pretty and coquettish barberess. M. Gillenormand\nadmired his own discernment in all things, and declared that he was\nextremely sagacious; here is one of his sayings: \"I have, in truth, some\npenetration; I am able to say when a flea bites me, from what woman it\ncame.\"\n\nThe words which he uttered the most frequently were: the sensible man,\nand nature. He did not give to this last word the grand acceptation\nwhich our epoch has accorded to it, but he made it enter, after his own\nfashion, into his little chimney-corner satires: \"Nature,\" he said, \"in\norder that civilization may have a little of everything, gives it even\nspecimens of its amusing barbarism. Europe possesses specimens of Asia\nand Africa on a small scale. The cat is a drawing-room tiger, the lizard\nis a pocket crocodile. The dancers at the opera are pink female savages.\nThey do not eat men, they crunch them; or, magicians that they are, they\ntransform them into oysters and swallow them. The Caribbeans leave only\nthe bones, they leave only the shell. Such are our morals. We do not\ndevour, we gnaw; we do not exterminate, we claw.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II--LIKE MASTER, LIKE HOUSE\n\nHe lived in the Marais, Rue des Filles-du-Calvaire, No. 6. He owned the\nhouse. This house has since been demolished and rebuilt, and the number\nhas probably been changed in those revolutions of numeration which the\nstreets of Paris undergo. He occupied an ancient and vast apartment\non the first floor, between street and gardens, furnished to the very\nceilings with great Gobelins and Beauvais tapestries representing\npastoral scenes; the subjects of the ceilings and the panels were\nrepeated in miniature on the arm-chairs. He enveloped his bed in a vast,\nnine-leaved screen of Coromandel lacquer. Long, full curtains hung from\nthe windows, and formed great, broken folds that were very magnificent.\nThe garden situated immediately under his windows was attached to that\none of them which formed the angle, by means of a staircase twelve or\nfifteen steps long, which the old gentleman ascended and descended with\ngreat agility. In addition to a library adjoining his chamber, he had a\nboudoir of which he thought a great deal, a gallant and elegant retreat,\nwith magnificent hangings of straw, with a pattern of flowers and\nfleurs-de-lys made on the galleys of Louis XIV. and ordered of his\nconvicts by M. de Vivonne for his mistress. M. Gillenormand had\ninherited it from a grim maternal great-aunt, who had died a\ncentenarian. He had had two wives. His manners were something between\nthose of the courtier, which he had never been, and the lawyer, which\nhe might have been. He was gay, and caressing when he had a mind. In\nhis youth he had been one of those men who are always deceived by their\nwives and never by their mistresses, because they are, at the same\ntime, the most sullen of husbands and the most charming of lovers in\nexistence. He was a connoisseur of painting. He had in his chamber a\nmarvellous portrait of no one knows whom, painted by Jordaens, executed\nwith great dashes of the brush, with millions of details, in a confused\nand hap-hazard manner. M. Gillenormand's attire was not the habit of\nLouis XIV. nor yet that of Louis XVI.; it was that of the Incroyables\nof the Directory. He had thought himself young up to that period and\nhad followed the fashions. His coat was of light-weight cloth with\nvoluminous revers, a long swallow-tail and large steel buttons. With\nthis he wore knee-breeches and buckle shoes. He always thrust his hands\ninto his fobs. He said authoritatively: \"The French Revolution is a heap\nof blackguards.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III--LUC-ESPRIT\n\nAt the age of sixteen, one evening at the opera, he had had the honor\nto be stared at through opera-glasses by two beauties at the same\ntime--ripe and celebrated beauties then, and sung by Voltaire, the\nCamargo and the Salle. Caught between two fires, he had beaten a heroic\nretreat towards a little dancer, a young girl named Nahenry, who was\nsixteen like himself, obscure as a cat, and with whom he was in love.\nHe abounded in memories. He was accustomed to exclaim: \"How pretty she\nwas--that Guimard-Guimardini-Guimardinette, the last time I saw her\nat Longchamps, her hair curled in sustained sentiments, with her\ncome-and-see of turquoises, her gown of the color of persons newly\narrived, and her little agitation muff!\" He had worn in his young\nmanhood a waistcoat of Nain-Londrin, which he was fond of talking about\neffusively. \"I was dressed like a Turk of the Levant Levantin,\" said he.\nMadame de Boufflers, having seen him by chance when he was twenty, had\ndescribed him as \"a charming fool.\" He was horrified by all the names\nwhich he saw in politics and in power, regarding them as vulgar and\nbourgeois. He read the journals, the newspapers, the gazettes as he\nsaid, stifling outbursts of laughter the while. \"Oh!\" he said, \"what\npeople these are! Corbiere! Humann! Casimir Perier! There's a minister\nfor you! I can imagine this in a journal: 'M. Gillenorman, minister!'\nthat would be a farce. Well! They are so stupid that it would pass\"; he\nmerrily called everything by its name, whether decent or indecent, and\ndid not restrain himself in the least before ladies. He uttered coarse\nspeeches, obscenities, and filth with a certain tranquillity and lack\nof astonishment which was elegant. It was in keeping with the\nunceremoniousness of his century. It is to be noted that the age of\nperiphrase in verse was the age of crudities in prose. His god-father\nhad predicted that he would turn out a man of genius, and had bestowed\non him these two significant names: Luc-Esprit.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV--A CENTENARIAN ASPIRANT\n\nHe had taken prizes in his boyhood at the College of Moulins, where he\nwas born, and he had been crowned by the hand of the Duc de Nivernais,\nwhom he called the Duc de Nevers. Neither the Convention, nor the death\nof Louis XVI., nor the Napoleon, nor the return of the Bourbons, nor\nanything else had been able to efface the memory of this crowning. The\nDuc de Nevers was, in his eyes, the great figure of the century. \"What a\ncharming grand seigneur,\" he said, \"and what a fine air he had with his\nblue ribbon!\"\n\nIn the eyes of M. Gillenormand, Catherine the Second had made reparation\nfor the crime of the partition of Poland by purchasing, for three\nthousand roubles, the secret of the elixir of gold, from Bestucheff. He\ngrew animated on this subject: \"The elixir of gold,\" he exclaimed, \"the\nyellow dye of Bestucheff, General Lamotte's drops, in the eighteenth\ncentury,--this was the great remedy for the catastrophes of love, the\npanacea against Venus, at one louis the half-ounce phial. Louis XV.\nsent two hundred phials of it to the Pope.\" He would have been greatly\nirritated and thrown off his balance, had any one told him that the\nelixir of gold is nothing but the perchloride of iron. M. Gillenormand\nadored the Bourbons, and had a horror of 1789; he was forever narrating\nin what manner he had saved himself during the Terror, and how he had\nbeen obliged to display a vast deal of gayety and cleverness in order to\nescape having his head cut off. If any young man ventured to pronounce\nan eulogium on the Republic in his presence, he turned purple and grew\nso angry that he was on the point of swooning. He sometimes alluded to\nhis ninety years, and said, \"I hope that I shall not see ninety-three\ntwice.\" On these occasions, he hinted to people that he meant to live to\nbe a hundred.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V--BASQUE AND NICOLETTE\n\nHe had theories. Here is one of them: \"When a man is passionately fond\nof women, and when he has himself a wife for whom he cares but little,\nwho is homely, cross, legitimate, with plenty of rights, perched on the\ncode, and jealous at need, there is but one way of extricating himself\nfrom the quandry and of procuring peace, and that is to let his wife\ncontrol the purse-strings. This abdication sets him free. Then his\nwife busies herself, grows passionately fond of handling coin, gets her\nfingers covered with verdigris in the process, undertakes the education\nof half-share tenants and the training of farmers, convokes lawyers,\npresides over notaries, harangues scriveners, visits limbs of the law,\nfollows lawsuits, draws up leases, dictates contracts, feels herself the\nsovereign, sells, buys, regulates, promises and compromises, binds fast\nand annuls, yields, concedes and retrocedes, arranges, disarranges,\nhoards, lavishes; she commits follies, a supreme and personal delight,\nand that consoles her. While her husband disdains her, she has the\nsatisfaction of ruining her husband.\" This theory M. Gillenormand had\nhimself applied, and it had become his history. His wife--the second\none--had administered his fortune in such a manner that, one fine day,\nwhen M. Gillenormand found himself a widower, there remained to him just\nsufficient to live on, by sinking nearly the whole of it in an annuity\nof fifteen thousand francs, three-quarters of which would expire with\nhim. He had not hesitated on this point, not being anxious to leave\na property behind him. Besides, he had noticed that patrimonies are\nsubject to adventures, and, for instance, become national property; he\nhad been present at the avatars of consolidated three per cents, and he\nhad no great faith in the Great Book of the Public Debt. \"All that's\nthe Rue Quincampois!\" he said. His house in the Rue Filles-du-Clavaire\nbelonged to him, as we have already stated. He had two servants, \"a male\nand a female.\" When a servant entered his establishment, M. Gillenormand\nre-baptized him. He bestowed on the men the name of their province:\nNimois, Comtois, Poitevin, Picard. His last valet was a big, foundered,\nshort-winded fellow of fifty-five, who was incapable of running twenty\npaces; but, as he had been born at Bayonne, M. Gillenormand called him\nBasque. All the female servants in his house were called Nicolette (even\nthe Magnon, of whom we shall hear more farther on). One day, a haughty\ncook, a cordon bleu, of the lofty race of porters, presented herself.\n\"How much wages do you want a month?\" asked M. Gillenormand. \"Thirty\nfrancs.\" \"What is your name?\" \"Olympie.\" \"You shall have fifty francs,\nand you shall be called Nicolette.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI--IN WHICH MAGNON AND HER TWO CHILDREN ARE SEEN\n\nWith M. Gillenormand, sorrow was converted into wrath; he was furious at\nbeing in despair. He had all sorts of prejudices and took all sorts\nof liberties. One of the facts of which his exterior relief and his\ninternal satisfaction was composed, was, as we have just hinted, that he\nhad remained a brisk spark, and that he passed energetically for such.\nThis he called having \"royal renown.\" This royal renown sometimes drew\ndown upon him singular windfalls. One day, there was brought to him in\na basket, as though it had been a basket of oysters, a stout, newly\nborn boy, who was yelling like the deuce, and duly wrapped in\nswaddling-clothes, which a servant-maid, dismissed six months\npreviously, attributed to him. M. Gillenormand had, at that time,\nfully completed his eighty-fourth year. Indignation and uproar in the\nestablishment. And whom did that bold hussy think she could persuade to\nbelieve that? What audacity! What an abominable calumny! M. Gillenormand\nhimself was not at all enraged. He gazed at the brat with the amiable\nsmile of a good man who is flattered by the calumny, and said in an\naside: \"Well, what now? What's the matter? You are finely taken aback,\nand really, you are excessively ignorant. M. le Duc d'Angouleme, the\nbastard of his Majesty Charles IX., married a silly jade of fifteen\nwhen he was eighty-five; M. Virginal, Marquis d'Alluye, brother to\nthe Cardinal de Sourdis, Archbishop of Bordeaux, had, at the age of\neighty-three, by the maid of Madame la Presidente Jacquin, a son, a\nreal child of love, who became a Chevalier of Malta and a counsellor of\nstate; one of the great men of this century, the Abbe Tabaraud, is the\nson of a man of eighty-seven. There is nothing out of the ordinary in\nthese things. And then, the Bible! Upon that I declare that this little\ngentleman is none of mine. Let him be taken care of. It is not his\nfault.\" This manner of procedure was good-tempered. The woman, whose\nname was Magnon, sent him another parcel in the following year. It was a\nboy again. Thereupon, M. Gillenormand capitulated. He sent the two brats\nback to their mother, promising to pay eighty francs a month for their\nmaintenance, on the condition that the said mother would not do so any\nmore. He added: \"I insist upon it that the mother shall treat them well.\nI shall go to see them from time to time.\" And this he did. He had had\na brother who was a priest, and who had been rector of the Academy of\nPoitiers for three and thirty years, and had died at seventy-nine.\n\"I lost him young,\" said he. This brother, of whom but little memory\nremains, was a peaceable miser, who, being a priest, thought himself\nbound to bestow alms on the poor whom he met, but he never gave them\nanything except bad or demonetized sous, thereby discovering a means of\ngoing to hell by way of paradise. As for M. Gillenormand the elder, he\nnever haggled over his alms-giving, but gave gladly and nobly. He was\nkindly, abrupt, charitable, and if he had been rich, his turn of mind\nwould have been magnificent. He desired that all which concerned him\nshould be done in a grand manner, even his rogueries. One day, having\nbeen cheated by a business man in a matter of inheritance, in a gross\nand apparent manner, he uttered this solemn exclamation: \"That was\nindecently done! I am really ashamed of this pilfering. Everything has\ndegenerated in this century, even the rascals. Morbleu! this is not the\nway to rob a man of my standing. I am robbed as though in a forest, but\nbadly robbed. Silva, sint consule dignae!\" He had had two wives, as\nwe have already mentioned; by the first he had had a daughter, who had\nremained unmarried, and by the second another daughter, who had died\nat about the age of thirty, who had wedded, through love, or chance,\nor otherwise, a soldier of fortune who had served in the armies of the\nRepublic and of the Empire, who had won the cross at Austerlitz and had\nbeen made colonel at Waterloo. \"He is the disgrace of my family,\"\nsaid the old bourgeois. He took an immense amount of snuff, and had a\nparticularly graceful manner of plucking at his lace ruffle with the\nback of one hand. He believed very little in God.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII--RULE: RECEIVE NO ONE EXCEPT IN THE EVENING\n\nSuch was M. Luc-Esprit Gillenormand, who had not lost his hair,--which\nwas gray rather than white,--and which was always dressed in \"dog's\nears.\" To sum up, he was venerable in spite of all this.\n\nHe had something of the eighteenth century about him; frivolous and\ngreat.\n\nIn 1814 and during the early years of the Restoration, M. Gillenormand,\nwho was still young,--he was only seventy-four,--lived in the Faubourg\nSaint Germain, Rue Servandoni, near Saint-Sulpice. He had only retired\nto the Marais when he quitted society, long after attaining the age of\neighty.\n\nAnd, on abandoning society, he had immured himself in his habits. The\nprincipal one, and that which was invariable, was to keep his door\nabsolutely closed during the day, and never to receive any one whatever\nexcept in the evening. He dined at five o'clock, and after that his door\nwas open. That had been the fashion of his century, and he would not\nswerve from it. \"The day is vulgar,\" said he, \"and deserves only a\nclosed shutter. Fashionable people only light up their minds when the\nzenith lights up its stars.\" And he barricaded himself against every\none, even had it been the king himself. This was the antiquated elegance\nof his day.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII--TWO DO NOT MAKE A PAIR\n\nWe have just spoken of M. Gillenormand's two daughters. They had come\ninto the world ten years apart. In their youth they had borne very\nlittle resemblance to each other, either in character or countenance,\nand had also been as little like sisters to each other as possible. The\nyoungest had a charming soul, which turned towards all that belongs to\nthe light, was occupied with flowers, with verses, with music, which\nfluttered away into glorious space, enthusiastic, ethereal, and was\nwedded from her very youth, in ideal, to a vague and heroic figure. The\nelder had also her chimera; she espied in the azure some very wealthy\npurveyor, a contractor, a splendidly stupid husband, a million made man,\nor even a prefect; the receptions of the Prefecture, an usher in the\nantechamber with a chain on his neck, official balls, the harangues\nof the town-hall, to be \"Madame la Prefete,\"--all this had created a\nwhirlwind in her imagination. Thus the two sisters strayed, each in her\nown dream, at the epoch when they were young girls. Both had wings, the\none like an angel, the other like a goose.\n\nNo ambition is ever fully realized, here below at least. No paradise\nbecomes terrestrial in our day. The younger wedded the man of her\ndreams, but she died. The elder did not marry at all.\n\nAt the moment when she makes her entrance into this history which we are\nrelating, she was an antique virtue, an incombustible prude, with one of\nthe sharpest noses, and one of the most obtuse minds that it is possible\nto see. A characteristic detail; outside of her immediate family, no one\nhad ever known her first name. She was called Mademoiselle Gillenormand,\nthe elder.\n\nIn the matter of cant, Mademoiselle Gillenormand could have given points\nto a miss. Her modesty was carried to the other extreme of blackness.\nShe cherished a frightful memory of her life; one day, a man had beheld\nher garter.\n\nAge had only served to accentuate this pitiless modesty. Her guimpe was\nnever sufficiently opaque, and never ascended sufficiently high. She\nmultiplied clasps and pins where no one would have dreamed of looking.\nThe peculiarity of prudery is to place all the more sentinels in\nproportion as the fortress is the less menaced.\n\nNevertheless, let him who can explain these antique mysteries of\ninnocence, she allowed an officer of the Lancers, her grand nephew,\nnamed Theodule, to embrace her without displeasure.\n\nIn spite of this favored Lancer, the label: Prude, under which we\nhave classed her, suited her to absolute perfection. Mademoiselle\nGillenormand was a sort of twilight soul. Prudery is a demi-virtue and a\ndemi-vice.\n\nTo prudery she added bigotry, a well-assorted lining. She belonged\nto the society of the Virgin, wore a white veil on certain festivals,\nmumbled special orisons, revered \"the holy blood,\" venerated \"the sacred\nheart,\" remained for hours in contemplation before a rococo-jesuit altar\nin a chapel which was inaccessible to the rank and file of the faithful,\nand there allowed her soul to soar among little clouds of marble, and\nthrough great rays of gilded wood.\n\nShe had a chapel friend, an ancient virgin like herself, named\nMademoiselle Vaubois, who was a positive blockhead, and beside whom\nMademoiselle Gillenormand had the pleasure of being an eagle. Beyond\nthe Agnus Dei and Ave Maria, Mademoiselle Vaubois had no knowledge of\nanything except of the different ways of making preserves. Mademoiselle\nVaubois, perfect in her style, was the ermine of stupidity without a\nsingle spot of intelligence.\n\nLet us say it plainly, Mademoiselle Gillenormand had gained rather than\nlost as she grew older. This is the case with passive natures. She had\nnever been malicious, which is relative kindness; and then, years wear\naway the angles, and the softening which comes with time had come to\nher. She was melancholy with an obscure sadness of which she did not\nherself know the secret. There breathed from her whole person the stupor\nof a life that was finished, and which had never had a beginning.\n\nShe kept house for her father. M. Gillenormand had his daughter near\nhim, as we have seen that Monseigneur Bienvenu had his sister with him.\nThese households comprised of an old man and an old spinster are not\nrare, and always have the touching aspect of two weaknesses leaning on\neach other for support.\n\nThere was also in this house, between this elderly spinster and this\nold man, a child, a little boy, who was always trembling and mute in the\npresence of M. Gillenormand. M. Gillenormand never addressed this child\nexcept in a severe voice, and sometimes, with uplifted cane: \"Here, sir!\nrascal, scoundrel, come here!--Answer me, you scamp! Just let me see\nyou, you good-for-nothing!\" etc., etc. He idolized him.\n\nThis was his grandson. We shall meet with this child again later on.\n\n\n\n\nBOOK THIRD.--THE GRANDFATHER AND THE GRANDSON\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I--AN ANCIENT SALON\n\nWhen M. Gillenormand lived in the Rue Servandoni, he had frequented\nmany very good and very aristocratic salons. Although a bourgeois, M.\nGillenormand was received in society. As he had a double measure of wit,\nin the first place, that which was born with him, and secondly, that\nwhich was attributed to him, he was even sought out and made much of. He\nnever went anywhere except on condition of being the chief person there.\nThere are people who will have influence at any price, and who will have\nother people busy themselves over them; when they cannot be oracles,\nthey turn wags. M. Gillenormand was not of this nature; his domination\nin the Royalist salons which he frequented cost his self-respect\nnothing. He was an oracle everywhere. It had happened to him to hold his\nown against M. de Bonald, and even against M. Bengy-Puy-Vallee.\n\nAbout 1817, he invariably passed two afternoons a week in a house in\nhis own neighborhood, in the Rue Ferou, with Madame la Baronne de T.,\na worthy and respectable person, whose husband had been Ambassador of\nFrance to Berlin under Louis XVI. Baron de T., who, during his lifetime,\nhad gone very passionately into ecstasies and magnetic visions, had died\nbankrupt, during the emigration, leaving, as his entire fortune,\nsome very curious Memoirs about Mesmer and his tub, in ten manuscript\nvolumes, bound in red morocco and gilded on the edges. Madame de T. had\nnot published the memoirs, out of pride, and maintained herself on a\nmeagre income which had survived no one knew how.\n\nMadame de T. lived far from the Court; \"a very mixed society,\" as she\nsaid, in a noble isolation, proud and poor. A few friends assembled\ntwice a week about her widowed hearth, and these constituted a purely\nRoyalist salon. They sipped tea there, and uttered groans or cries of\nhorror at the century, the charter, the Bonapartists, the prostitution\nof the blue ribbon, or the Jacobinism of Louis XVIII., according as the\nwind veered towards elegy or dithyrambs; and they spoke in low tones of\nthe hopes which were presented by Monsieur, afterwards Charles X.\n\nThe songs of the fishwomen, in which Napoleon was called Nicolas, were\nreceived there with transports of joy. Duchesses, the most delicate and\ncharming women in the world, went into ecstasies over couplets like the\nfollowing, addressed to \"the federates\":--\n\n               Refoncez dans vos culottes[20]\n               Le bout d' chemis' qui vous pend.\n               Qu'on n' dis' pas qu' les patriotes\n               Ont arbore l' drapeau blanc?\n\nThere they amused themselves with puns which were considered terrible,\nwith innocent plays upon words which they supposed to be venomous, with\nquatrains, with distiches even; thus, upon the Dessolles ministry, a\nmoderate cabinet, of which MM. Decazes and Deserre were members:--\n\n          Pour raffermir le trone ebranle sur sa base,[21]\n          Il faut changer de sol, et de serre et de case.\n\nOr they drew up a list of the chamber of peers, \"an abominably Jacobin\nchamber,\" and from this list they combined alliances of names, in such\na manner as to form, for example, phrases like the following: Damas.\nSabran. Gouvion-Saint-Cyr.--All this was done merrily. In that society,\nthey parodied the Revolution. They used I know not what desires to give\npoint to the same wrath in inverse sense. They sang their little Ca\nira:--\n\n               Ah! ca ira ca ira ca ira!\n               Les Bonapartistes a la lanterne!\n\nSongs are like the guillotine; they chop away indifferently, to-day this\nhead, to-morrow that. It is only a variation.\n\nIn the Fualdes affair, which belongs to this epoch, 1816, they took\npart for Bastide and Jausion, because Fualdes was \"a Buonapartist.\" They\ndesignated the liberals as friends and brothers; this constituted the\nmost deadly insult.\n\nLike certain church towers, Madame de T.'s salon had two cocks. One of\nthem was M. Gillenormand, the other was Comte de Lamothe-Valois, of whom\nit was whispered about, with a sort of respect: \"Do you know? That is\nthe Lamothe of the affair of the necklace.\" These singular amnesties do\noccur in parties.\n\nLet us add the following: in the bourgeoisie, honored situations decay\nthrough too easy relations; one must beware whom one admits; in the same\nway that there is a loss of caloric in the vicinity of those who are\ncold, there is a diminution of consideration in the approach of despised\npersons. The ancient society of the upper classes held themselves above\nthis law, as above every other. Marigny, the brother of the Pompadour,\nhad his entry with M. le Prince de Soubise. In spite of? No, because. Du\nBarry, the god-father of the Vaubernier, was very welcome at the house\nof M. le Marechal de Richelieu. This society is Olympus. Mercury and\nthe Prince de Guemenee are at home there. A thief is admitted there,\nprovided he be a god.\n\nThe Comte de Lamothe, who, in 1815, was an old man seventy-five years of\nage, had nothing remarkable about him except his silent and sententious\nair, his cold and angular face, his perfectly polished manners, his coat\nbuttoned up to his cravat, and his long legs always crossed in long,\nflabby trousers of the hue of burnt sienna. His face was the same color\nas his trousers.\n\nThis M. de Lamothe was \"held in consideration\" in this salon on account\nof his \"celebrity\" and, strange to say, though true, because of his name\nof Valois.\n\nAs for M. Gillenormand, his consideration was of absolutely first-rate\nquality. He had, in spite of his levity, and without its interfering in\nany way with his dignity, a certain manner about him which was imposing,\ndignified, honest, and lofty, in a bourgeois fashion; and his great\nage added to it. One is not a century with impunity. The years finally\nproduce around a head a venerable dishevelment.\n\nIn addition to this, he said things which had the genuine sparkle of the\nold rock. Thus, when the King of Prussia, after having restored Louis\nXVIII., came to pay the latter a visit under the name of the Count de\nRuppin, he was received by the descendant of Louis XIV. somewhat\nas though he had been the Marquis de Brandebourg, and with the most\ndelicate impertinence. M. Gillenormand approved: \"All kings who are\nnot the King of France,\" said he, \"are provincial kings.\" One day, the\nfollowing question was put and the following answer returned in his\npresence: \"To what was the editor of the Courrier Francais condemned?\"\n\"To be suspended.\" \"Sus is superfluous,\" observed M. Gillenormand.[22]\nRemarks of this nature found a situation.\n\nAt the Te Deum on the anniversary of the return of the Bourbons, he\nsaid, on seeing M. de Talleyrand pass by: \"There goes his Excellency the\nEvil One.\"\n\nM. Gillenormand was always accompanied by his daughter, that tall\nmademoiselle, who was over forty and looked fifty, and by a handsome\nlittle boy of seven years, white, rosy, fresh, with happy and trusting\neyes, who never appeared in that salon without hearing voices murmur\naround him: \"How handsome he is! What a pity! Poor child!\" This child\nwas the one of whom we dropped a word a while ago. He was called \"poor\nchild,\" because he had for a father \"a brigand of the Loire.\"\n\nThis brigand of the Loire was M. Gillenormand's son-in-law, who has\nalready been mentioned, and whom M. Gillenormand called \"the disgrace of\nhis family.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II--ONE OF THE RED SPECTRES OF THAT EPOCH\n\nAny one who had chanced to pass through the little town of Vernon at\nthis epoch, and who had happened to walk across that fine monumental\nbridge, which will soon be succeeded, let us hope, by some hideous iron\ncable bridge, might have observed, had he dropped his eyes over the\nparapet, a man about fifty years of age wearing a leather cap, and\ntrousers and a waistcoat of coarse gray cloth, to which something yellow\nwhich had been a red ribbon, was sewn, shod with wooden sabots, tanned\nby the sun, his face nearly black and his hair nearly white, a large\nscar on his forehead which ran down upon his cheek, bowed, bent,\nprematurely aged, who walked nearly every day, hoe and sickle in hand,\nin one of those compartments surrounded by walls which abut on the\nbridge, and border the left bank of the Seine like a chain of terraces,\ncharming enclosures full of flowers of which one could say, were they\nmuch larger: \"these are gardens,\" and were they a little smaller: \"these\nare bouquets.\" All these enclosures abut upon the river at one end, and\non a house at the other. The man in the waistcoat and the wooden shoes\nof whom we have just spoken, inhabited the smallest of these enclosures\nand the most humble of these houses about 1817. He lived there alone and\nsolitary, silently and poorly, with a woman who was neither young nor\nold, neither homely nor pretty, neither a peasant nor a bourgeoise, who\nserved him. The plot of earth which he called his garden was celebrated\nin the town for the beauty of the flowers which he cultivated there.\nThese flowers were his occupation.\n\nBy dint of labor, of perseverance, of attention, and of buckets of\nwater, he had succeeded in creating after the Creator, and he had\ninvented certain tulips and certain dahlias which seemed to have been\nforgotten by nature. He was ingenious; he had forestalled Soulange\nBodin in the formation of little clumps of earth of heath mould, for the\ncultivation of rare and precious shrubs from America and China. He\nwas in his alleys from the break of day, in summer, planting, cutting,\nhoeing, watering, walking amid his flowers with an air of kindness,\nsadness, and sweetness, sometimes standing motionless and thoughtful\nfor hours, listening to the song of a bird in the trees, the babble of a\nchild in a house, or with his eyes fixed on a drop of dew at the tip of\na spear of grass, of which the sun made a carbuncle. His table was very\nplain, and he drank more milk than wine. A child could make him give\nway, and his servant scolded him. He was so timid that he seemed shy, he\nrarely went out, and he saw no one but the poor people who tapped at his\npane and his cure, the Abbe Mabeuf, a good old man. Nevertheless, if the\ninhabitants of the town, or strangers, or any chance comers, curious to\nsee his tulips, rang at his little cottage, he opened his door with a\nsmile. He was the \"brigand of the Loire.\"\n\nAny one who had, at the same time, read military memoirs, biographies,\nthe Moniteur, and the bulletins of the grand army, would have been\nstruck by a name which occurs there with tolerable frequency, the name\nof Georges Pontmercy. When very young, this Georges Pontmercy had been\na soldier in Saintonge's regiment. The revolution broke out. Saintonge's\nregiment formed a part of the army of the Rhine; for the old regiments\nof the monarchy preserved their names of provinces even after the fall\nof the monarchy, and were only divided into brigades in 1794. Pontmercy\nfought at Spire, at Worms, at Neustadt, at Turkheim, at Alzey, at\nMayence, where he was one of the two hundred who formed Houchard's\nrearguard. It was the twelfth to hold its ground against the corps\nof the Prince of Hesse, behind the old rampart of Andernach, and only\nrejoined the main body of the army when the enemy's cannon had opened\na breach from the cord of the parapet to the foot of the glacis. He was\nunder Kleber at Marchiennes and at the battle of Mont-Palissel, where\na ball from a biscaien broke his arm. Then he passed to the frontier\nof Italy, and was one of the thirty grenadiers who defended the Col\nde Tende with Joubert. Joubert was appointed its adjutant-general, and\nPontmercy sub-lieutenant. Pontmercy was by Berthier's side in the midst\nof the grape-shot of that day at Lodi which caused Bonaparte to say:\n\"Berthier has been cannoneer, cavalier, and grenadier.\" He beheld his\nold general, Joubert, fall at Novi, at the moment when, with uplifted\nsabre, he was shouting: \"Forward!\" Having been embarked with his\ncompany in the exigencies of the campaign, on board a pinnace which was\nproceeding from Genoa to some obscure port on the coast, he fell into\na wasps'-nest of seven or eight English vessels. The Genoese commander\nwanted to throw his cannon into the sea, to hide the soldiers between\ndecks, and to slip along in the dark as a merchant vessel. Pontmercy had\nthe colors hoisted to the peak, and sailed proudly past under the guns\nof the British frigates. Twenty leagues further on, his audacity having\nincreased, he attacked with his pinnace, and captured a large English\ntransport which was carrying troops to Sicily, and which was so loaded\ndown with men and horses that the vessel was sunk to the level of the\nsea. In 1805 he was in that Malher division which took Gunzberg from the\nArchduke Ferdinand. At Weltingen he received into his arms, beneath a\nstorm of bullets, Colonel Maupetit, mortally wounded at the head of the\n9th Dragoons. He distinguished himself at Austerlitz in that admirable\nmarch in echelons effected under the enemy's fire. When the cavalry of\nthe Imperial Russian Guard crushed a battalion of the 4th of the line,\nPontmercy was one of those who took their revenge and overthrew the\nGuard. The Emperor gave him the cross. Pontmercy saw Wurmser at Mantua,\nMelas, and Alexandria, Mack at Ulm, made prisoners in succession.\nHe formed a part of the eighth corps of the grand army which Mortier\ncommanded, and which captured Hamburg. Then he was transferred to the\n55th of the line, which was the old regiment of Flanders. At Eylau\nhe was in the cemetery where, for the space of two hours, the heroic\nCaptain Louis Hugo, the uncle of the author of this book, sustained\nalone with his company of eighty-three men every effort of the hostile\narmy. Pontmercy was one of the three who emerged alive from that\ncemetery. He was at Friedland. Then he saw Moscow. Then La Beresina,\nthen Lutzen, Bautzen, Dresden, Wachau, Leipzig, and the defiles of\nGelenhausen; then Montmirail, Chateau-Thierry, Craon, the banks of the\nMarne, the banks of the Aisne, and the redoubtable position of Laon. At\nArnay-Le-Duc, being then a captain, he put ten Cossacks to the sword,\nand saved, not his general, but his corporal. He was well slashed up on\nthis occasion, and twenty-seven splinters were extracted from his left\narm alone. Eight days before the capitulation of Paris he had just\nexchanged with a comrade and entered the cavalry. He had what was called\nunder the old regime, the double hand, that is to say, an equal aptitude\nfor handling the sabre or the musket as a soldier, or a squadron or\na battalion as an officer. It is from this aptitude, perfected by a\nmilitary education, which certain special branches of the service arise,\nthe dragoons, for example, who are both cavalry-men and infantry at one\nand the same time. He accompanied Napoleon to the Island of Elba. At\nWaterloo, he was chief of a squadron of cuirassiers, in Dubois' brigade.\nIt was he who captured the standard of the Lunenburg battalion. He came\nand cast the flag at the Emperor's feet. He was covered with blood.\nWhile tearing down the banner he had received a sword-cut across his\nface. The Emperor, greatly pleased, shouted to him: \"You are a colonel,\nyou are a baron, you are an officer of the Legion of Honor!\" Pontmercy\nreplied: \"Sire, I thank you for my widow.\" An hour later, he fell in the\nravine of Ohain. Now, who was this Georges Pontmercy? He was this same\n\"brigand of the Loire.\"\n\nWe have already seen something of his history. After Waterloo,\nPontmercy, who had been pulled out of the hollow road of Ohain, as it\nwill be remembered, had succeeded in joining the army, and had dragged\nhimself from ambulance to ambulance as far as the cantonments of the\nLoire.\n\nThe Restoration had placed him on half-pay, then had sent him into\nresidence, that is to say, under surveillance, at Vernon. King Louis\nXVIII., regarding all that which had taken place during the Hundred\nDays as not having occurred at all, did not recognize his quality as an\nofficer of the Legion of Honor, nor his grade of colonel, nor his title\nof baron. He, on his side, neglected no occasion of signing himself\n\"Colonel Baron Pontmercy.\" He had only an old blue coat, and he never\nwent out without fastening to it his rosette as an officer of the Legion\nof Honor. The Attorney for the Crown had him warned that the authorities\nwould prosecute him for \"illegal\" wearing of this decoration. When this\nnotice was conveyed to him through an officious intermediary, Pontmercy\nretorted with a bitter smile: \"I do not know whether I no longer\nunderstand French, or whether you no longer speak it; but the fact is\nthat I do not understand.\" Then he went out for eight successive days\nwith his rosette. They dared not interfere with him. Two or three times\nthe Minister of War and the general in command of the department wrote\nto him with the following address: \"A Monsieur le Commandant Pontmercy.\"\nHe sent back the letters with the seals unbroken. At the same moment,\nNapoleon at Saint Helena was treating in the same fashion the missives\nof Sir Hudson Lowe addressed to General Bonaparte. Pontmercy had ended,\nmay we be pardoned the expression, by having in his mouth the same\nsaliva as his Emperor.\n\nIn the same way, there were at Rome Carthaginian prisoners who refused\nto salute Flaminius, and who had a little of Hannibal's spirit.\n\nOne day he encountered the district-attorney in one of the streets of\nVernon, stepped up to him, and said: \"Mr. Crown Attorney, am I permitted\nto wear my scar?\"\n\nHe had nothing save his meagre half-pay as chief of squadron. He had\nhired the smallest house which he could find at Vernon. He lived there\nalone, we have just seen how. Under the Empire, between two wars, he\nhad found time to marry Mademoiselle Gillenormand. The old bourgeois,\nthoroughly indignant at bottom, had given his consent with a sigh,\nsaying: \"The greatest families are forced into it.\" In 1815, Madame\nPontmercy, an admirable woman in every sense, by the way, lofty in\nsentiment and rare, and worthy of her husband, died, leaving a\nchild. This child had been the colonel's joy in his solitude; but the\ngrandfather had imperatively claimed his grandson, declaring that if\nthe child were not given to him he would disinherit him. The father had\nyielded in the little one's interest, and had transferred his love to\nflowers.\n\nMoreover, he had renounced everything, and neither stirred up mischief\nnor conspired. He shared his thoughts between the innocent things which\nhe was then doing and the great things which he had done. He passed his\ntime in expecting a pink or in recalling Austerlitz.\n\nM. Gillenormand kept up no relations with his son-in-law. The colonel\nwas \"a bandit\" to him. M. Gillenormand never mentioned the colonel,\nexcept when he occasionally made mocking allusions to \"his Baronship.\"\nIt had been expressly agreed that Pontmercy should never attempt to see\nhis son nor to speak to him, under penalty of having the latter handed\nover to him disowned and disinherited. For the Gillenormands, Pontmercy\nwas a man afflicted with the plague. They intended to bring up the\nchild in their own way. Perhaps the colonel was wrong to accept these\nconditions, but he submitted to them, thinking that he was doing right\nand sacrificing no one but himself.\n\nThe inheritance of Father Gillenormand did not amount to much; but the\ninheritance of Mademoiselle Gillenormand the elder was considerable.\nThis aunt, who had remained unmarried, was very rich on the maternal\nside, and her sister's son was her natural heir. The boy, whose name was\nMarius, knew that he had a father, but nothing more. No one opened\nhis mouth to him about it. Nevertheless, in the society into which his\ngrandfather took him, whispers, innuendoes, and winks, had eventually\nenlightened the little boy's mind; he had finally understood something\nof the case, and as he naturally took in the ideas and opinions which\nwere, so to speak, the air he breathed, by a sort of infiltration and\nslow penetration, he gradually came to think of his father only with\nshame and with a pain at his heart.\n\nWhile he was growing up in this fashion, the colonel slipped away every\ntwo or three months, came to Paris on the sly, like a criminal breaking\nhis ban, and went and posted himself at Saint-Sulpice, at the hour when\nAunt Gillenormand led Marius to the mass. There, trembling lest the aunt\nshould turn round, concealed behind a pillar, motionless, not daring to\nbreathe, he gazed at his child. The scarred veteran was afraid of that\nold spinster.\n\nFrom this had arisen his connection with the cure of Vernon, M. l'Abbe\nMabeuf.\n\nThat worthy priest was the brother of a warden of Saint-Sulpice, who had\noften observed this man gazing at his child, and the scar on his cheek,\nand the large tears in his eyes. That man, who had so manly an air, yet\nwho was weeping like a woman, had struck the warden. That face had clung\nto his mind. One day, having gone to Vernon to see his brother, he had\nencountered Colonel Pontmercy on the bridge, and had recognized the man\nof Saint-Sulpice. The warden had mentioned the circumstance to the cure,\nand both had paid the colonel a visit, on some pretext or other. This\nvisit led to others. The colonel, who had been extremely reserved at\nfirst, ended by opening his heart, and the cure and the warden finally\ncame to know the whole history, and how Pontmercy was sacrificing his\nhappiness to his child's future. This caused the cure to regard him with\nveneration and tenderness, and the colonel, on his side, became fond\nof the cure. And moreover, when both are sincere and good, no men so\npenetrate each other, and so amalgamate with each other, as an old\npriest and an old soldier. At bottom, the man is the same. The one has\ndevoted his life to his country here below, the other to his country on\nhigh; that is the only difference.\n\nTwice a year, on the first of January and on St. George's day, Marius\nwrote duty letters to his father, which were dictated by his aunt, and\nwhich one would have pronounced to be copied from some formula; this was\nall that M. Gillenormand tolerated; and the father answered them with\nvery tender letters which the grandfather thrust into his pocket unread.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III--REQUIESCANT\n\nMadame de T.'s salon was all that Marius Pontmercy knew of the world. It\nwas the only opening through which he could get a glimpse of life. This\nopening was sombre, and more cold than warmth, more night than day, came\nto him through this skylight. This child, who had been all joy and light\non entering this strange world, soon became melancholy, and, what is\nstill more contrary to his age, grave. Surrounded by all those singular\nand imposing personages, he gazed about him with serious amazement.\nEverything conspired to increase this astonishment in him. There were\nin Madame de T.'s salon some very noble ladies named Mathan, Noe,\nLevis,--which was pronounced Levi,--Cambis, pronounced Cambyse. These\nantique visages and these Biblical names mingled in the child's mind\nwith the Old Testament which he was learning by heart, and when they\nwere all there, seated in a circle around a dying fire, sparely lighted\nby a lamp shaded with green, with their severe profiles, their gray or\nwhite hair, their long gowns of another age, whose lugubrious colors\ncould not be distinguished, dropping, at rare intervals, words which\nwere both majestic and severe, little Marius stared at them with\nfrightened eyes, in the conviction that he beheld not women, but\npatriarchs and magi, not real beings, but phantoms.\n\nWith these phantoms, priests were sometimes mingled, frequenters of\nthis ancient salon, and some gentlemen; the Marquis de Sass****, private\nsecretary to Madame de Berry, the Vicomte de Val***, who published,\nunder the pseudonyme of Charles-Antoine, monorhymed odes, the Prince de\nBeauff*******, who, though very young, had a gray head and a pretty and\nwitty wife, whose very low-necked toilettes of scarlet velvet with gold\ntorsades alarmed these shadows, the Marquis de C*****d'E******, the man\nin all France who best understood \"proportioned politeness,\" the Comte\nd'Am*****, the kindly man with the amiable chin, and the Chevalier de\nPort-de-Guy, a pillar of the library of the Louvre, called the King's\ncabinet, M. de Port-de-Guy, bald, and rather aged than old, was wont\nto relate that in 1793, at the age of sixteen, he had been put in the\ngalleys as refractory and chained with an octogenarian, the Bishop\nof Mirepoix, also refractory, but as a priest, while he was so in the\ncapacity of a soldier. This was at Toulon. Their business was to go at\nnight and gather up on the scaffold the heads and bodies of the persons\nwho had been guillotined during the day; they bore away on their backs\nthese dripping corpses, and their red galley-slave blouses had a clot of\nblood at the back of the neck, which was dry in the morning and wet at\nnight. These tragic tales abounded in Madame de T.'s salon, and by\ndint of cursing Marat, they applauded Trestaillon. Some deputies of the\nundiscoverable variety played their whist there; M. Thibord du Chalard,\nM. Lemarchant de Gomicourt, and the celebrated scoffer of the right, M.\nCornet-Dincourt. The bailiff de Ferrette, with his short breeches\nand his thin legs, sometimes traversed this salon on his way to M. de\nTalleyrand. He had been M. le Comte d'Artois' companion in pleasures and\nunlike Aristotle crouching under Campaspe, he had made the Guimard crawl\non all fours, and in that way he had exhibited to the ages a philosopher\navenged by a bailiff. As for the priests, there was the Abbe Halma, the\nsame to whom M. Larose, his collaborator on la Foudre, said: \"Bah! Who\nis there who is not fifty years old? a few greenhorns perhaps?\" The Abbe\nLetourneur, preacher to the King, the Abbe Frayssinous, who was not, as\nyet, either count, or bishop, or minister, or peer, and who wore an old\ncassock whose buttons were missing, and the Abbe Keravenant, Cure of\nSaint-Germain-des-Pres; also the Pope's Nuncio, then Monsignor Macchi,\nArchbishop of Nisibi, later on Cardinal, remarkable for his long,\npensive nose, and another Monsignor, entitled thus: Abbate Palmieri,\ndomestic prelate, one of the seven participant prothonotaries of the\nHoly See, Canon of the illustrious Liberian basilica, Advocate of the\nsaints, Postulatore dei Santi, which refers to matters of canonization,\nand signifies very nearly: Master of Requests of the section of\nParadise. Lastly, two cardinals, M. de la Luzerne, and M. de Cl******\nT*******. The Cardinal of Luzerne was a writer and was destined to have,\na few years later, the honor of signing in the Conservateur articles\nside by side with Chateaubriand; M. de Cl****** T******* was Archbishop\nof Toul****, and often made trips to Paris, to his nephew, the Marquis\nde T*******, who was Minister of Marine and War. The Cardinal of\nCl****** T******* was a merry little man, who displayed his red\nstockings beneath his tucked-up cassock; his specialty was a hatred of\nthe Encyclopaedia, and his desperate play at billiards, and persons who,\nat that epoch, passed through the Rue M***** on summer evenings, where\nthe hotel de Cl****** T******* then stood, halted to listen to the shock\nof the balls and the piercing voice of the Cardinal shouting to his\nconclavist, Monseigneur Cotiret, Bishop in partibus of Caryste: \"Mark,\nAbbe, I make a cannon.\" The Cardinal de Cl****** T******* had been\nbrought to Madame de T.'s by his most intimate friend, M. de Roquelaure,\nformer Bishop of Senlis, and one of the Forty. M. de Roquelaure was\nnotable for his lofty figure and his assiduity at the Academy; through\nthe glass door of the neighboring hall of the library where the French\nAcademy then held its meetings, the curious could, on every Tuesday,\ncontemplate the Ex-Bishop of Senlis, usually standing erect, freshly\npowdered, in violet hose, with his back turned to the door, apparently\nfor the purpose of allowing a better view of his little collar. All\nthese ecclesiastics, though for the most part as much courtiers as\nchurchmen, added to the gravity of the T. salon, whose seigniorial\naspect was accentuated by five peers of France, the Marquis de Vib****,\nthe Marquis de Tal***, the Marquis de Herb*******, the Vicomte Damb***,\nand the Duc de Val********. This Duc de Val********, although Prince de\nMon***, that is to say a reigning prince abroad, had so high an idea of\nFrance and its peerage, that he viewed everything through their medium.\nIt was he who said: \"The Cardinals are the peers of France of Rome;\nthe lords are the peers of France of England.\" Moreover, as it is\nindispensable that the Revolution should be everywhere in this century,\nthis feudal salon was, as we have said, dominated by a bourgeois. M.\nGillenormand reigned there.\n\nThere lay the essence and quintessence of the Parisian white society.\nThere reputations, even Royalist reputations, were held in quarantine.\nThere is always a trace of anarchy in renown. Chateaubriand, had he\nentered there, would have produced the effect of Pere Duchene. Some of\nthe scoffed-at did, nevertheless, penetrate thither on sufferance. Comte\nBeug*** was received there, subject to correction.\n\nThe \"noble\" salons of the present day no longer resemble those salons.\nThe Faubourg Saint-Germain reeks of the fagot even now. The Royalists of\nto-day are demagogues, let us record it to their credit.\n\nAt Madame de T.'s the society was superior, taste was exquisite and\nhaughty, under the cover of a great show of politeness. Manners there\nadmitted of all sorts of involuntary refinements which were the old\nregime itself, buried but still alive. Some of these habits, especially\nin the matter of language, seem eccentric. Persons but superficially\nacquainted with them would have taken for provincial that which was only\nantique. A woman was called Madame la Generale. Madame la Colonelle was\nnot entirely disused. The charming Madame de Leon, in memory, no\ndoubt, of the Duchesses de Longueville and de Chevreuse, preferred this\nappellation to her title of Princesse. The Marquise de Crequy was also\ncalled Madame la Colonelle.\n\nIt was this little high society which invented at the Tuileries the\nrefinement of speaking to the King in private as the King, in the third\nperson, and never as Your Majesty, the designation of Your Majesty\nhaving been \"soiled by the usurper.\"\n\nMen and deeds were brought to judgment there. They jeered at the age,\nwhich released them from the necessity of understanding it. They abetted\neach other in amazement. They communicated to each other that modicum\nof light which they possessed. Methuselah bestowed information on\nEpimenides. The deaf man made the blind man acquainted with the course\nof things. They declared that the time which had elasped since Coblentz\nhad not existed. In the same manner that Louis XVIII. was by the grace\nof God, in the five and twentieth year of his reign, the emigrants were,\nby rights, in the five and twentieth year of their adolescence.\n\nAll was harmonious; nothing was too much alive; speech hardly amounted\nto a breath; the newspapers, agreeing with the salons, seemed a papyrus.\nThere were some young people, but they were rather dead. The liveries in\nthe antechamber were antiquated. These utterly obsolete personages were\nserved by domestics of the same stamp.\n\nThey all had the air of having lived a long time ago, and of obstinately\nresisting the sepulchre. Nearly the whole dictionary consisted of\nConserver, Conservation, Conservateur; to be in good odor,--that was the\npoint. There are, in fact, aromatics in the opinions of these venerable\ngroups, and their ideas smelled of it. It was a mummified society. The\nmasters were embalmed, the servants were stuffed with straw.\n\nA worthy old marquise, an emigree and ruined, who had but a solitary\nmaid, continued to say: \"My people.\"\n\nWhat did they do in Madame de T.'s salon? They were ultra.\n\nTo be ultra; this word, although what it represents may not have\ndisappeared, has no longer any meaning at the present day. Let us\nexplain it.\n\nTo be ultra is to go beyond. It is to attack the sceptre in the name of\nthe throne, and the mitre in the name of the attar; it is to ill-treat\nthe thing which one is dragging, it is to kick over the traces; it is\nto cavil at the fagot on the score of the amount of cooking received by\nheretics; it is to reproach the idol with its small amount of idolatry;\nit is to insult through excess of respect; it is to discover that the\nPope is not sufficiently papish, that the King is not sufficiently\nroyal, and that the night has too much light; it is to be discontented\nwith alabaster, with snow, with the swan and the lily in the name of\nwhiteness; it is to be a partisan of things to the point of becoming\ntheir enemy; it is to be so strongly for, as to be against.\n\nThe ultra spirit especially characterizes the first phase of the\nRestoration.\n\nNothing in history resembles that quarter of an hour which begins in\n1814 and terminates about 1820, with the advent of M. de Villele,\nthe practical man of the Right. These six years were an extraordinary\nmoment; at one and the same time brilliant and gloomy, smiling and\nsombre, illuminated as by the radiance of dawn and entirely covered, at\nthe same time, with the shadows of the great catastrophes which still\nfilled the horizon and were slowly sinking into the past. There existed\nin that light and that shadow, a complete little new and old world,\ncomic and sad, juvenile and senile, which was rubbing its eyes; nothing\nresembles an awakening like a return; a group which regarded France\nwith ill-temper, and which France regarded with irony; good old owls\nof marquises by the streetful, who had returned, and of ghosts, the\n\"former\" subjects of amazement at everything, brave and noble gentlemen\nwho smiled at being in France but wept also, delighted to behold\ntheir country once more, in despair at not finding their monarchy; the\nnobility of the Crusades treating the nobility of the Empire, that is to\nsay, the nobility of the sword, with scorn; historic races who had\nlost the sense of history; the sons of the companions of Charlemagne\ndisdaining the companions of Napoleon. The swords, as we have just\nremarked, returned the insult; the sword of Fontenoy was laughable and\nnothing but a scrap of rusty iron; the sword of Marengo was odious and\nwas only a sabre. Former days did not recognize Yesterday. People no\nlonger had the feeling for what was grand. There was some one who called\nBonaparte Scapin. This Society no longer exists. Nothing of it, we\nrepeat, exists to-day. When we select from it some one figure at random,\nand attempt to make it live again in thought, it seems as strange to us\nas the world before the Deluge. It is because it, too, as a matter of\nfact, has been engulfed in a deluge. It has disappeared beneath two\nRevolutions. What billows are ideas! How quickly they cover all that it\nis their mission to destroy and to bury, and how promptly they create\nfrightful gulfs!\n\nSuch was the physiognomy of the salons of those distant and candid times\nwhen M. Martainville had more wit than Voltaire.\n\nThese salons had a literature and politics of their own. They believed\nin Fievee. M. Agier laid down the law in them. They commentated M.\nColnet, the old bookseller and publicist of the Quay Malaquais. Napoleon\nwas to them thoroughly the Corsican Ogre. Later on the introduction into\nhistory of M. le Marquis de Bonaparte, Lieutenant-General of the King's\narmies, was a concession to the spirit of the age.\n\nThese salons did not long preserve their purity. Beginning with 1818,\ndoctrinarians began to spring up in them, a disturbing shade. Their way\nwas to be Royalists and to excuse themselves for being so. Where the\nultras were very proud, the doctrinarians were rather ashamed. They had\nwit; they had silence; their political dogma was suitably impregnated\nwith arrogance; they should have succeeded. They indulged, and usefully\ntoo, in excesses in the matter of white neckties and tightly buttoned\ncoats. The mistake or the misfortune of the doctrinarian party was to\ncreate aged youth. They assumed the poses of wise men. They dreamed of\nengrafting a temperate power on the absolute and excessive principle.\nThey opposed, and sometimes with rare intelligence, conservative\nliberalism to the liberalism which demolishes. They were heard to say:\n\"Thanks for Royalism! It has rendered more than one service. It has\nbrought back tradition, worship, religion, respect. It is faithful,\nbrave, chivalric, loving, devoted. It has mingled, though with regret,\nthe secular grandeurs of the monarchy with the new grandeurs of the\nnation. Its mistake is not to understand the Revolution, the Empire,\nglory, liberty, young ideas, young generations, the age. But this\nmistake which it makes with regard to us,--have we not sometimes been\nguilty of it towards them? The Revolution, whose heirs we are, ought to\nbe intelligent on all points. To attack Royalism is a misconstruction of\nliberalism. What an error! And what blindness! Revolutionary France is\nwanting in respect towards historic France, that is to say, towards its\nmother, that is to say, towards itself. After the 5th of September, the\nnobility of the monarchy is treated as the nobility of the Empire was\ntreated after the 5th of July. They were unjust to the eagle, we are\nunjust to the fleur-de-lys. It seems that we must always have something\nto proscribe! Does it serve any purpose to ungild the crown of Louis\nXIV., to scrape the coat of arms of Henry IV.? We scoff at M. de\nVaublanc for erasing the N's from the bridge of Jena! What was it that\nhe did? What are we doing? Bouvines belongs to us as well as Marengo.\nThe fleurs-de-lys are ours as well as the N's. That is our patrimony. To\nwhat purpose shall we diminish it? We must not deny our country in the\npast any more than in the present. Why not accept the whole of history?\nWhy not love the whole of France?\"\n\nIt is thus that doctrinarians criticised and protected Royalism, which\nwas displeased at criticism and furious at protection.\n\nThe ultras marked the first epoch of Royalism, congregation\ncharacterized the second. Skill follows ardor. Let us confine ourselves\nhere to this sketch.\n\nIn the course of this narrative, the author of this book has encountered\nin his path this curious moment of contemporary history; he has been\nforced to cast a passing glance upon it, and to trace once more some of\nthe singular features of this society which is unknown to-day. But he\ndoes it rapidly and without any bitter or derisive idea. Souvenirs both\nrespectful and affectionate, for they touch his mother, attach him to\nthis past. Moreover, let us remark, this same petty world had a grandeur\nof its own. One may smile at it, but one can neither despise nor hate\nit. It was the France of former days.\n\nMarius Pontmercy pursued some studies, as all children do. When he\nemerged from the hands of Aunt Gillenormand, his grandfather confided\nhim to a worthy professor of the most purely classic innocence. This\nyoung soul which was expanding passed from a prude to a vulgar pedant.\n\nMarius went through his years of college, then he entered the law\nschool. He was a Royalist, fanatical and severe. He did not love his\ngrandfather much, as the latter's gayety and cynicism repelled him, and\nhis feelings towards his father were gloomy.\n\nHe was, on the whole, a cold and ardent, noble, generous, proud,\nreligious, enthusiastic lad; dignified to harshness, pure to shyness.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV--END OF THE BRIGAND\n\nThe conclusion of Marius' classical studies coincided with M.\nGillenormand's departure from society. The old man bade farewell to\nthe Faubourg Saint-Germain and to Madame de T.'s salon, and established\nhimself in the Mardis, in his house of the Rue des Filles-du-Calvaire.\nThere he had for servants, in addition to the porter, that chambermaid,\nNicolette, who had succeeded to Magnon, and that short-breathed and\npursy Basque, who have been mentioned above.\n\nIn 1827, Marius had just attained his seventeenth year. One evening, on\nhis return home, he saw his grandfather holding a letter in his hand.\n\n\"Marius,\" said M. Gillenormand, \"you will set out for Vernon to-morrow.\"\n\n\"Why?\" said Marius.\n\n\"To see your father.\"\n\nMarius was seized with a trembling fit. He had thought of everything\nexcept this--that he should one day be called upon to see his father.\nNothing could be more unexpected, more surprising, and, let us admit\nit, more disagreeable to him. It was forcing estrangement into\nreconciliation. It was not an affliction, but it was an unpleasant duty.\n\nMarius, in addition to his motives of political antipathy, was convinced\nthat his father, the slasher, as M. Gillenormand called him on his\namiable days, did not love him; this was evident, since he had abandoned\nhim to others. Feeling that he was not beloved, he did not love.\n\"Nothing is more simple,\" he said to himself.\n\nHe was so astounded that he did not question M. Gillenormand. The\ngrandfather resumed:--\n\n\"It appears that he is ill. He demands your presence.\"\n\nAnd after a pause, he added:--\n\n\"Set out to-morrow morning. I think there is a coach which leaves the\nCour des Fontaines at six o'clock, and which arrives in the evening.\nTake it. He says that here is haste.\"\n\nThen he crushed the letter in his hand and thrust it into his pocket.\nMarius might have set out that very evening and have been with his\nfather on the following morning. A diligence from the Rue du Bouloi\ntook the trip to Rouen by night at that date, and passed through Vernon.\nNeither Marius nor M. Gillenormand thought of making inquiries about it.\n\nThe next day, at twilight, Marius reached Vernon. People were just\nbeginning to light their candles. He asked the first person whom he\nmet for \"M. Pontmercy's house.\" For in his own mind, he agreed with the\nRestoration, and like it, did not recognize his father's claim to the\ntitle of either colonel or baron.\n\nThe house was pointed out to him. He rang; a woman with a little lamp in\nher hand opened the door.\n\n\"M. Pontmercy?\" said Marius.\n\nThe woman remained motionless.\n\n\"Is this his house?\" demanded Marius.\n\nThe woman nodded affirmatively.\n\n\"Can I speak with him?\"\n\nThe woman shook her head.\n\n\"But I am his son!\" persisted Marius. \"He is expecting me.\"\n\n\"He no longer expects you,\" said the woman.\n\nThen he perceived that she was weeping.\n\nShe pointed to the door of a room on the ground-floor; he entered.\n\nIn that room, which was lighted by a tallow candle standing on the\nchimney-piece, there were three men, one standing erect, another\nkneeling, and one lying at full length, on the floor in his shirt. The\none on the floor was the colonel.\n\nThe other two were the doctor, and the priest, who was engaged in\nprayer.\n\nThe colonel had been attacked by brain fever three days previously. As\nhe had a foreboding of evil at the very beginning of his illness, he\nhad written to M. Gillenormand to demand his son. The malady had grown\nworse. On the very evening of Marius' arrival at Vernon, the colonel had\nhad an attack of delirium; he had risen from his bed, in spite of the\nservant's efforts to prevent him, crying: \"My son is not coming! I shall\ngo to meet him!\" Then he ran out of his room and fell prostrate on the\nfloor of the antechamber. He had just expired.\n\nThe doctor had been summoned, and the cure. The doctor had arrived too\nlate. The son had also arrived too late.\n\nBy the dim light of the candle, a large tear could be distinguished on\nthe pale and prostrate colonel's cheek, where it had trickled from his\ndead eye. The eye was extinguished, but the tear was not yet dry. That\ntear was his son's delay.\n\nMarius gazed upon that man whom he beheld for the first time, on that\nvenerable and manly face, on those open eyes which saw not, on those\nwhite locks, those robust limbs, on which, here and there, brown\nlines, marking sword-thrusts, and a sort of red stars, which indicated\nbullet-holes, were visible. He contemplated that gigantic sear which\nstamped heroism on that countenance upon which God had imprinted\ngoodness. He reflected that this man was his father, and that this man\nwas dead, and a chill ran over him.\n\nThe sorrow which he felt was the sorrow which he would have felt in the\npresence of any other man whom he had chanced to behold stretched out in\ndeath.\n\nAnguish, poignant anguish, was in that chamber. The servant-woman was\nlamenting in a corner, the cure was praying, and his sobs were audible,\nthe doctor was wiping his eyes; the corpse itself was weeping.\n\nThe doctor, the priest, and the woman gazed at Marius in the midst of\ntheir affliction without uttering a word; he was the stranger there.\nMarius, who was far too little affected, felt ashamed and embarrassed at\nhis own attitude; he held his hat in his hand; and he dropped it on the\nfloor, in order to produce the impression that grief had deprived him of\nthe strength to hold it.\n\nAt the same time, he experienced remorse, and he despised himself for\nbehaving in this manner. But was it his fault? He did not love his\nfather? Why should he!\n\nThe colonel had left nothing. The sale of big furniture barely paid the\nexpenses of his burial.\n\nThe servant found a scrap of paper, which she handed to Marius. It\ncontained the following, in the colonel's handwriting:--\n\n\"For my son.--The Emperor made me a Baron on the battle-field of\nWaterloo. Since the Restoration disputes my right to this title which I\npurchased with my blood, my son shall take it and bear it. That he will\nbe worthy of it is a matter of course.\" Below, the colonel had added:\n\"At that same battle of Waterloo, a sergeant saved my life. The man's\nname was Thenardier. I think that he has recently been keeping a\nlittle inn, in a village in the neighborhood of Paris, at Chelles or\nMontfermeil. If my son meets him, he will do all the good he can to\nThenardier.\"\n\nMarius took this paper and preserved it, not out of duty to his father,\nbut because of that vague respect for death which is always imperious in\nthe heart of man.\n\nNothing remained of the colonel. M. Gillenormand had his sword and\nuniform sold to an old-clothes dealer. The neighbors devastated the\ngarden and pillaged the rare flowers. The other plants turned to nettles\nand weeds, and died.\n\nMarius remained only forty-eight hours at Vernon. After the interment he\nreturned to Paris, and applied himself again to his law studies, with\nno more thought of his father than if the latter had never lived. In two\ndays the colonel was buried, and in three forgotten.\n\nMarius wore crape on his hat. That was all.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V--THE UTILITY OF GOING TO MASS, IN ORDER TO BECOME A\nREVOLUTIONIST\n\nMarius had preserved the religious habits of his childhood. One Sunday,\nwhen he went to hear mass at Saint-Sulpice, at that same chapel of the\nVirgin whither his aunt had led him when a small lad, he placed himself\nbehind a pillar, being more absent-minded and thoughtful than usual on\nthat occasion, and knelt down, without paying any special heed, upon a\nchair of Utrecht velvet, on the back of which was inscribed this name:\nMonsieur Mabeuf, warden. Mass had hardly begun when an old man presented\nhimself and said to Marius:--\n\n\"This is my place, sir.\"\n\nMarius stepped aside promptly, and the old man took possession of his\nchair.\n\nThe mass concluded, Marius still stood thoughtfully a few paces distant;\nthe old man approached him again and said:--\n\n\"I beg your pardon, sir, for having disturbed you a while ago, and for\nagain disturbing you at this moment; you must have thought me intrusive,\nand I will explain myself.\"\n\n\"There is no need of that, Sir,\" said Marius.\n\n\"Yes!\" went on the old man, \"I do not wish you to have a bad opinion of\nme. You see, I am attached to this place. It seems to me that the mass\nis better from here. Why? I will tell you. It is from this place, that\nI have watched a poor, brave father come regularly, every two or three\nmonths, for the last ten years, since he had no other opportunity and\nno other way of seeing his child, because he was prevented by family\narrangements. He came at the hour when he knew that his son would be\nbrought to mass. The little one never suspected that his father was\nthere. Perhaps he did not even know that he had a father, poor innocent!\nThe father kept behind a pillar, so that he might not be seen. He gazed\nat his child and he wept. He adored that little fellow, poor man! I\ncould see that. This spot has become sanctified in my sight, and I have\ncontracted a habit of coming hither to listen to the mass. I prefer it\nto the stall to which I have a right, in my capacity of warden. I knew\nthat unhappy gentleman a little, too. He had a father-in-law, a wealthy\naunt, relatives, I don't know exactly what all, who threatened to\ndisinherit the child if he, the father, saw him. He sacrificed himself\nin order that his son might be rich and happy some day. He was separated\nfrom him because of political opinions. Certainly, I approve of\npolitical opinions, but there are people who do not know where to stop.\nMon Dieu! a man is not a monster because he was at Waterloo; a father\nis not separated from his child for such a reason as that. He was one of\nBonaparte's colonels. He is dead, I believe. He lived at Vernon, where I\nhave a brother who is a cure, and his name was something like Pontmarie\nor Montpercy. He had a fine sword-cut, on my honor.\"\n\n\"Pontmercy,\" suggested Marius, turning pale.\n\n\"Precisely, Pontmercy. Did you know him?\"\n\n\"Sir,\" said Marius, \"he was my father.\"\n\nThe old warden clasped his hands and exclaimed:--\n\n\"Ah! you are the child! Yes, that's true, he must be a man by this\ntime. Well! poor child, you may say that you had a father who loved you\ndearly!\"\n\nMarius offered his arm to the old man and conducted him to his lodgings.\n\nOn the following day, he said to M. Gillenormand:--\n\n\"I have arranged a hunting-party with some friends. Will you permit me\nto be absent for three days?\"\n\n\"Four!\" replied his grandfather. \"Go and amuse yourself.\"\n\nAnd he said to his daughter in a low tone, and with a wink, \"Some love\naffair!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI--THE CONSEQUENCES OF HAVING MET A WARDEN\n\nWhere it was that Marius went will be disclosed a little further on.\n\nMarius was absent for three days, then he returned to Paris, went\nstraight to the library of the law-school and asked for the files of the\nMoniteur.\n\nHe read the Moniteur, he read all the histories of the Republic and\nthe Empire, the Memorial de Sainte-Helene, all the memoirs, all the\nnewspapers, the bulletins, the proclamations; he devoured everything.\nThe first time that he came across his father's name in the bulletins of\nthe grand army, he had a fever for a week. He went to see the generals\nunder whom Georges Pontmercy had served, among others, Comte H.\nChurch-warden Mabeuf, whom he went to see again, told him about the life\nat Vernon, the colonel's retreat, his flowers, his solitude. Marius came\nto a full knowledge of that rare, sweet, and sublime man, that species\nof lion-lamb who had been his father.\n\nIn the meanwhile, occupied as he was with this study which absorbed all\nhis moments as well as his thoughts, he hardly saw the Gillenormands at\nall. He made his appearance at meals; then they searched for him, and he\nwas not to be found. Father Gillenormand smiled. \"Bah! bah! He is just\nof the age for the girls!\" Sometimes the old man added: \"The deuce!\nI thought it was only an affair of gallantry, It seems that it is an\naffair of passion!\"\n\nIt was a passion, in fact. Marius was on the high road to adoring his\nfather.\n\nAt the same time, his ideas underwent an extraordinary change. The\nphases of this change were numerous and successive. As this is the\nhistory of many minds of our day, we think it will prove useful to\nfollow these phases step by step and to indicate them all.\n\nThat history upon which he had just cast his eyes appalled him.\n\nThe first effect was to dazzle him.\n\nUp to that time, the Republic, the Empire, had been to him only\nmonstrous words. The Republic, a guillotine in the twilight; the Empire,\na sword in the night. He had just taken a look at it, and where he had\nexpected to find only a chaos of shadows, he had beheld, with a sort\nof unprecedented surprise, mingled with fear and joy, stars sparkling,\nMirabeau, Vergniaud, Saint-Just, Robespierre, Camille, Desmoulins,\nDanton, and a sun arise, Napoleon. He did not know where he stood. He\nrecoiled, blinded by the brilliant lights. Little by little, when his\nastonishment had passed off, he grew accustomed to this radiance, he\ncontemplated these deeds without dizziness, he examined these personages\nwithout terror; the Revolution and the Empire presented themselves\nluminously, in perspective, before his mind's eye; he beheld each of\nthese groups of events and of men summed up in two tremendous facts: the\nRepublic in the sovereignty of civil right restored to the masses,\nthe Empire in the sovereignty of the French idea imposed on Europe; he\nbeheld the grand figure of the people emerge from the Revolution, and\nthe grand figure of France spring forth from the Empire. He asserted\nin his conscience, that all this had been good. What his dazzled state\nneglected in this, his first far too synthetic estimation, we do not\nthink it necessary to point out here. It is the state of a mind on the\nmarch that we are recording. Progress is not accomplished in one stage.\nThat stated, once for all, in connection with what precedes as well as\nwith what is to follow, we continue.\n\nHe then perceived that, up to that moment, he had comprehended his\ncountry no more than he had comprehended his father. He had not known\neither the one or the other, and a sort of voluntary night had obscured\nhis eyes. Now he saw, and on the one hand he admired, while on the other\nhe adored.\n\nHe was filled with regret and remorse, and he reflected in despair that\nall he had in his soul could now be said only to the tomb. Oh! if his\nfather had still been in existence, if he had still had him, if God, in\nhis compassion and his goodness, had permitted his father to be still\namong the living, how he would have run, how he would have precipitated\nhimself, how he would have cried to his father: \"Father! Here I am! It\nis I! I have the same heart as thou! I am thy son!\" How he would have\nembraced that white head, bathed his hair in tears, gazed upon his scar,\npressed his hands, adored his garment, kissed his feet! Oh! Why had his\nfather died so early, before his time, before the justice, the love of\nhis son had come to him? Marius had a continual sob in his heart, which\nsaid to him every moment: \"Alas!\" At the same time, he became more truly\nserious, more truly grave, more sure of his thought and his faith. At\neach instant, gleams of the true came to complete his reason. An inward\ngrowth seemed to be in progress within him. He was conscious of a sort\nof natural enlargement, which gave him two things that were new to\nhim--his father and his country.\n\nAs everything opens when one has a key, so he explained to himself that\nwhich he had hated, he penetrated that which he had abhorred; henceforth\nhe plainly perceived the providential, divine and human sense of the\ngreat things which he had been taught to detest, and of the great men\nwhom he had been instructed to curse. When he reflected on his former\nopinions, which were but those of yesterday, and which, nevertheless,\nseemed to him already so very ancient, he grew indignant, yet he smiled.\n\nFrom the rehabilitation of his father, he naturally passed to the\nrehabilitation of Napoleon.\n\nBut the latter, we will confess, was not effected without labor.\n\nFrom his infancy, he had been imbued with the judgments of the party of\n1814, on Bonaparte. Now, all the prejudices of the Restoration, all its\ninterests, all its instincts tended to disfigure Napoleon. It execrated\nhim even more than it did Robespierre. It had very cleverly turned to\nsufficiently good account the fatigue of the nation, and the hatred of\nmothers. Bonaparte had become an almost fabulous monster, and in order\nto paint him to the imagination of the people, which, as we lately\npointed out, resembles the imagination of children, the party of 1814\nmade him appear under all sorts of terrifying masks in succession, from\nthat which is terrible though it remains grandiose to that which is\nterrible and becomes grotesque, from Tiberius to the bugaboo. Thus, in\nspeaking of Bonaparte, one was free to sob or to puff up with\nlaughter, provided that hatred lay at the bottom. Marius had never\nentertained--about that man, as he was called--any other ideas in his\nmind. They had combined with the tenacity which existed in his nature.\nThere was in him a headstrong little man who hated Napoleon.\n\nOn reading history, on studying him, especially in the documents and\nmaterials for history, the veil which concealed Napoleon from the eyes\nof Marius was gradually rent. He caught a glimpse of something immense,\nand he suspected that he had been deceived up to that moment, on\nthe score of Bonaparte as about all the rest; each day he saw more\ndistinctly; and he set about mounting, slowly, step by step, almost\nregretfully in the beginning, then with intoxication and as though\nattracted by an irresistible fascination, first the sombre steps, then\nthe vaguely illuminated steps, at last the luminous and splendid steps\nof enthusiasm.\n\nOne night, he was alone in his little chamber near the roof. His candle\nwas burning; he was reading, with his elbows resting on his table close\nto the open window. All sorts of reveries reached him from space, and\nmingled with his thoughts. What a spectacle is the night! One hears dull\nsounds, without knowing whence they proceed; one beholds Jupiter, which\nis twelve hundred times larger than the earth, glowing like a firebrand,\nthe azure is black, the stars shine; it is formidable.\n\nHe was perusing the bulletins of the grand army, those heroic strophes\npenned on the field of battle; there, at intervals, he beheld his\nfather's name, always the name of the Emperor; the whole of that great\nEmpire presented itself to him; he felt a flood swelling and rising\nwithin him; it seemed to him at moments that his father passed close\nto him like a breath, and whispered in his ear; he gradually got into\na singular state; he thought that he heard drums, cannon, trumpets,\nthe measured tread of battalions, the dull and distant gallop of the\ncavalry; from time to time, his eyes were raised heavenward, and gazed\nupon the colossal constellations as they gleamed in the measureless\ndepths of space, then they fell upon his book once more, and there they\nbeheld other colossal things moving confusedly. His heart contracted\nwithin him. He was in a transport, trembling, panting. All at once,\nwithout himself knowing what was in him, and what impulse he was\nobeying, he sprang to his feet, stretched both arms out of the window,\ngazed intently into the gloom, the silence, the infinite darkness, the\neternal immensity, and exclaimed: \"Long live the Emperor!\"\n\nFrom that moment forth, all was over; the Ogre of Corsica,--the\nusurper,--the tyrant,--the monster who was the lover of his own\nsisters,--the actor who took lessons of Talma,--the poisoner of\nJaffa,--the tiger,--Buonaparte,--all this vanished, and gave place\nin his mind to a vague and brilliant radiance in which shone, at an\ninaccessible height, the pale marble phantom of Caesar. The Emperor had\nbeen for his father only the well-beloved captain whom one admires, for\nwhom one sacrifices one's self; he was something more to Marius. He was\nthe predestined constructor of the French group, succeeding the Roman\ngroup in the domination of the universe. He was a prodigious architect,\nof a destruction, the continuer of Charlemagne, of Louis XI., of Henry\nIV., of Richelieu, of Louis XIV., and of the Committee of Public Safety,\nhaving his spots, no doubt, his faults, his crimes even, being a man,\nthat is to say; but august in his faults, brilliant in his spots,\npowerful in his crime.\n\nHe was the predestined man, who had forced all nations to say: \"The\ngreat nation!\" He was better than that, he was the very incarnation of\nFrance, conquering Europe by the sword which he grasped, and the world\nby the light which he shed. Marius saw in Bonaparte the dazzling spectre\nwhich will always rise upon the frontier, and which will guard the\nfuture. Despot but dictator; a despot resulting from a republic and\nsumming up a revolution. Napoleon became for him the man-people as Jesus\nChrist is the man-God.\n\nIt will be perceived, that like all new converts to a religion, his\nconversion intoxicated him, he hurled himself headlong into adhesion\nand he went too far. His nature was so constructed; once on the downward\nslope, it was almost impossible for him to put on the drag. Fanaticism\nfor the sword took possession of him, and complicated in his mind his\nenthusiasm for the idea. He did not perceive that, along with genius,\nand pell-mell, he was admitting force, that is to say, that he was\ninstalling in two compartments of his idolatry, on the one hand that\nwhich is divine, on the other that which is brutal. In many respects, he\nhad set about deceiving himself otherwise. He admitted everything. There\nis a way of encountering error while on one's way to the truth. He had a\nviolent sort of good faith which took everything in the lump. In the new\npath which he had entered on, in judging the mistakes of the old regime,\nas in measuring the glory of Napoleon, he neglected the attenuating\ncircumstances.\n\nAt all events, a tremendous step had been taken. Where he had formerly\nbeheld the fall of the monarchy, he now saw the advent of France. His\norientation had changed. What had been his East became the West. He had\nturned squarely round.\n\nAll these revolutions were accomplished within him, without his family\nobtaining an inkling of the case.\n\nWhen, during this mysterious labor, he had entirely shed his old Bourbon\nand ultra skin, when he had cast off the aristocrat, the Jacobite and\nthe Royalist, when he had become thoroughly a revolutionist, profoundly\ndemocratic and republican, he went to an engraver on the Quai des\nOrfevres and ordered a hundred cards bearing this name: Le Baron Marius\nPontmercy.\n\nThis was only the strictly logical consequence of the change which had\ntaken place in him, a change in which everything gravitated round his\nfather.\n\nOnly, as he did not know any one and could not sow his cards with any\nporter, he put them in his pocket.\n\nBy another natural consequence, in proportion as he drew nearer to his\nfather, to the latter's memory, and to the things for which the\ncolonel had fought five and twenty years before, he receded from his\ngrandfather. We have long ago said, that M. Gillenormand's temper did\nnot please him. There already existed between them all the dissonances\nof the grave young man and the frivolous old man. The gayety of Geronte\nshocks and exasperates the melancholy of Werther. So long as the same\npolitical opinions and the same ideas had been common to them both,\nMarius had met M. Gillenormand there as on a bridge. When the bridge\nfell, an abyss was formed. And then, over and above all, Marius\nexperienced unutterable impulses to revolt, when he reflected that it\nwas M. Gillenormand who had, from stupid motives, torn him ruthlessly\nfrom the colonel, thus depriving the father of the child, and the child\nof the father.\n\nBy dint of pity for his father, Marius had nearly arrived at aversion\nfor his grandfather.\n\nNothing of this sort, however, was betrayed on the exterior, as we have\nalready said. Only he grew colder and colder; laconic at meals, and rare\nin the house. When his aunt scolded him for it, he was very gentle and\nalleged his studies, his lectures, the examinations, etc., as a pretext.\nHis grandfather never departed from his infallible diagnosis: \"In love!\nI know all about it.\"\n\nFrom time to time Marius absented himself.\n\n\"Where is it that he goes off like this?\" said his aunt.\n\nOn one of these trips, which were always very brief, he went to\nMontfermeil, in order to obey the injunction which his father had\nleft him, and he sought the old sergeant to Waterloo, the inn-keeper\nThenardier. Thenardier had failed, the inn was closed, and no one knew\nwhat had become of him. Marius was away from the house for four days on\nthis quest.\n\n\"He is getting decidedly wild,\" said his grandfather.\n\nThey thought they had noticed that he wore something on his breast,\nunder his shirt, which was attached to his neck by a black ribbon.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII--SOME PETTICOAT\n\nWe have mentioned a lancer.\n\nHe was a great-grand-nephew of M. Gillenormand, on the paternal side,\nwho led a garrison life, outside the family and far from the domestic\nhearth. Lieutenant Theodule Gillenormand fulfilled all the conditions\nrequired to make what is called a fine officer. He had \"a lady's waist,\"\na victorious manner of trailing his sword and of twirling his mustache\nin a hook. He visited Paris very rarely, and so rarely that Marius had\nnever seen him. The cousins knew each other only by name. We think\nwe have said that Theodule was the favorite of Aunt Gillenormand, who\npreferred him because she did not see him. Not seeing people permits one\nto attribute to them all possible perfections.\n\nOne morning, Mademoiselle Gillenormand the elder returned to her\napartment as much disturbed as her placidity was capable of allowing.\nMarius had just asked his grandfather's permission to take a little\ntrip, adding that he meant to set out that very evening. \"Go!\" had been\nhis grandfather's reply, and M. Gillenormand had added in an aside, as\nhe raised his eyebrows to the top of his forehead: \"Here he is passing\nthe night out again.\" Mademoiselle Gillenormand had ascended to\nher chamber greatly puzzled, and on the staircase had dropped this\nexclamation: \"This is too much!\"--and this interrogation: \"But where is\nit that he goes?\" She espied some adventure of the heart, more or less\nillicit, a woman in the shadow, a rendezvous, a mystery, and she would\nnot have been sorry to thrust her spectacles into the affair. Tasting a\nmystery resembles getting the first flavor of a scandal; sainted souls\ndo not detest this. There is some curiosity about scandal in the secret\ncompartments of bigotry.\n\nSo she was the prey of a vague appetite for learning a history.\n\nIn order to get rid of this curiosity which agitated her a little beyond\nher wont, she took refuge in her talents, and set about scalloping,\nwith one layer of cotton after another, one of those embroideries of the\nEmpire and the Restoration, in which there are numerous cart-wheels.\nThe work was clumsy, the worker cross. She had been seated at this for\nseveral hours when the door opened. Mademoiselle Gillenormand raised\nher nose. Lieutenant Theodule stood before her, making the regulation\nsalute. She uttered a cry of delight. One may be old, one may be a\nprude, one may be pious, one may be an aunt, but it is always agreeable\nto see a lancer enter one's chamber.\n\n\"You here, Theodule!\" she exclaimed.\n\n\"On my way through town, aunt.\"\n\n\"Embrace me.\"\n\n\"Here goes!\" said Theodule.\n\nAnd he kissed her. Aunt Gillenormand went to her writing-desk and opened\nit.\n\n\"You will remain with us a week at least?\"\n\n\"I leave this very evening, aunt.\"\n\n\"It is not possible!\"\n\n\"Mathematically!\"\n\n\"Remain, my little Theodule, I beseech you.\"\n\n\"My heart says 'yes,' but my orders say 'no.' The matter is simple.\nThey are changing our garrison; we have been at Melun, we are being\ntransferred to Gaillon. It is necessary to pass through Paris in order\nto get from the old post to the new one. I said: 'I am going to see my\naunt.'\"\n\n\"Here is something for your trouble.\"\n\nAnd she put ten louis into his hand.\n\n\"For my pleasure, you mean to say, my dear aunt.\"\n\nTheodule kissed her again, and she experienced the joy of having some of\nthe skin scratched from her neck by the braidings on his uniform.\n\n\"Are you making the journey on horseback, with your regiment?\" she asked\nhim.\n\n\"No, aunt. I wanted to see you. I have special permission. My servant is\ntaking my horse; I am travelling by diligence. And, by the way, I want\nto ask you something.\"\n\n\"What is it?\"\n\n\"Is my cousin Marius Pontmercy travelling so, too?\"\n\n\"How do you know that?\" said his aunt, suddenly pricked to the quick\nwith a lively curiosity.\n\n\"On my arrival, I went to the diligence to engage my seat in the coupe.\"\n\n\"Well?\"\n\n\"A traveller had already come to engage a seat in the imperial. I saw\nhis name on the card.\"\n\n\"What name?\"\n\n\"Marius Pontmercy.\"\n\n\"The wicked fellow!\" exclaimed his aunt. \"Ah! your cousin is not a\nsteady lad like yourself. To think that he is to pass the night in a\ndiligence!\"\n\n\"Just as I am going to do.\"\n\n\"But you--it is your duty; in his case, it is wildness.\"\n\n\"Bosh!\" said Theodule.\n\nHere an event occurred to Mademoiselle Gillenormand the elder,--an idea\nstruck her. If she had been a man, she would have slapped her brow. She\napostrophized Theodule:--\n\n\"Are you aware whether your cousin knows you?\"\n\n\"No. I have seen him; but he has never deigned to notice me.\"\n\n\"So you are going to travel together?\"\n\n\"He in the imperial, I in the coupe.\"\n\n\"Where does this diligence run?\"\n\n\"To Andelys.\"\n\n\"Then that is where Marius is going?\"\n\n\"Unless, like myself, he should stop on the way. I get down at Vernon,\nin order to take the branch coach for Gaillon. I know nothing of Marius'\nplan of travel.\"\n\n\"Marius! what an ugly name! what possessed them to name him Marius?\nWhile you, at least, are called Theodule.\"\n\n\"I would rather be called Alfred,\" said the officer.\n\n\"Listen, Theodule.\"\n\n\"I am listening, aunt.\"\n\n\"Pay attention.\"\n\n\"I am paying attention.\"\n\n\"You understand?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Well, Marius absents himself!\"\n\n\"Eh! eh!\"\n\n\"He travels.\"\n\n\"Ah! ah!\"\n\n\"He spends the night out.\"\n\n\"Oh! oh!\"\n\n\"We should like to know what there is behind all this.\"\n\nTheodule replied with the composure of a man of bronze:--\n\n\"Some petticoat or other.\"\n\nAnd with that inward laugh which denotes certainty, he added:--\n\n\"A lass.\"\n\n\"That is evident,\" exclaimed his aunt, who thought she heard M.\nGillenormand speaking, and who felt her conviction become irresistible\nat that word fillette, accentuated in almost the very same fashion by\nthe granduncle and the grandnephew. She resumed:--\n\n\"Do us a favor. Follow Marius a little. He does not know you, it will be\neasy. Since a lass there is, try to get a sight of her. You must write\nus the tale. It will amuse his grandfather.\"\n\nTheodule had no excessive taste for this sort of spying; but he was much\ntouched by the ten louis, and he thought he saw a chance for a possible\nsequel. He accepted the commission and said: \"As you please, aunt.\"\n\nAnd he added in an aside, to himself: \"Here I am a duenna.\"\n\nMademoiselle Gillenormand embraced him.\n\n\"You are not the man to play such pranks, Theodule. You obey discipline,\nyou are the slave of orders, you are a man of scruples and duty, and you\nwould not quit your family to go and see a creature.\"\n\nThe lancer made the pleased grimace of Cartouche when praised for his\nprobity.\n\nMarius, on the evening following this dialogue, mounted the diligence\nwithout suspecting that he was watched. As for the watcher, the\nfirst thing he did was to fall asleep. His slumber was complete and\nconscientious. Argus snored all night long.\n\nAt daybreak, the conductor of the diligence shouted: \"Vernon! relay of\nVernon! Travellers for Vernon!\" And Lieutenant Theodule woke.\n\n\"Good,\" he growled, still half asleep, \"this is where I get out.\"\n\nThen, as his memory cleared by degrees, the effect of waking, he\nrecalled his aunt, the ten louis, and the account which he had\nundertaken to render of the deeds and proceedings of Marius. This set\nhim to laughing.\n\n\"Perhaps he is no longer in the coach,\" he thought, as he rebuttoned the\nwaistcoat of his undress uniform. \"He may have stopped at Poissy; he may\nhave stopped at Triel; if he did not get out at Meulan, he may have got\nout at Mantes, unless he got out at Rolleboise, or if he did not go on\nas far as Pacy, with the choice of turning to the left at Evreus, or to\nthe right at Laroche-Guyon. Run after him, aunty. What the devil am I to\nwrite to that good old soul?\"\n\nAt that moment a pair of black trousers descending from the imperial,\nmade its appearance at the window of the coupe.\n\n\"Can that be Marius?\" said the lieutenant.\n\nIt was Marius.\n\nA little peasant girl, all entangled with the horses and the postilions\nat the end of the vehicle, was offering flowers to the travellers. \"Give\nyour ladies flowers!\" she cried.\n\nMarius approached her and purchased the finest flowers in her flat\nbasket.\n\n\"Come now,\" said Theodule, leaping down from the coupe, \"this piques my\ncuriosity. Who the deuce is he going to carry those flowers to? She\nmust be a splendidly handsome woman for so fine a bouquet. I want to see\nher.\"\n\nAnd no longer in pursuance of orders, but from personal curiosity, like\ndogs who hunt on their own account, he set out to follow Marius.\n\nMarius paid no attention to Theodule. Elegant women descended from the\ndiligence; he did not glance at them. He seemed to see nothing around\nhim.\n\n\"He is pretty deeply in love!\" thought Theodule.\n\nMarius directed his steps towards the church.\n\n\"Capital,\" said Theodule to himself. \"Rendezvous seasoned with a bit of\nmass are the best sort. Nothing is so exquisite as an ogle which passes\nover the good God's head.\"\n\nOn arriving at the church, Marius did not enter it, but skirted the\napse. He disappeared behind one of the angles of the apse.\n\n\"The rendezvous is appointed outside,\" said Theodule. \"Let's have a look\nat the lass.\"\n\nAnd he advanced on the tips of his boots towards the corner which Marius\nhad turned.\n\nOn arriving there, he halted in amazement.\n\nMarius, with his forehead clasped in his hands, was kneeling upon the\ngrass on a grave. He had strewn his bouquet there. At the extremity of\nthe grave, on a little swelling which marked the head, there stood\na cross of black wood with this name in white letters: COLONEL BARON\nPONTMERCY. Marius' sobs were audible.\n\nThe \"lass\" was a grave.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII--MARBLE AGAINST GRANITE\n\nIt was hither that Marius had come on the first occasion of his\nabsenting himself from Paris. It was hither that he had come every time\nthat M. Gillenormand had said: \"He is sleeping out.\"\n\nLieutenant Theodule was absolutely put out of countenance by this\nunexpected encounter with a sepulchre; he experienced a singular and\ndisagreeable sensation which he was incapable of analyzing, and which\nwas composed of respect for the tomb, mingled with respect for the\ncolonel. He retreated, leaving Marius alone in the cemetery, and\nthere was discipline in this retreat. Death appeared to him with large\nepaulets, and he almost made the military salute to him. Not knowing\nwhat to write to his aunt, he decided not to write at all; and it is\nprobable that nothing would have resulted from the discovery made\nby Theodule as to the love affairs of Marius, if, by one of those\nmysterious arrangements which are so frequent in chance, the scene at\nVernon had not had an almost immediate counter-shock at Paris.\n\nMarius returned from Vernon on the third day, in the middle of the\nmorning, descended at his grandfather's door, and, wearied by the two\nnights spent in the diligence, and feeling the need of repairing his\nloss of sleep by an hour at the swimming-school, he mounted rapidly to\nhis chamber, took merely time enough to throw off his travelling-coat,\nand the black ribbon which he wore round his neck, and went off to the\nbath.\n\nM. Gillenormand, who had risen betimes like all old men in good health,\nhad heard his entrance, and had made haste to climb, as quickly as his\nold legs permitted, the stairs to the upper story where Marius lived,\nin order to embrace him, and to question him while so doing, and to find\nout where he had been.\n\nBut the youth had taken less time to descend than the old man had to\nascend, and when Father Gillenormand entered the attic, Marius was no\nlonger there.\n\nThe bed had not been disturbed, and on the bed lay, outspread, but not\ndefiantly the great-coat and the black ribbon.\n\n\"I like this better,\" said M. Gillenormand.\n\nAnd a moment later, he made his entrance into the salon, where\nMademoiselle Gillenormand was already seated, busily embroidering her\ncart-wheels.\n\nThe entrance was a triumphant one.\n\nM. Gillenormand held in one hand the great-coat, and in the other the\nneck-ribbon, and exclaimed:--\n\n\"Victory! We are about to penetrate the mystery! We are going to\nlearn the most minute details; we are going to lay our finger on the\ndebaucheries of our sly friend! Here we have the romance itself. I have\nthe portrait!\"\n\nIn fact, a case of black shagreen, resembling a medallion portrait, was\nsuspended from the ribbon.\n\nThe old man took this case and gazed at it for some time without opening\nit, with that air of enjoyment, rapture, and wrath, with which a poor\nhungry fellow beholds an admirable dinner which is not for him, pass\nunder his very nose.\n\n\"For this evidently is a portrait. I know all about such things. That is\nworn tenderly on the heart. How stupid they are! Some abominable fright\nthat will make us shudder, probably! Young men have such bad taste\nnowadays!\"\n\n\"Let us see, father,\" said the old spinster.\n\nThe case opened by the pressure of a spring. They found in it nothing\nbut a carefully folded paper.\n\n\"From the same to the same,\" said M. Gillenormand, bursting with\nlaughter. \"I know what it is. A billet-doux.\"\n\n\"Ah! let us read it!\" said the aunt.\n\nAnd she put on her spectacles. They unfolded the paper and read as\nfollows:--\n\n\"For my son.--The Emperor made me a Baron on the battlefield of\nWaterloo. Since the Restoration disputes my right to this title which I\npurchased with my blood, my son shall take it and bear it. That he will\nbe worthy of it is a matter of course.\"\n\nThe feelings of father and daughter cannot be described. They felt\nchilled as by the breath of a death's-head. They did not exchange a\nword.\n\nOnly, M. Gillenormand said in a low voice and as though speaking to\nhimself:--\n\n\"It is the slasher's handwriting.\"\n\nThe aunt examined the paper, turned it about in all directions, then put\nit back in its case.\n\nAt the same moment a little oblong packet, enveloped in blue paper, fell\nfrom one of the pockets of the great-coat. Mademoiselle Gillenormand\npicked it up and unfolded the blue paper.\n\nIt contained Marius' hundred cards. She handed one of them to M.\nGillenormand, who read: Le Baron Marius Pontmercy.\n\nThe old man rang the bell. Nicolette came. M. Gillenormand took the\nribbon, the case, and the coat, flung them all on the floor in the\nmiddle of the room, and said:--\n\n\"Carry those duds away.\"\n\nA full hour passed in the most profound silence. The old man and the old\nspinster had seated themselves with their backs to each other, and were\nthinking, each on his own account, the same things, in all probability.\n\nAt the expiration of this hour, Aunt Gillenormand said:--\"A pretty state\nof things!\"\n\nA few moments later, Marius made his appearance. He entered. Even before\nhe had crossed the threshold, he saw his grandfather holding one of\nhis own cards in his hand, and on catching sight of him, the latter\nexclaimed with his air of bourgeois and grinning superiority which was\nsomething crushing:--\n\n\"Well! well! well! well! well! so you are a baron now. I present you my\ncompliments. What is the meaning of this?\"\n\nMarius reddened slightly and replied:--\n\n\"It means that I am the son of my father.\"\n\nM. Gillenormand ceased to laugh, and said harshly:--\n\n\"I am your father.\"\n\n\"My father,\" retorted Marius, with downcast eyes and a severe air, \"was\na humble and heroic man, who served the Republic and France gloriously,\nwho was great in the greatest history that men have ever made, who\nlived in the bivouac for a quarter of a century, beneath grape-shot and\nbullets, in snow and mud by day, beneath rain at night, who captured two\nflags, who received twenty wounds, who died forgotten and abandoned, and\nwho never committed but one mistake, which was to love too fondly two\ningrates, his country and myself.\"\n\nThis was more than M. Gillenormand could bear to hear. At the word\nrepublic, he rose, or, to speak more correctly, he sprang to his feet.\nEvery word that Marius had just uttered produced on the visage of the\nold Royalist the effect of the puffs of air from a forge upon a blazing\nbrand. From a dull hue he had turned red, from red, purple, and from\npurple, flame-colored.\n\n\"Marius!\" he cried. \"Abominable child! I do not know what your father\nwas! I do not wish to know! I know nothing about that, and I do not know\nhim! But what I do know is, that there never was anything but scoundrels\namong those men! They were all rascals, assassins, red-caps, thieves! I\nsay all! I say all! I know not one! I say all! Do you hear me, Marius!\nSee here, you are no more a baron than my slipper is! They were all\nbandits in the service of Robespierre! All who served B-u-o-naparte were\nbrigands! They were all traitors who betrayed, betrayed, betrayed their\nlegitimate king! All cowards who fled before the Prussians and the\nEnglish at Waterloo! That is what I do know! Whether Monsieur your\nfather comes in that category, I do not know! I am sorry for it, so much\nthe worse, your humble servant!\"\n\nIn his turn, it was Marius who was the firebrand and M. Gillenormand\nwho was the bellows. Marius quivered in every limb, he did not know what\nwould happen next, his brain was on fire. He was the priest who beholds\nall his sacred wafers cast to the winds, the fakir who beholds a\npasser-by spit upon his idol. It could not be that such things had been\nuttered in his presence. What was he to do? His father had just been\ntrampled under foot and stamped upon in his presence, but by whom? By\nhis grandfather. How was he to avenge the one without outraging the\nother? It was impossible for him to insult his grandfather and it was\nequally impossible for him to leave his father unavenged. On the one\nhand was a sacred grave, on the other hoary locks.\n\nHe stood there for several moments, staggering as though intoxicated,\nwith all this whirlwind dashing through his head; then he raised\nhis eyes, gazed fixedly at his grandfather, and cried in a voice of\nthunder:--\n\n\"Down with the Bourbons, and that great hog of a Louis XVIII.!\"\n\nLouis XVIII. had been dead for four years; but it was all the same to\nhim.\n\nThe old man, who had been crimson, turned whiter than his hair. He\nwheeled round towards a bust of M. le Duc de Berry, which stood on the\nchimney-piece, and made a profound bow, with a sort of peculiar majesty.\nThen he paced twice, slowly and in silence, from the fireplace to the\nwindow and from the window to the fireplace, traversing the whole length\nof the room, and making the polished floor creak as though he had been a\nstone statue walking.\n\nOn his second turn, he bent over his daughter, who was watching this\nencounter with the stupefied air of an antiquated lamb, and said to her\nwith a smile that was almost calm: \"A baron like this gentleman, and a\nbourgeois like myself cannot remain under the same roof.\"\n\nAnd drawing himself up, all at once, pallid, trembling, terrible, with\nhis brow rendered more lofty by the terrible radiance of wrath, he\nextended his arm towards Marius and shouted to him:--\n\n\"Be off!\"\n\nMarius left the house.\n\nOn the following day, M. Gillenormand said to his daughter:\n\n\"You will send sixty pistoles every six months to that blood-drinker,\nand you will never mention his name to me.\"\n\nHaving an immense reserve fund of wrath to get rid of, and not knowing\nwhat to do with it, he continued to address his daughter as you instead\nof thou for the next three months.\n\nMarius, on his side, had gone forth in indignation. There was one\ncircumstance which, it must be admitted, aggravated his exasperation.\nThere are always petty fatalities of the sort which complicate domestic\ndramas. They augment the grievances in such cases, although, in reality,\nthe wrongs are not increased by them. While carrying Marius' \"duds\"\nprecipitately to his chamber, at his grandfather's command, Nicolette\nhad, inadvertently, let fall, probably, on the attic staircase, which\nwas dark, that medallion of black shagreen which contained the paper\npenned by the colonel. Neither paper nor case could afterwards be found.\nMarius was convinced that \"Monsieur Gillenormand\"--from that day forth\nhe never alluded to him otherwise--had flung \"his father's testament\" in\nthe fire. He knew by heart the few lines which the colonel had written,\nand, consequently, nothing was lost. But the paper, the writing, that\nsacred relic,--all that was his very heart. What had been done with it?\n\nMarius had taken his departure without saying whither he was going, and\nwithout knowing where, with thirty francs, his watch, and a few clothes\nin a hand-bag. He had entered a hackney-coach, had engaged it by the\nhour, and had directed his course at hap-hazard towards the Latin\nquarter.\n\nWhat was to become of Marius?\n\n\n\n\nBOOK FOURTH.--THE FRIENDS OF THE A B C\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I--A GROUP WHICH BARELY MISSED BECOMING HISTORIC\n\nAt that epoch, which was, to all appearances indifferent, a certain\nrevolutionary quiver was vaguely current. Breaths which had started\nforth from the depths of '89 and '93 were in the air. Youth was on\nthe point, may the reader pardon us the word, of moulting. People were\nundergoing a transformation, almost without being conscious of it,\nthrough the movement of the age. The needle which moves round the\ncompass also moves in souls. Each person was taking that step in advance\nwhich he was bound to take. The Royalists were becoming liberals,\nliberals were turning democrats. It was a flood tide complicated with\na thousand ebb movements; the peculiarity of ebbs is to create\nintermixtures; hence the combination of very singular ideas; people\nadored both Napoleon and liberty. We are making history here. These\nwere the mirages of that period. Opinions traverse phases. Voltairian\nroyalism, a quaint variety, had a no less singular sequel, Bonapartist\nliberalism.\n\nOther groups of minds were more serious. In that direction, they\nsounded principles, they attached themselves to the right. They\ngrew enthusiastic for the absolute, they caught glimpses of infinite\nrealizations; the absolute, by its very rigidity, urges spirits towards\nthe sky and causes them to float in illimitable space. There is nothing\nlike dogma for bringing forth dreams. And there is nothing like dreams\nfor engendering the future. Utopia to-day, flesh and blood to-morrow.\n\nThese advanced opinions had a double foundation. A beginning of mystery\nmenaced \"the established order of things,\" which was suspicious and\nunderhand. A sign which was revolutionary to the highest degree. The\nsecond thoughts of power meet the second thoughts of the populace in\nthe mine. The incubation of insurrections gives the retort to the\npremeditation of coups d'etat.\n\nThere did not, as yet, exist in France any of those vast underlying\norganizations, like the German tugendbund and Italian Carbonarism; but\nhere and there there were dark underminings, which were in process of\nthrowing off shoots. The Cougourde was being outlined at Aix; there\nexisted at Paris, among other affiliations of that nature, the society\nof the Friends of the A B C.\n\nWhat were these Friends of the A B C? A society which had for its object\napparently the education of children, in reality the elevation of man.\n\nThey declared themselves the Friends of the A B C,--the Abaisse,--the\ndebased,--that is to say, the people. They wished to elevate the people.\nIt was a pun which we should do wrong to smile at. Puns are sometimes\nserious factors in politics; witness the Castratus ad castra, which made\na general of the army of Narses; witness: Barbari et Barberini; witness:\nTu es Petrus et super hanc petram, etc., etc.\n\nThe Friends of the A B C were not numerous, it was a secret society in\nthe state of embryo, we might almost say a coterie, if coteries ended in\nheroes. They assembled in Paris in two localities, near the fish-market,\nin a wine-shop called Corinthe, of which more will be heard later on,\nand near the Pantheon in a little cafe in the Rue Saint-Michel called\nthe Cafe Musain, now torn down; the first of these meeting-places was\nclose to the workingman, the second to the students.\n\nThe assemblies of the Friends of the A B C were usually held in a back\nroom of the Cafe Musain.\n\nThis hall, which was tolerably remote from the cafe, with which it was\nconnected by an extremely long corridor, had two windows and an exit\nwith a private stairway on the little Rue des Gres. There they smoked\nand drank, and gambled and laughed. There they conversed in very loud\ntones about everything, and in whispers of other things. An old map\nof France under the Republic was nailed to the wall,--a sign quite\nsufficient to excite the suspicion of a police agent.\n\nThe greater part of the Friends of the A B C were students, who were\non cordial terms with the working classes. Here are the names of the\nprincipal ones. They belong, in a certain measure, to history: Enjolras,\nCombeferre, Jean Prouvaire, Feuilly, Courfeyrac, Bahorel, Lesgle or\nLaigle, Joly, Grantaire.\n\nThese young men formed a sort of family, through the bond of friendship.\nAll, with the exception of Laigle, were from the South.\n\n[Illustration: Friends of the A B C  3b4-1-abc-friends]\n\nThis was a remarkable group. It vanished in the invisible depths which\nlie behind us. At the point of this drama which we have now reached,\nit will not perhaps be superfluous to throw a ray of light upon these\nyouthful heads, before the reader beholds them plunging into the shadow\nof a tragic adventure.\n\nEnjolras, whose name we have mentioned first of all,--the reader shall\nsee why later on,--was an only son and wealthy.\n\nEnjolras was a charming young man, who was capable of being terrible. He\nwas angelically handsome. He was a savage Antinous. One would have said,\nto see the pensive thoughtfulness of his glance, that he had already,\nin some previous state of existence, traversed the revolutionary\napocalypse. He possessed the tradition of it as though he had been a\nwitness. He was acquainted with all the minute details of the great\naffair. A pontifical and warlike nature, a singular thing in a youth. He\nwas an officiating priest and a man of war; from the immediate point of\nview, a soldier of the democracy; above the contemporary movement, the\npriest of the ideal. His eyes were deep, his lids a little red, his\nlower lip was thick and easily became disdainful, his brow was lofty. A\ngreat deal of brow in a face is like a great deal of horizon in a view.\nLike certain young men at the beginning of this century and the end of\nthe last, who became illustrious at an early age, he was endowed with\nexcessive youth, and was as rosy as a young girl, although subject to\nhours of pallor. Already a man, he still seemed a child. His two and\ntwenty years appeared to be but seventeen; he was serious, it did not\nseem as though he were aware there was on earth a thing called woman.\nHe had but one passion--the right; but one thought--to overthrow\nthe obstacle. On Mount Aventine, he would have been Gracchus; in the\nConvention, he would have been Saint-Just. He hardly saw the roses, he\nignored spring, he did not hear the carolling of the birds; the bare\nthroat of Evadne would have moved him no more than it would have moved\nAristogeiton; he, like Harmodius, thought flowers good for nothing\nexcept to conceal the sword. He was severe in his enjoyments. He\nchastely dropped his eyes before everything which was not the Republic.\nHe was the marble lover of liberty. His speech was harshly inspired,\nand had the thrill of a hymn. He was subject to unexpected outbursts of\nsoul. Woe to the love-affair which should have risked itself beside him!\nIf any grisette of the Place Cambrai or the Rue Saint-Jean-de-Beauvais,\nseeing that face of a youth escaped from college, that page's mien,\nthose long, golden lashes, those blue eyes, that hair billowing in the\nwind, those rosy cheeks, those fresh lips, those exquisite teeth, had\nconceived an appetite for that complete aurora, and had tried her beauty\non Enjolras, an astounding and terrible glance would have promptly shown\nher the abyss, and would have taught her not to confound the mighty\ncherub of Ezekiel with the gallant Cherubino of Beaumarchais.\n\nBy the side of Enjolras, who represented the logic of the Revolution,\nCombeferre represented its philosophy. Between the logic of the\nRevolution and its philosophy there exists this difference--that its\nlogic may end in war, whereas its philosophy can end only in peace.\nCombeferre complemented and rectified Enjolras. He was less lofty, but\nbroader. He desired to pour into all minds the extensive principles of\ngeneral ideas: he said: \"Revolution, but civilization\"; and around the\nmountain peak he opened out a vast view of the blue sky. The Revolution\nwas more adapted for breathing with Combeferre than with Enjolras.\nEnjolras expressed its divine right, and Combeferre its natural right.\nThe first attached himself to Robespierre; the second confined himself\nto Condorcet. Combeferre lived the life of all the rest of the world\nmore than did Enjolras. If it had been granted to these two young men to\nattain to history, the one would have been the just, the other the wise\nman. Enjolras was the more virile, Combeferre the more humane. Homo and\nvir, that was the exact effect of their different shades. Combeferre was\nas gentle as Enjolras was severe, through natural whiteness. He loved\nthe word citizen, but he preferred the word man. He would gladly\nhave said: Hombre, like the Spanish. He read everything, went to\nthe theatres, attended the courses of public lecturers, learned the\npolarization of light from Arago, grew enthusiastic over a lesson in\nwhich Geoffrey Sainte-Hilaire explained the double function of the\nexternal carotid artery, and the internal, the one which makes the face,\nand the one which makes the brain; he kept up with what was going\non, followed science step by step, compared Saint-Simon with Fourier,\ndeciphered hieroglyphics, broke the pebble which he found and reasoned\non geology, drew from memory a silkworm moth, pointed out the faulty\nFrench in the Dictionary of the Academy, studied Puysegur and Deleuze,\naffirmed nothing, not even miracles; denied nothing, not even ghosts;\nturned over the files of the Moniteur, reflected. He declared that the\nfuture lies in the hand of the schoolmaster, and busied himself with\neducational questions. He desired that society should labor without\nrelaxation at the elevation of the moral and intellectual level, at\ncoining science, at putting ideas into circulation, at increasing the\nmind in youthful persons, and he feared lest the present poverty of\nmethod, the paltriness from a literary point of view confined to two\nor three centuries called classic, the tyrannical dogmatism of official\npedants, scholastic prejudices and routines should end by converting our\ncolleges into artificial oyster beds. He was learned, a purist, exact,\na graduate of the Polytechnic, a close student, and at the same time,\nthoughtful \"even to chimaeras,\" so his friends said. He believed in\nall dreams, railroads, the suppression of suffering in chirurgical\noperations, the fixing of images in the dark chamber, the electric\ntelegraph, the steering of balloons. Moreover, he was not much alarmed\nby the citadels erected against the human mind in every direction, by\nsuperstition, despotism, and prejudice. He was one of those who think\nthat science will eventually turn the position. Enjolras was a chief,\nCombeferre was a guide. One would have liked to fight under the one and\nto march behind the other. It is not that Combeferre was not capable of\nfighting, he did not refuse a hand-to-hand combat with the obstacle, and\nto attack it by main force and explosively; but it suited him better to\nbring the human race into accord with its destiny gradually, by means of\neducation, the inculcation of axioms, the promulgation of positive laws;\nand, between two lights, his preference was rather for illumination than\nfor conflagration. A conflagration can create an aurora, no doubt, but\nwhy not await the dawn? A volcano illuminates, but daybreak furnishes a\nstill better illumination. Possibly, Combeferre preferred the whiteness\nof the beautiful to the blaze of the sublime. A light troubled by smoke,\nprogress purchased at the expense of violence, only half satisfied this\ntender and serious spirit. The headlong precipitation of a people into\nthe truth, a '93, terrified him; nevertheless, stagnation was still\nmore repulsive to him, in it he detected putrefaction and death; on the\nwhole, he preferred scum to miasma, and he preferred the torrent to the\ncesspool, and the falls of Niagara to the lake of Montfaucon. In\nshort, he desired neither halt nor haste. While his tumultuous friends,\ncaptivated by the absolute, adored and invoked splendid revolutionary\nadventures, Combeferre was inclined to let progress, good progress, take\nits own course; he may have been cold, but he was pure; methodical, but\nirreproachable; phlegmatic, but imperturbable. Combeferre would have\nknelt and clasped his hands to enable the future to arrive in all\nits candor, and that nothing might disturb the immense and virtuous\nevolution of the races. The good must be innocent, he repeated\nincessantly. And in fact, if the grandeur of the Revolution consists\nin keeping the dazzling ideal fixedly in view, and of soaring thither\nathwart the lightnings, with fire and blood in its talons, the beauty\nof progress lies in being spotless; and there exists between Washington,\nwho represents the one, and Danton, who incarnates the other, that\ndifference which separates the swan from the angel with the wings of an\neagle.\n\nJean Prouvaire was a still softer shade than Combeferre. His name\nwas Jehan, owing to that petty momentary freak which mingled with the\npowerful and profound movement whence sprang the very essential study\nof the Middle Ages. Jean Prouvaire was in love; he cultivated a pot\nof flowers, played on the flute, made verses, loved the people, pitied\nwoman, wept over the child, confounded God and the future in the same\nconfidence, and blamed the Revolution for having caused the fall of a\nroyal head, that of Andre Chenier. His voice was ordinarily delicate,\nbut suddenly grew manly. He was learned even to erudition, and almost an\nOrientalist. Above all, he was good; and, a very simple thing to those\nwho know how nearly goodness borders on grandeur, in the matter of\npoetry, he preferred the immense. He knew Italian, Latin, Greek, and\nHebrew; and these served him only for the perusal of four poets: Dante,\nJuvenal, AEschylus, and Isaiah. In French, he preferred Corneille to\nRacine, and Agrippa d'Aubigne to Corneille. He loved to saunter through\nfields of wild oats and corn-flowers, and busied himself with clouds\nnearly as much as with events. His mind had two attitudes, one on\nthe side towards man, the other on that towards God; he studied or\nhe contemplated. All day long, he buried himself in social questions,\nsalary, capital, credit, marriage, religion, liberty of thought,\neducation, penal servitude, poverty, association, property, production\nand sharing, the enigma of this lower world which covers the human\nant-hill with darkness; and at night, he gazed upon the planets, those\nenormous beings. Like Enjolras, he was wealthy and an only son. He spoke\nsoftly, bowed his head, lowered his eyes, smiled with embarrassment,\ndressed badly, had an awkward air, blushed at a mere nothing, and was\nvery timid. Yet he was intrepid.\n\nFeuilly was a workingman, a fan-maker, orphaned both of father and\nmother, who earned with difficulty three francs a day, and had but\none thought, to deliver the world. He had one other preoccupation, to\neducate himself; he called this also, delivering himself. He had taught\nhimself to read and write; everything that he knew, he had learned by\nhimself. Feuilly had a generous heart. The range of his embrace was\nimmense. This orphan had adopted the peoples. As his mother had\nfailed him, he meditated on his country. He brooded with the profound\ndivination of the man of the people, over what we now call the idea of\nthe nationality, had learned history with the express object of raging\nwith full knowledge of the case. In this club of young Utopians,\noccupied chiefly with France, he represented the outside world. He had\nfor his specialty Greece, Poland, Hungary, Roumania, Italy. He uttered\nthese names incessantly, appropriately and inappropriately, with the\ntenacity of right. The violations of Turkey on Greece and Thessaly, of\nRussia on Warsaw, of Austria on Venice, enraged him. Above all things,\nthe great violence of 1772 aroused him. There is no more sovereign\neloquence than the true in indignation; he was eloquent with that\neloquence. He was inexhaustible on that infamous date of 1772, on the\nsubject of that noble and valiant race suppressed by treason, and that\nthree-sided crime, on that monstrous ambush, the prototype and pattern\nof all those horrible suppressions of states, which, since that time,\nhave struck many a noble nation, and have annulled their certificate of\nbirth, so to speak. All contemporary social crimes have their origin in\nthe partition of Poland. The partition of Poland is a theorem of which\nall present political outrages are the corollaries. There has not been\na despot, nor a traitor for nearly a century back, who has not signed,\napproved, counter-signed, and copied, ne variatur, the partition of\nPoland. When the record of modern treasons was examined, that was the\nfirst thing which made its appearance. The congress of Vienna consulted\nthat crime before consummating its own. 1772 sounded the onset; 1815\nwas the death of the game. Such was Feuilly's habitual text. This\npoor workingman had constituted himself the tutor of Justice, and she\nrecompensed him by rendering him great. The fact is, that there is\neternity in right. Warsaw can no more be Tartar than Venice can be\nTeuton. Kings lose their pains and their honor in the attempt to make\nthem so. Sooner or later, the submerged part floats to the surface and\nreappears. Greece becomes Greece again, Italy is once more Italy. The\nprotest of right against the deed persists forever. The theft of a\nnation cannot be allowed by prescription. These lofty deeds of rascality\nhave no future. A nation cannot have its mark extracted like a pocket\nhandkerchief.\n\nCourfeyrac had a father who was called M. de Courfeyrac. One of\nthe false ideas of the bourgeoisie under the Restoration as regards\naristocracy and the nobility was to believe in the particle. The\nparticle, as every one knows, possesses no significance. But the\nbourgeois of the epoch of la Minerve estimated so highly that poor de,\nthat they thought themselves bound to abdicate it. M. de Chauvelin\nhad himself called M. Chauvelin; M. de Caumartin, M. Caumartin; M. de\nConstant de Robecque, Benjamin Constant; M. de Lafayette, M. Lafayette.\nCourfeyrac had not wished to remain behind the rest, and called himself\nplain Courfeyrac.\n\nWe might almost, so far as Courfeyrac is concerned, stop here,\nand confine ourselves to saying with regard to what remains: \"For\nCourfeyrac, see Tholomyes.\"\n\nCourfeyrac had, in fact, that animation of youth which may be called\nthe beaute du diable of the mind. Later on, this disappears like the\nplayfulness of the kitten, and all this grace ends, with the bourgeois,\non two legs, and with the tomcat, on four paws.\n\nThis sort of wit is transmitted from generation to generation of the\nsuccessive levies of youth who traverse the schools, who pass it from\nhand to hand, quasi cursores, and is almost always exactly the same;\nso that, as we have just pointed out, any one who had listened to\nCourfeyrac in 1828 would have thought he heard Tholomyes in 1817. Only,\nCourfeyrac was an honorable fellow. Beneath the apparent similarities\nof the exterior mind, the difference between him and Tholomyes was very\ngreat. The latent man which existed in the two was totally different\nin the first from what it was in the second. There was in Tholomyes a\ndistrict attorney, and in Courfeyrac a paladin.\n\nEnjolras was the chief, Combeferre was the guide, Courfeyrac was the\ncentre. The others gave more light, he shed more warmth; the truth is,\nthat he possessed all the qualities of a centre, roundness and radiance.\n\nBahorel had figured in the bloody tumult of June, 1822, on the occasion\nof the burial of young Lallemand.\n\nBahorel was a good-natured mortal, who kept bad company, brave, a\nspendthrift, prodigal, and to the verge of generosity, talkative, and\nat times eloquent, bold to the verge of effrontery; the best fellow\npossible; he had daring waistcoats, and scarlet opinions; a wholesale\nblusterer, that is to say, loving nothing so much as a quarrel, unless\nit were an uprising; and nothing so much as an uprising, unless it were\na revolution; always ready to smash a window-pane, then to tear up the\npavement, then to demolish a government, just to see the effect of it;\na student in his eleventh year. He had nosed about the law, but did not\npractise it. He had taken for his device: \"Never a lawyer,\" and for his\narmorial bearings a nightstand in which was visible a square cap. Every\ntime that he passed the law-school, which rarely happened, he buttoned\nup his frock-coat,--the paletot had not yet been invented,--and took\nhygienic precautions. Of the school porter he said: \"What a fine\nold man!\" and of the dean, M. Delvincourt: \"What a monument!\" In his\nlectures he espied subjects for ballads, and in his professors occasions\nfor caricature. He wasted a tolerably large allowance, something like\nthree thousand francs a year, in doing nothing.\n\nHe had peasant parents whom he had contrived to imbue with respect for\ntheir son.\n\nHe said of them: \"They are peasants and not bourgeois; that is the\nreason they are intelligent.\"\n\nBahorel, a man of caprice, was scattered over numerous cafes; the others\nhad habits, he had none. He sauntered. To stray is human. To saunter\nis Parisian. In reality, he had a penetrating mind and was more of a\nthinker than appeared to view.\n\nHe served as a connecting link between the Friends of the A B C and\nother still unorganized groups, which were destined to take form later\non.\n\nIn this conclave of young heads, there was one bald member.\n\nThe Marquis d'Avaray, whom Louis XVIII. made a duke for having assisted\nhim to enter a hackney-coach on the day when he emigrated, was wont\nto relate, that in 1814, on his return to France, as the King was\ndisembarking at Calais, a man handed him a petition.\n\n\"What is your request?\" said the King.\n\n\"Sire, a post-office.\"\n\n\"What is your name?\"\n\n\"L'Aigle.\"\n\nThe King frowned, glanced at the signature of the petition and beheld\nthe name written thus: LESGLE. This non-Bonoparte orthography touched\nthe King and he began to smile. \"Sire,\" resumed the man with the\npetition, \"I had for ancestor a keeper of the hounds surnamed\nLesgueules. This surname furnished my name. I am called Lesgueules, by\ncontraction Lesgle, and by corruption l'Aigle.\" This caused the King\nto smile broadly. Later on he gave the man the posting office of Meaux,\neither intentionally or accidentally.\n\nThe bald member of the group was the son of this Lesgle, or Legle, and\nhe signed himself, Legle [de Meaux]. As an abbreviation, his companions\ncalled him Bossuet.\n\nBossuet was a gay but unlucky fellow. His specialty was not to succeed\nin anything. As an offset, he laughed at everything. At five and twenty\nhe was bald. His father had ended by owning a house and a field; but\nhe, the son, had made haste to lose that house and field in a bad\nspeculation. He had nothing left. He possessed knowledge and wit, but\nall he did miscarried. Everything failed him and everybody deceived him;\nwhat he was building tumbled down on top of him. If he were splitting\nwood, he cut off a finger. If he had a mistress, he speedily discovered\nthat he had a friend also. Some misfortune happened to him every moment,\nhence his joviality. He said: \"I live under falling tiles.\" He was\nnot easily astonished, because, for him, an accident was what he had\nforeseen, he took his bad luck serenely, and smiled at the teasing of\nfate, like a person who is listening to pleasantries. He was poor, but\nhis fund of good humor was inexhaustible. He soon reached his last sou,\nnever his last burst of laughter. When adversity entered his doors, he\nsaluted this old acquaintance cordially, he tapped all catastrophes on\nthe stomach; he was familiar with fatality to the point of calling it by\nits nickname: \"Good day, Guignon,\" he said to it.\n\nThese persecutions of fate had rendered him inventive. He was full of\nresources. He had no money, but he found means, when it seemed good to\nhim, to indulge in \"unbridled extravagance.\" One night, he went so far\nas to eat a \"hundred francs\" in a supper with a wench, which inspired\nhim to make this memorable remark in the midst of the orgy: \"Pull off my\nboots, you five-louis jade.\"\n\nBossuet was slowly directing his steps towards the profession of a\nlawyer; he was pursuing his law studies after the manner of Bahorel.\nBossuet had not much domicile, sometimes none at all. He lodged now with\none, now with another, most often with Joly. Joly was studying medicine.\nHe was two years younger than Bossuet.\n\nJoly was the \"malade imaginaire\" junior. What he had won in medicine was\nto be more of an invalid than a doctor. At three and twenty he thought\nhimself a valetudinarian, and passed his life in inspecting his tongue\nin the mirror. He affirmed that man becomes magnetic like a needle, and\nin his chamber he placed his bed with its head to the south, and the\nfoot to the north, so that, at night, the circulation of his blood\nmight not be interfered with by the great electric current of the globe.\nDuring thunder storms, he felt his pulse. Otherwise, he was the gayest\nof them all. All these young, maniacal, puny, merry incoherences lived\nin harmony together, and the result was an eccentric and agreeable\nbeing whom his comrades, who were prodigal of winged consonants, called\nJolllly. \"You may fly away on the four L's,\" Jean Prouvaire said to\nhim.[23]\n\nJoly had a trick of touching his nose with the tip of his cane, which is\nan indication of a sagacious mind.\n\nAll these young men who differed so greatly, and who, on the whole, can\nonly be discussed seriously, held the same religion: Progress.\n\nAll were the direct sons of the French Revolution. The most giddy of\nthem became solemn when they pronounced that date: '89. Their fathers in\nthe flesh had been, either royalists, doctrinaires, it matters not what;\nthis confusion anterior to themselves, who were young, did not concern\nthem at all; the pure blood of principle ran in their veins. They\nattached themselves, without intermediate shades, to incorruptible right\nand absolute duty.\n\nAffiliated and initiated, they sketched out the ideal underground.\n\nAmong all these glowing hearts and thoroughly convinced minds, there was\none sceptic. How came he there? By juxtaposition. This sceptic's name\nwas Grantaire, and he was in the habit of signing himself with this\nrebus: R. Grantaire was a man who took good care not to believe in\nanything. Moreover, he was one of the students who had learned the most\nduring their course at Paris; he knew that the best coffee was to be had\nat the Cafe Lemblin, and the best billiards at the Cafe Voltaire, that\ngood cakes and lasses were to be found at the Ermitage, on the Boulevard\ndu Maine, spatchcocked chickens at Mother Sauget's, excellent matelotes\nat the Barriere de la Cunette, and a certain thin white wine at the\nBarriere du Com pat. He knew the best place for everything; in\naddition, boxing and foot-fencing and some dances; and he was a thorough\nsingle-stick player. He was a tremendous drinker to boot. He was\ninordinately homely: the prettiest boot-stitcher of that day, Irma\nBoissy, enraged with his homeliness, pronounced sentence on him as\nfollows: \"Grantaire is impossible\"; but Grantaire's fatuity was not to\nbe disconcerted. He stared tenderly and fixedly at all women, with the\nair of saying to them all: \"If I only chose!\" and of trying to make his\ncomrades believe that he was in general demand.\n\nAll those words: rights of the people, rights of man, the social\ncontract, the French Revolution, the Republic, democracy, humanity,\ncivilization, religion, progress, came very near to signifying nothing\nwhatever to Grantaire. He smiled at them. Scepticism, that caries of the\nintelligence, had not left him a single whole idea. He lived with irony.\nThis was his axiom: \"There is but one certainty, my full glass.\" He\nsneered at all devotion in all parties, the father as well as the\nbrother, Robespierre junior as well as Loizerolles. \"They are greatly in\nadvance to be dead,\" he exclaimed. He said of the crucifix: \"There is a\ngibbet which has been a success.\" A rover, a gambler, a libertine,\noften drunk, he displeased these young dreamers by humming incessantly:\n\"J'aimons les filles, et j'aimons le bon vin.\" Air: Vive Henri IV.\n\nHowever, this sceptic had one fanaticism. This fanaticism was neither a\ndogma, nor an idea, nor an art, nor a science; it was a man: Enjolras.\nGrantaire admired, loved, and venerated Enjolras. To whom did this\nanarchical scoffer unite himself in this phalanx of absolute minds? To\nthe most absolute. In what manner had Enjolras subjugated him? By his\nideas? No. By his character. A phenomenon which is often observable.\nA sceptic who adheres to a believer is as simple as the law of\ncomplementary colors. That which we lack attracts us. No one loves the\nlight like the blind man. The dwarf adores the drum-major. The toad\nalways has his eyes fixed on heaven. Why? In order to watch the bird in\nits flight. Grantaire, in whom writhed doubt, loved to watch faith\nsoar in Enjolras. He had need of Enjolras. That chaste, healthy, firm,\nupright, hard, candid nature charmed him, without his being clearly\naware of it, and without the idea of explaining it to himself having\noccurred to him. He admired his opposite by instinct. His soft,\nyielding, dislocated, sickly, shapeless ideas attached themselves\nto Enjolras as to a spinal column. His moral backbone leaned on that\nfirmness. Grantaire in the presence of Enjolras became some one once\nmore. He was, himself, moreover, composed of two elements, which were,\nto all appearance, incompatible. He was ironical and cordial. His\nindifference loved. His mind could get along without belief, but his\nheart could not get along without friendship. A profound contradiction;\nfor an affection is a conviction. His nature was thus constituted. There\nare men who seem to be born to be the reverse, the obverse, the wrong\nside. They are Pollux, Patrocles, Nisus, Eudamidas, Ephestion, Pechmeja.\nThey only exist on condition that they are backed up with another man;\ntheir name is a sequel, and is only written preceded by the conjunction\nand; and their existence is not their own; it is the other side of an\nexistence which is not theirs. Grantaire was one of these men. He was\nthe obverse of Enjolras.\n\nOne might almost say that affinities begin with the letters of the\nalphabet. In the series O and P are inseparable. You can, at will,\npronounce O and P or Orestes and Pylades.\n\nGrantaire, Enjolras' true satellite, inhabited this circle of young men;\nhe lived there, he took no pleasure anywhere but there; he followed them\neverywhere. His joy was to see these forms go and come through the fumes\nof wine. They tolerated him on account of his good humor.\n\nEnjolras, the believer, disdained this sceptic; and, a sober man\nhimself, scorned this drunkard. He accorded him a little lofty pity.\nGrantaire was an unaccepted Pylades. Always harshly treated by Enjolras,\nroughly repulsed, rejected yet ever returning to the charge, he said of\nEnjolras: \"What fine marble!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II--BLONDEAU'S FUNERAL ORATION BY BOSSUET\n\nOn a certain afternoon, which had, as will be seen hereafter, some\ncoincidence with the events heretofore related, Laigle de Meaux was to\nbe seen leaning in a sensual manner against the doorpost of the Cafe\nMusain. He had the air of a caryatid on a vacation; he carried nothing\nbut his revery, however. He was staring at the Place Saint-Michel.\nTo lean one's back against a thing is equivalent to lying down while\nstanding erect, which attitude is not hated by thinkers. Laigle de Meaux\nwas pondering without melancholy, over a little misadventure which\nhad befallen him two days previously at the law-school, and which had\nmodified his personal plans for the future, plans which were rather\nindistinct in any case.\n\nRevery does not prevent a cab from passing by, nor the dreamer from\ntaking note of that cab. Laigle de Meaux, whose eyes were straying about\nin a sort of diffuse lounging, perceived, athwart his somnambulism, a\ntwo-wheeled vehicle proceeding through the place, at a foot pace and\napparently in indecision. For whom was this cabriolet? Why was it\ndriving at a walk? Laigle took a survey. In it, beside the coachman, sat\na young man, and in front of the young man lay a rather bulky hand-bag.\nThe bag displayed to passers-by the following name inscribed in large\nblack letters on a card which was sewn to the stuff: MARIUS PONTMERCY.\n\nThis name caused Laigle to change his attitude. He drew himself up and\nhurled this apostrophe at the young man in the cabriolet:--\n\n\"Monsieur Marius Pontmercy!\"\n\nThe cabriolet thus addressed came to a halt.\n\nThe young man, who also seemed deeply buried in thought, raised his\neyes:--\n\n\"Hey?\" said he.\n\n\"You are M. Marius Pontmercy?\"\n\n\"Certainly.\"\n\n\"I was looking for you,\" resumed Laigle de Meaux.\n\n\"How so?\" demanded Marius; for it was he: in fact, he had just quitted\nhis grandfather's, and had before him a face which he now beheld for the\nfirst time. \"I do not know you.\"\n\n\"Neither do I know you,\" responded Laigle.\n\nMarius thought he had encountered a wag, the beginning of a\nmystification in the open street. He was not in a very good humor at the\nmoment. He frowned. Laigle de Meaux went on imperturbably:--\n\n\"You were not at the school day before yesterday.\"\n\n\"That is possible.\"\n\n\"That is certain.\"\n\n\"You are a student?\" demanded Marius.\n\n\"Yes, sir. Like yourself. Day before yesterday, I entered the school, by\nchance. You know, one does have such freaks sometimes. The professor was\njust calling the roll. You are not unaware that they are very ridiculous\non such occasions. At the third call, unanswered, your name is erased\nfrom the list. Sixty francs in the gulf.\"\n\nMarius began to listen.\n\n\"It was Blondeau who was making the call. You know Blondeau, he has a\nvery pointed and very malicious nose, and he delights to scent out the\nabsent. He slyly began with the letter P. I was not listening, not being\ncompromised by that letter. The call was not going badly. No erasures;\nthe universe was present. Blondeau was grieved. I said to myself:\n'Blondeau, my love, you will not get the very smallest sort of an\nexecution to-day.' All at once Blondeau calls, 'Marius Pontmercy!' No\none answers. Blondeau, filled with hope, repeats more loudly: 'Marius\nPontmercy!' And he takes his pen. Monsieur, I have bowels of compassion.\nI said to myself hastily: 'Here's a brave fellow who is going to get\nscratched out. Attention. Here is a veritable mortal who is not exact.\nHe's not a good student. Here is none of your heavy-sides, a student who\nstudies, a greenhorn pedant, strong on letters, theology, science, and\nsapience, one of those dull wits cut by the square; a pin by profession.\nHe is an honorable idler who lounges, who practises country jaunts, who\ncultivates the grisette, who pays court to the fair sex, who is at\nthis very moment, perhaps, with my mistress. Let us save him. Death to\nBlondeau!' At that moment, Blondeau dipped his pen in, all black with\nerasures in the ink, cast his yellow eyes round the audience room, and\nrepeated for the third time: 'Marius Pontmercy!' I replied: 'Present!'\nThis is why you were not crossed off.\"\n\n\"Monsieur!--\" said Marius.\n\n\"And why I was,\" added Laigle de Meaux.\n\n\"I do not understand you,\" said Marius.\n\nLaigle resumed:--\n\n\"Nothing is more simple. I was close to the desk to reply, and close\nto the door for the purpose of flight. The professor gazed at me with a\ncertain intensity. All of a sudden, Blondeau, who must be the malicious\nnose alluded to by Boileau, skipped to the letter L. L is my letter. I\nam from Meaux, and my name is Lesgle.\"\n\n\"L'Aigle!\" interrupted Marius, \"what fine name!\"\n\n\"Monsieur, Blondeau came to this fine name, and called: 'Laigle!' I\nreply: 'Present!' Then Blondeau gazes at me, with the gentleness of a\ntiger, and says to me: 'If you are Pontmercy, you are not Laigle.' A\nphrase which has a disobliging air for you, but which was lugubrious\nonly for me. That said, he crossed me off.\"\n\nMarius exclaimed:--\n\n\"I am mortified, sir--\"\n\n\"First of all,\" interposed Laigle, \"I demand permission to embalm\nBlondeau in a few phrases of deeply felt eulogium. I will assume that he\nis dead. There will be no great change required in his gauntness, in\nhis pallor, in his coldness, and in his smell. And I say: 'Erudimini\nqui judicatis terram. Here lies Blondeau, Blondeau the Nose, Blondeau\nNasica, the ox of discipline, bos disciplinae, the bloodhound of the\npassword, the angel of the roll-call, who was upright, square exact,\nrigid, honest, and hideous. God crossed him off as he crossed me off.'\"\n\nMarius resumed:--\n\n\"I am very sorry--\"\n\n\"Young man,\" said Laigle de Meaux, \"let this serve you as a lesson. In\nfuture, be exact.\"\n\n\"I really beg you a thousand pardons.\"\n\n\"Do not expose your neighbor to the danger of having his name erased\nagain.\"\n\n\"I am extremely sorry--\"\n\nLaigle burst out laughing.\n\n\"And I am delighted. I was on the brink of becoming a lawyer. This\nerasure saves me. I renounce the triumphs of the bar. I shall not defend\nthe widow, and I shall not attack the orphan. No more toga, no more\nstage. Here is my erasure all ready for me. It is to you that I am\nindebted for it, Monsieur Pontmercy. I intend to pay a solemn call of\nthanks upon you. Where do you live?\"\n\n\"In this cab,\" said Marius.\n\n\"A sign of opulence,\" retorted Laigle calmly. \"I congratulate you. You\nhave there a rent of nine thousand francs per annum.\"\n\nAt that moment, Courfeyrac emerged from the cafe.\n\nMarius smiled sadly.\n\n\"I have paid this rent for the last two hours, and I aspire to get rid\nof it; but there is a sort of history attached to it, and I don't know\nwhere to go.\"\n\n\"Come to my place, sir,\" said Courfeyrac.\n\n\"I have the priority,\" observed Laigle, \"but I have no home.\"\n\n\"Hold your tongue, Bossuet,\" said Courfeyrac.\n\n\"Bossuet,\" said Marius, \"but I thought that your name was Laigle.\"\n\n\"De Meaux,\" replied Laigle; \"by metaphor, Bossuet.\"\n\nCourfeyrac entered the cab.\n\n\"Coachman,\" said he, \"hotel de la Porte-Saint-Jacques.\"\n\nAnd that very evening, Marius found himself installed in a chamber of\nthe hotel de la Porte-Saint-Jacques side by side with Courfeyrac.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III--MARIUS' ASTONISHMENTS\n\nIn a few days, Marius had become Courfeyrac's friend. Youth is the\nseason for prompt welding and the rapid healing of scars. Marius\nbreathed freely in Courfeyrac's society, a decidedly new thing for him.\nCourfeyrac put no questions to him. He did not even think of such a\nthing. At that age, faces disclose everything on the spot. Words are\nsuperfluous. There are young men of whom it can be said that their\ncountenances chatter. One looks at them and one knows them.\n\nOne morning, however, Courfeyrac abruptly addressed this interrogation\nto him:--\n\n\"By the way, have you any political opinions?\"\n\n\"The idea!\" said Marius, almost affronted by the question.\n\n\"What are you?\"\n\n\"A democrat-Bonapartist.\"\n\n\"The gray hue of a reassured rat,\" said Courfeyrac.\n\nOn the following day, Courfeyrac introduced Marius at the Cafe Musain.\nThen he whispered in his ear, with a smile: \"I must give you your entry\nto the revolution.\" And he led him to the hall of the Friends of the A B\nC. He presented him to the other comrades, saying this simple word which\nMarius did not understand: \"A pupil.\"\n\nMarius had fallen into a wasps'-nest of wits. However, although he was\nsilent and grave, he was, none the less, both winged and armed.\n\nMarius, up to that time solitary and inclined to soliloquy, and to\nasides, both by habit and by taste, was a little fluttered by this covey\nof young men around him. All these various initiatives solicited his\nattention at once, and pulled him about. The tumultuous movements of\nthese minds at liberty and at work set his ideas in a whirl. Sometimes,\nin his trouble, they fled so far from him, that he had difficulty in\nrecovering them. He heard them talk of philosophy, of literature, of\nart, of history, of religion, in unexpected fashion. He caught glimpses\nof strange aspects; and, as he did not place them in proper perspective,\nhe was not altogether sure that it was not chaos that he grasped. On\nabandoning his grandfather's opinions for the opinions of his father,\nhe had supposed himself fixed; he now suspected, with uneasiness, and\nwithout daring to avow it to himself, that he was not. The angle\nat which he saw everything began to be displaced anew. A certain\noscillation set all the horizons of his brains in motion. An odd\ninternal upsetting. He almost suffered from it.\n\nIt seemed as though there were no \"consecrated things\" for those young\nmen. Marius heard singular propositions on every sort of subject, which\nembarrassed his still timid mind.\n\nA theatre poster presented itself, adorned with the title of a tragedy\nfrom the ancient repertory called classic: \"Down with tragedy dear to\nthe bourgeois!\" cried Bahorel. And Marius heard Combeferre reply:--\n\n\"You are wrong, Bahorel. The bourgeoisie loves tragedy, and the\nbourgeoisie must be left at peace on that score. Bewigged tragedy has\na reason for its existence, and I am not one of those who, by order of\nAEschylus, contest its right to existence. There are rough outlines in\nnature; there are, in creation, ready-made parodies; a beak which is not\na beak, wings which are not wings, gills which are not gills, paws which\nare not paws, a cry of pain which arouses a desire to laugh, there is\nthe duck. Now, since poultry exists by the side of the bird, I do\nnot see why classic tragedy should not exist in the face of antique\ntragedy.\"\n\nOr chance decreed that Marius should traverse Rue Jean-Jacques Rousseau\nbetween Enjolras and Courfeyrac.\n\nCourfeyrac took his arm:--\n\n\"Pay attention. This is the Rue Platriere, now called Rue Jean-Jacques\nRousseau, on account of a singular household which lived in it sixty\nyears ago. This consisted of Jean-Jacques and Therese. From time\nto time, little beings were born there. Therese gave birth to them,\nJean-Jacques represented them as foundlings.\"\n\nAnd Enjolras addressed Courfeyrac roughly:--\n\n\"Silence in the presence of Jean-Jacques! I admire that man. He denied\nhis own children, that may be; but he adopted the people.\"\n\nNot one of these young men articulated the word: The Emperor.\nJean Prouvaire alone sometimes said Napoleon; all the others said\n\"Bonaparte.\" Enjolras pronounced it \"Buonaparte.\"\n\nMarius was vaguely surprised. Initium sapientiae.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV--THE BACK ROOM OF THE CAFE MUSAIN\n\nOne of the conversations among the young men, at which Marius was\npresent and in which he sometimes joined, was a veritable shock to his\nmind.\n\nThis took place in the back room of the Cafe Musain. Nearly all the\nFriends of the A B C had convened that evening. The argand lamp was\nsolemnly lighted. They talked of one thing and another, without passion\nand with noise. With the exception of Enjolras and Marius, who held\ntheir peace, all were haranguing rather at hap-hazard. Conversations\nbetween comrades sometimes are subject to these peaceable tumults. It\nwas a game and an uproar as much as a conversation. They tossed words\nto each other and caught them up in turn. They were chattering in all\nquarters.\n\nNo woman was admitted to this back room, except Louison, the dish-washer\nof the cafe, who passed through it from time to time, to go to her\nwashing in the \"lavatory.\"\n\nGrantaire, thoroughly drunk, was deafening the corner of which he had\ntaken possession, reasoning and contradicting at the top of his lungs,\nand shouting:--\n\n\"I am thirsty. Mortals, I am dreaming: that the tun of Heidelberg has an\nattack of apoplexy, and that I am one of the dozen leeches which will\nbe applied to it. I want a drink. I desire to forget life. Life is a\nhideous invention of I know not whom. It lasts no time at all, and is\nworth nothing. One breaks one's neck in living. Life is a theatre set in\nwhich there are but few practicable entrances. Happiness is an antique\nreliquary painted on one side only. Ecclesiastes says: 'All is vanity.'\nI agree with that good man, who never existed, perhaps. Zero not wishing\nto go stark naked, clothed himself in vanity. O vanity! The patching up\nof everything with big words! a kitchen is a laboratory, a dancer is a\nprofessor, an acrobat is a gymnast, a boxer is a pugilist, an apothecary\nis a chemist, a wigmaker is an artist, a hodman is an architect, a\njockey is a sportsman, a wood-louse is a pterigybranche. Vanity has a\nright and a wrong side; the right side is stupid, it is the negro with\nhis glass beads; the wrong side is foolish, it is the philosopher with\nhis rags. I weep over the one and I laugh over the other. What are\ncalled honors and dignities, and even dignity and honor, are generally\nof pinchbeck. Kings make playthings of human pride. Caligula made a\nhorse a consul; Charles II. made a knight of a sirloin. Wrap yourself\nup now, then, between Consul Incitatus and Baronet Roastbeef. As for\nthe intrinsic value of people, it is no longer respectable in the least.\nListen to the panegyric which neighbor makes of neighbor. White on white\nis ferocious; if the lily could speak, what a setting down it would give\nthe dove! A bigoted woman prating of a devout woman is more venomous\nthan the asp and the cobra. It is a shame that I am ignorant, otherwise\nI would quote to you a mass of things; but I know nothing. For instance,\nI have always been witty; when I was a pupil of Gros, instead of\ndaubing wretched little pictures, I passed my time in pilfering apples;\nrapin[24] is the masculine of rapine. So much for myself; as for\nthe rest of you, you are worth no more than I am. I scoff at your\nperfections, excellencies, and qualities. Every good quality tends\ntowards a defect; economy borders on avarice, the generous man is next\ndoor to the prodigal, the brave man rubs elbows with the braggart; he\nwho says very pious says a trifle bigoted; there are just as many vices\nin virtue as there are holes in Diogenes' cloak. Whom do you admire, the\nslain or the slayer, Caesar or Brutus? Generally men are in favor of the\nslayer. Long live Brutus, he has slain! There lies the virtue. Virtue,\ngranted, but madness also. There are queer spots on those great men. The\nBrutus who killed Caesar was in love with the statue of a little boy.\nThis statue was from the hand of the Greek sculptor Strongylion,\nwho also carved that figure of an Amazon known as the Beautiful Leg,\nEucnemos, which Nero carried with him in his travels. This Strongylion\nleft but two statues which placed Nero and Brutus in accord. Brutus was\nin love with the one, Nero with the other. All history is nothing but\nwearisome repetition. One century is the plagiarist of the other. The\nbattle of Marengo copies the battle of Pydna; the Tolbiac of Clovis and\nthe Austerlitz of Napoleon are as like each other as two drops of water.\nI don't attach much importance to victory. Nothing is so stupid as to\nconquer; true glory lies in convincing. But try to prove something! If\nyou are content with success, what mediocrity, and with conquering, what\nwretchedness! Alas, vanity and cowardice everywhere. Everything obeys\nsuccess, even grammar. Si volet usus, says Horace. Therefore I disdain\nthe human race. Shall we descend to the party at all? Do you wish me\nto begin admiring the peoples? What people, if you please? Shall it be\nGreece? The Athenians, those Parisians of days gone by, slew Phocion,\nas we might say Coligny, and fawned upon tyrants to such an extent that\nAnacephorus said of Pisistratus: \"His urine attracts the bees.\" The most\nprominent man in Greece for fifty years was that grammarian Philetas,\nwho was so small and so thin that he was obliged to load his shoes with\nlead in order not to be blown away by the wind. There stood on the great\nsquare in Corinth a statue carved by Silanion and catalogued by Pliny;\nthis statue represented Episthates. What did Episthates do? He invented\na trip. That sums up Greece and glory. Let us pass on to others. Shall I\nadmire England? Shall I admire France? France? Why? Because of Paris?\nI have just told you my opinion of Athens. England? Why? Because of\nLondon? I hate Carthage. And then, London, the metropolis of luxury, is\nthe headquarters of wretchedness. There are a hundred deaths a year of\nhunger in the parish of Charing-Cross alone. Such is Albion. I add,\nas the climax, that I have seen an Englishwoman dancing in a wreath of\nroses and blue spectacles. A fig then for England! If I do not admire\nJohn Bull, shall I admire Brother Jonathan? I have but little taste for\nthat slave-holding brother. Take away Time is money, what remains of\nEngland? Take away Cotton is king, what remains of America? Germany is\nthe lymph, Italy is the bile. Shall we go into ecstasies over Russia?\nVoltaire admired it. He also admired China. I admit that Russia has its\nbeauties, among others, a stout despotism; but I pity the despots.\nTheir health is delicate. A decapitated Alexis, a poignarded Peter,\na strangled Paul, another Paul crushed flat with kicks, divers Ivans\nstrangled, with their throats cut, numerous Nicholases and Basils\npoisoned, all this indicates that the palace of the Emperors of Russia\nis in a condition of flagrant insalubrity. All civilized peoples offer\nthis detail to the admiration of the thinker; war; now, war, civilized\nwar, exhausts and sums up all the forms of ruffianism, from the\nbrigandage of the Trabuceros in the gorges of Mont Jaxa to the marauding\nof the Comanche Indians in the Doubtful Pass. 'Bah!' you will say to\nme, 'but Europe is certainly better than Asia?' I admit that Asia is a\nfarce; but I do not precisely see what you find to laugh at in the Grand\nLama, you peoples of the west, who have mingled with your fashions and\nyour elegances all the complicated filth of majesty, from the dirty\nchemise of Queen Isabella to the chamber-chair of the Dauphin. Gentlemen\nof the human race, I tell you, not a bit of it! It is at Brussels that\nthe most beer is consumed, at Stockholm the most brandy, at Madrid the\nmost chocolate, at Amsterdam the most gin, at London the most wine, at\nConstantinople the most coffee, at Paris the most absinthe; there are\nall the useful notions. Paris carries the day, in short. In Paris,\neven the rag-pickers are sybarites; Diogenes would have loved to be a\nrag-picker of the Place Maubert better than to be a philosopher at the\nPiraeus. Learn this in addition; the wineshops of the ragpickers\nare called bibines; the most celebrated are the Saucepan and The\nSlaughter-House. Hence, tea-gardens, goguettes, caboulots, bouibuis,\nmastroquets, bastringues, manezingues, bibines of the rag-pickers,\ncaravanseries of the caliphs, I certify to you, I am a voluptuary, I eat\nat Richard's at forty sous a head, I must have Persian carpets to roll\nnaked Cleopatra in! Where is Cleopatra? Ah! So it is you, Louison. Good\nday.\"\n\nThus did Grantaire, more than intoxicated, launch into speech, catching\nat the dish-washer in her passage, from his corner in the back room of\nthe Cafe Musain.\n\nBossuet, extending his hand towards him, tried to impose silence on him,\nand Grantaire began again worse than ever:--\n\n\"Aigle de Meaux, down with your paws. You produce on me no effect with\nyour gesture of Hippocrates refusing Artaxerxes' bric-a-brac. I excuse\nyou from the task of soothing me. Moreover, I am sad. What do you wish\nme to say to you? Man is evil, man is deformed; the butterfly is a\nsuccess, man is a failure. God made a mistake with that animal. A\ncrowd offers a choice of ugliness. The first comer is a wretch,\nFemme--woman--rhymes with infame,--infamous. Yes, I have the spleen,\ncomplicated with melancholy, with homesickness, plus hypochondria, and\nI am vexed and I rage, and I yawn, and I am bored, and I am tired to\ndeath, and I am stupid! Let God go to the devil!\"\n\n\"Silence then, capital R!\" resumed Bossuet, who was discussing a point\nof law behind the scenes, and who was plunged more than waist high in a\nphrase of judicial slang, of which this is the conclusion:--\n\n\"--And as for me, although I am hardly a legist, and at the most, an\namateur attorney, I maintain this: that, in accordance with the terms\nof the customs of Normandy, at Saint-Michel, and for each year, an\nequivalent must be paid to the profit of the lord of the manor, saving\nthe rights of others, and by all and several, the proprietors as well\nas those seized with inheritance, and that, for all emphyteuses, leases,\nfreeholds, contracts of domain, mortgages--\"\n\n\"Echo, plaintive nymph,\" hummed Grantaire.\n\nNear Grantaire, an almost silent table, a sheet of paper, an inkstand\nand a pen between two glasses of brandy, announced that a vaudeville was\nbeing sketched out.\n\nThis great affair was being discussed in a low voice, and the two heads\nat work touched each other: \"Let us begin by finding names. When one has\nthe names, one finds the subject.\"\n\n\"That is true. Dictate. I will write.\"\n\n\"Monsieur Dorimon.\"\n\n\"An independent gentleman?\"\n\n\"Of course.\"\n\n\"His daughter, Celestine.\"\n\n\"--tine. What next?\"\n\n\"Colonel Sainval.\"\n\n\"Sainval is stale. I should say Valsin.\"\n\nBeside the vaudeville aspirants, another group, which was also taking\nadvantage of the uproar to talk low, was discussing a duel. An old\nfellow of thirty was counselling a young one of eighteen, and explaining\nto him what sort of an adversary he had to deal with.\n\n\"The deuce! Look out for yourself. He is a fine swordsman. His play is\nneat. He has the attack, no wasted feints, wrist, dash, lightning, a\njust parade, mathematical parries, bigre! and he is left-handed.\"\n\nIn the angle opposite Grantaire, Joly and Bahorel were playing dominoes,\nand talking of love.\n\n\"You are in luck, that you are,\" Joly was saying. \"You have a mistress\nwho is always laughing.\"\n\n\"That is a fault of hers,\" returned Bahorel. \"One's mistress does wrong\nto laugh. That encourages one to deceive her. To see her gay removes\nyour remorse; if you see her sad, your conscience pricks you.\"\n\n\"Ingrate! a woman who laughs is such a good thing! And you never\nquarrel!\"\n\n\"That is because of the treaty which we have made. On forming our little\nHoly Alliance we assigned ourselves each our frontier, which we never\ncross. What is situated on the side of winter belongs to Vaud, on the\nside of the wind to Gex. Hence the peace.\"\n\n\"Peace is happiness digesting.\"\n\n\"And you, Jolllly, where do you stand in your entanglement with\nMamselle--you know whom I mean?\"\n\n\"She sulks at me with cruel patience.\"\n\n\"Yet you are a lover to soften the heart with gauntness.\"\n\n\"Alas!\"\n\n\"In your place, I would let her alone.\"\n\n\"That is easy enough to say.\"\n\n\"And to do. Is not her name Musichetta?\"\n\n\"Yes. Ah! my poor Bahorel, she is a superb girl, very literary, with\ntiny feet, little hands, she dresses well, and is white and dimpled,\nwith the eyes of a fortune-teller. I am wild over her.\"\n\n\"My dear fellow, then in order to please her, you must be elegant,\nand produce effects with your knees. Buy a good pair of trousers of\ndouble-milled cloth at Staub's. That will assist.\"\n\n\"At what price?\" shouted Grantaire.\n\nThe third corner was delivered up to a poetical discussion. Pagan\nmythology was giving battle to Christian mythology. The question was\nabout Olympus, whose part was taken by Jean Prouvaire, out of pure\nromanticism.\n\nJean Prouvaire was timid only in repose. Once excited, he burst forth,\na sort of mirth accentuated his enthusiasm, and he was at once both\nlaughing and lyric.\n\n\"Let us not insult the gods,\" said he. \"The gods may not have taken\ntheir departure. Jupiter does not impress me as dead. The gods are\ndreams, you say. Well, even in nature, such as it is to-day, after the\nflight of these dreams, we still find all the grand old pagan myths.\nSuch and such a mountain with the profile of a citadel, like the\nVignemale, for example, is still to me the headdress of Cybele; it has\nnot been proved to me that Pan does not come at night to breathe into\nthe hollow trunks of the willows, stopping up the holes in turn with his\nfingers, and I have always believed that Io had something to do with the\ncascade of Pissevache.\"\n\nIn the last corner, they were talking politics. The Charter which had\nbeen granted was getting roughly handled. Combeferre was upholding it\nweakly. Courfeyrac was energetically making a breach in it. On the table\nlay an unfortunate copy of the famous Touquet Charter. Courfeyrac had\nseized it, and was brandishing it, mingling with his arguments the\nrattling of this sheet of paper.\n\n\"In the first place, I won't have any kings; if it were only from an\neconomical point of view, I don't want any; a king is a parasite. One\ndoes not have kings gratis. Listen to this: the dearness of kings. At\nthe death of Francois I., the national debt of France amounted to an\nincome of thirty thousand livres; at the death of Louis XIV. it was two\nmilliards, six hundred millions, at twenty-eight livres the mark, which\nwas equivalent in 1760, according to Desmarets, to four milliards, five\nhundred millions, which would to-day be equivalent to twelve milliards.\nIn the second place, and no offence to Combeferre, a charter granted is\nbut a poor expedient of civilization. To save the transition, to soften\nthe passage, to deaden the shock, to cause the nation to pass insensibly\nfrom the monarchy to democracy by the practice of constitutional\nfictions,--what detestable reasons all those are! No! no! let us never\nenlighten the people with false daylight. Principles dwindle and pale\nin your constitutional cellar. No illegitimacy, no compromise, no grant\nfrom the king to the people. In all such grants there is an Article 14.\nBy the side of the hand which gives there is the claw which snatches\nback. I refuse your charter point-blank. A charter is a mask; the lie\nlurks beneath it. A people which accepts a charter abdicates. The law is\nonly the law when entire. No! no charter!\"\n\nIt was winter; a couple of fagots were crackling in the fireplace. This\nwas tempting, and Courfeyrac could not resist. He crumpled the poor\nTouquet Charter in his fist, and flung it in the fire. The paper\nflashed up. Combeferre watched the masterpiece of Louis XVIII. burn\nphilosophically, and contented himself with saying:--\n\n\"The charter metamorphosed into flame.\"\n\nAnd sarcasms, sallies, jests, that French thing which is called entrain,\nand that English thing which is called humor, good and bad taste,\ngood and bad reasons, all the wild pyrotechnics of dialogue, mounting\ntogether and crossing from all points of the room, produced a sort of\nmerry bombardment over their heads.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V--ENLARGEMENT OF HORIZON\n\nThe shocks of youthful minds among themselves have this admirable\nproperty, that one can never foresee the spark, nor divine the lightning\nflash. What will dart out presently? No one knows. The burst of laughter\nstarts from a tender feeling.\n\nAt the moment of jest, the serious makes its entry. Impulses depend on\nthe first chance word. The spirit of each is sovereign, jest suffices\nto open the field to the unexpected. These are conversations with\nabrupt turns, in which the perspective changes suddenly. Chance is the\nstage-manager of such conversations.\n\nA severe thought, starting oddly from a clash of words, suddenly\ntraversed the conflict of quips in which Grantaire, Bahorel, Prouvaire,\nBossuet, Combeferre, and Courfeyrac were confusedly fencing.\n\nHow does a phrase crop up in a dialogue? Whence comes it that it\nsuddenly impresses itself on the attention of those who hear it? We\nhave just said, that no one knows anything about it. In the midst of the\nuproar, Bossuet all at once terminated some apostrophe to Combeferre,\nwith this date:--\n\n\"June 18th, 1815, Waterloo.\"\n\nAt this name of Waterloo, Marius, who was leaning his elbows on a table,\nbeside a glass of water, removed his wrist from beneath his chin, and\nbegan to gaze fixedly at the audience.\n\n\"Pardieu!\" exclaimed Courfeyrac (\"Parbleu\" was falling into disuse\nat this period), \"that number 18 is strange and strikes me. It is\nBonaparte's fatal number. Place Louis in front and Brumaire behind, you\nhave the whole destiny of the man, with this significant peculiarity,\nthat the end treads close on the heels of the commencement.\"\n\nEnjolras, who had remained mute up to that point, broke the silence and\naddressed this remark to Combeferre:--\n\n\"You mean to say, the crime and the expiation.\"\n\nThis word crime overpassed the measure of what Marius, who was already\ngreatly agitated by the abrupt evocation of Waterloo, could accept.\n\nHe rose, walked slowly to the map of France spread out on the wall, and\nat whose base an island was visible in a separate compartment, laid his\nfinger on this compartment and said:--\n\n\"Corsica, a little island which has rendered France very great.\"\n\nThis was like a breath of icy air. All ceased talking. They felt that\nsomething was on the point of occurring.\n\nBahorel, replying to Bossuet, was just assuming an attitude of the torso\nto which he was addicted. He gave it up to listen.\n\nEnjolras, whose blue eye was not fixed on any one, and who seemed to be\ngazing at space, replied, without glancing at Marius:--\n\n\"France needs no Corsica to be great. France is great because she is\nFrance. Quia nomina leo.\"\n\nMarius felt no desire to retreat; he turned towards Enjolras, and his\nvoice burst forth with a vibration which came from a quiver of his very\nbeing:--\n\n\"God forbid that I should diminish France! But amalgamating Napoleon\nwith her is not diminishing her. Come! let us argue the question. I am\na new comer among you, but I will confess that you amaze me. Where do we\nstand? Who are we? Who are you? Who am I? Let us come to an explanation\nabout the Emperor. I hear you say Buonaparte, accenting the u like the\nRoyalists. I warn you that my grandfather does better still; he\nsays Buonaparte'. I thought you were young men. Where, then, is your\nenthusiasm? And what are you doing with it? Whom do you admire, if you\ndo not admire the Emperor? And what more do you want? If you will\nhave none of that great man, what great men would you like? He had\neverything. He was complete. He had in his brain the sum of human\nfaculties. He made codes like Justinian, he dictated like Caesar, his\nconversation was mingled with the lightning-flash of Pascal, with the\nthunderclap of Tacitus, he made history and he wrote it, his bulletins\nare Iliads, he combined the cipher of Newton with the metaphor of\nMahomet, he left behind him in the East words as great as the pyramids,\nat Tilsit he taught Emperors majesty, at the Academy of Sciences he\nreplied to Laplace, in the Council of State be held his own against\nMerlin, he gave a soul to the geometry of the first, and to the\nchicanery of the last, he was a legist with the attorneys and sidereal\nwith the astronomers; like Cromwell blowing out one of two candles, he\nwent to the Temple to bargain for a curtain tassel; he saw everything;\nhe knew everything; which did not prevent him from laughing\ngood-naturedly beside the cradle of his little child; and all at once,\nfrightened Europe lent an ear, armies put themselves in motion, parks of\nartillery rumbled, pontoons stretched over the rivers, clouds of cavalry\ngalloped in the storm, cries, trumpets, a trembling of thrones in every\ndirection, the frontiers of kingdoms oscillated on the map, the sound\nof a superhuman sword was heard, as it was drawn from its sheath; they\nbeheld him, him, rise erect on the horizon with a blazing brand in his\nhand, and a glow in his eyes, unfolding amid the thunder, his two wings,\nthe grand army and the old guard, and he was the archangel of war!\"\n\nAll held their peace, and Enjolras bowed his head. Silence always\nproduces somewhat the effect of acquiescence, of the enemy being driven\nto the wall. Marius continued with increased enthusiasm, and almost\nwithout pausing for breath:--\n\n\"Let us be just, my friends! What a splendid destiny for a nation to be\nthe Empire of such an Emperor, when that nation is France and when it\nadds its own genius to the genius of that man! To appear and to reign,\nto march and to triumph, to have for halting-places all capitals, to\ntake his grenadiers and to make kings of them, to decree the falls of\ndynasties, and to transfigure Europe at the pace of a charge; to make\nyou feel that when you threaten you lay your hand on the hilt of the\nsword of God; to follow in a single man, Hannibal, Caesar, Charlemagne;\nto be the people of some one who mingles with your dawns the startling\nannouncement of a battle won, to have the cannon of the Invalides to\nrouse you in the morning, to hurl into abysses of light prodigious words\nwhich flame forever, Marengo, Arcola, Austerlitz, Jena, Wagram! To cause\nconstellations of victories to flash forth at each instant from the\nzenith of the centuries, to make the French Empire a pendant to the\nRoman Empire, to be the great nation and to give birth to the grand\narmy, to make its legions fly forth over all the earth, as a mountain\nsends out its eagles on all sides to conquer, to dominate, to strike\nwith lightning, to be in Europe a sort of nation gilded through glory,\nto sound athwart the centuries a trumpet-blast of Titans, to conquer\nthe world twice, by conquest and by dazzling, that is sublime; and what\ngreater thing is there?\"\n\n\"To be free,\" said Combeferre.\n\nMarius lowered his head in his turn; that cold and simple word had\ntraversed his epic effusion like a blade of steel, and he felt it\nvanishing within him. When he raised his eyes, Combeferre was no longer\nthere. Probably satisfied with his reply to the apotheosis, he had\njust taken his departure, and all, with the exception of Enjolras,\nhad followed him. The room had been emptied. Enjolras, left alone with\nMarius, was gazing gravely at him. Marius, however, having rallied his\nideas to some extent, did not consider himself beaten; there lingered in\nhim a trace of inward fermentation which was on the point, no doubt, of\ntranslating itself into syllogisms arrayed against Enjolras, when all of\na sudden, they heard some one singing on the stairs as he went. It was\nCombeferre, and this is what he was singing:--\n\n               \"Si Cesar m'avait donne[25]\n                 La gloire et la guerre,\n               Et qu'il me fallait quitter\n                 L'amour de ma mere,\n               Je dirais au grand Cesar:\n                 Reprends ton sceptre et ton char,\n               J'aime mieux ma mere, o gue!\n                 J'aime mieux ma mere!\"\n\nThe wild and tender accents with which Combeferre sang communicated to\nthis couplet a sort of strange grandeur. Marius, thoughtfully, and\nwith his eyes diked on the ceiling, repeated almost mechanically: \"My\nmother?--\"\n\nAt that moment, he felt Enjolras' hand on his shoulder.\n\n\"Citizen,\" said Enjolras to him, \"my mother is the Republic.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI--RES ANGUSTA\n\nThat evening left Marius profoundly shaken, and with a melancholy shadow\nin his soul. He felt what the earth may possibly feel, at the moment\nwhen it is torn open with the iron, in order that grain may be deposited\nwithin it; it feels only the wound; the quiver of the germ and the joy\nof the fruit only arrive later.\n\nMarius was gloomy. He had but just acquired a faith; must he then reject\nit already? He affirmed to himself that he would not. He declared to\nhimself that he would not doubt, and he began to doubt in spite of\nhimself. To stand between two religions, from one of which you have\nnot as yet emerged, and another into which you have not yet entered, is\nintolerable; and twilight is pleasing only to bat-like souls. Marius\nwas clear-eyed, and he required the true light. The half-lights of doubt\npained him. Whatever may have been his desire to remain where he was,\nhe could not halt there, he was irresistibly constrained to continue, to\nadvance, to examine, to think, to march further. Whither would this lead\nhim? He feared, after having taken so many steps which had brought him\nnearer to his father, to now take a step which should estrange him from\nthat father. His discomfort was augmented by all the reflections which\noccurred to him. An escarpment rose around him. He was in accord neither\nwith his grandfather nor with his friends; daring in the eyes of\nthe one, he was behind the times in the eyes of the others, and he\nrecognized the fact that he was doubly isolated, on the side of age and\non the side of youth. He ceased to go to the Cafe Musain.\n\nIn the troubled state of his conscience, he no longer thought of\ncertain serious sides of existence. The realities of life do not allow\nthemselves to be forgotten. They soon elbowed him abruptly.\n\nOne morning, the proprietor of the hotel entered Marius' room and said\nto him:--\n\n\"Monsieur Courfeyrac answered for you.\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"But I must have my money.\"\n\n\"Request Courfeyrac to come and talk with me,\" said Marius.\n\nCourfeyrac having made his appearance, the host left them. Marius then\ntold him what it had not before occurred to him to relate, that he was\nthe same as alone in the world, and had no relatives.\n\n\"What is to become of you?\" said Courfeyrac.\n\n\"I do not know in the least,\" replied Marius.\n\n\"What are you going to do?\"\n\n\"I do not know.\"\n\n\"Have you any money?\"\n\n\"Fifteen francs.\"\n\n\"Do you want me to lend you some?\"\n\n\"Never.\"\n\n\"Have you clothes?\"\n\n\"Here is what I have.\"\n\n\"Have you trinkets?\"\n\n\"A watch.\"\n\n\"Silver?\"\n\n\"Gold; here it is.\"\n\n\"I know a clothes-dealer who will take your frock-coat and a pair of\ntrousers.\"\n\n\"That is good.\"\n\n\"You will then have only a pair of trousers, a waistcoat, a hat and a\ncoat.\"\n\n\"And my boots.\"\n\n\"What! you will not go barefoot? What opulence!\"\n\n\"That will be enough.\"\n\n\"I know a watchmaker who will buy your watch.\"\n\n\"That is good.\"\n\n\"No; it is not good. What will you do after that?\"\n\n\"Whatever is necessary. Anything honest, that is to say.\"\n\n\"Do you know English?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Do you know German?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"So much the worse.\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"Because one of my friends, a publisher, is getting up a sort of an\nencyclopaedia, for which you might have translated English or German\narticles. It is badly paid work, but one can live by it.\"\n\n\"I will learn English and German.\"\n\n\"And in the meanwhile?\"\n\n\"In the meanwhile I will live on my clothes and my watch.\"\n\nThe clothes-dealer was sent for. He paid twenty francs for the cast-off\ngarments. They went to the watchmaker's. He bought the watch for\nforty-five francs.\n\n\"That is not bad,\" said Marius to Courfeyrac, on their return to the\nhotel, \"with my fifteen francs, that makes eighty.\"\n\n\"And the hotel bill?\" observed Courfeyrac.\n\n\"Hello, I had forgotten that,\" said Marius.\n\nThe landlord presented his bill, which had to be paid on the spot. It\namounted to seventy francs.\n\n\"I have ten francs left,\" said Marius.\n\n\"The deuce,\" exclaimed Courfeyrac, \"you will eat up five francs while\nyou are learning English, and five while learning German. That will be\nswallowing a tongue very fast, or a hundred sous very slowly.\"\n\nIn the meantime Aunt Gillenormand, a rather good-hearted person at\nbottom in difficulties, had finally hunted up Marius' abode.\n\nOne morning, on his return from the law-school, Marius found a letter\nfrom his aunt, and the sixty pistoles, that is to say, six hundred\nfrancs in gold, in a sealed box.\n\nMarius sent back the thirty louis to his aunt, with a respectful letter,\nin which he stated that he had sufficient means of subsistence and that\nhe should be able thenceforth to supply all his needs. At that moment,\nhe had three francs left.\n\nHis aunt did not inform his grandfather of this refusal for fear of\nexasperating him. Besides, had he not said: \"Let me never hear the name\nof that blood-drinker again!\"\n\nMarius left the hotel de la Porte Saint-Jacques, as he did not wish to\nrun in debt there.\n\n\n\n\nBOOK FIFTH.--THE EXCELLENCE OF MISFORTUNE\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I--MARIUS INDIGENT\n\n[Illustration: Excellence of Misfortune  3b5-1-misfortune]\n\n\nLife became hard for Marius. It was nothing to eat his clothes and his\nwatch. He ate of that terrible, inexpressible thing that is called de la\nvache enrage; that is to say, he endured great hardships and privations.\nA terrible thing it is, containing days without bread, nights without\nsleep, evenings without a candle, a hearth without a fire, weeks without\nwork, a future without hope, a coat out at the elbows, an old hat which\nevokes the laughter of young girls, a door which one finds locked on one\nat night because one's rent is not paid, the insolence of the porter\nand the cook-shop man, the sneers of neighbors, humiliations, dignity\ntrampled on, work of whatever nature accepted, disgusts, bitterness,\ndespondency. Marius learned how all this is eaten, and how such are\noften the only things which one has to devour. At that moment of his\nexistence when a man needs his pride, because he needs love, he felt\nthat he was jeered at because he was badly dressed, and ridiculous\nbecause he was poor. At the age when youth swells the heart with\nimperial pride, he dropped his eyes more than once on his dilapidated\nboots, and he knew the unjust shame and the poignant blushes of\nwretchedness. Admirable and terrible trial from which the feeble emerge\nbase, from which the strong emerge sublime. A crucible into which\ndestiny casts a man, whenever it desires a scoundrel or a demi-god.\n\nFor many great deeds are performed in petty combats. There are instances\nof bravery ignored and obstinate, which defend themselves step by\nstep in that fatal onslaught of necessities and turpitudes. Noble and\nmysterious triumphs which no eye beholds, which are requited with no\nrenown, which are saluted with no trumpet blast. Life, misfortune,\nisolation, abandonment, poverty, are the fields of battle which have\ntheir heroes; obscure heroes, who are, sometimes, grander than the\nheroes who win renown.\n\nFirm and rare natures are thus created; misery, almost always a\nstep-mother, is sometimes a mother; destitution gives birth to might of\nsoul and spirit; distress is the nurse of pride; unhappiness is a good\nmilk for the magnanimous.\n\nThere came a moment in Marius' life, when he swept his own landing, when\nhe bought his sou's worth of Brie cheese at the fruiterer's, when he\nwaited until twilight had fallen to slip into the baker's and purchase\na loaf, which he carried off furtively to his attic as though he had\nstolen it. Sometimes there could be seen gliding into the butcher's shop\non the corner, in the midst of the bantering cooks who elbowed him, an\nawkward young man, carrying big books under his arm, who had a timid yet\nangry air, who, on entering, removed his hat from a brow whereon stood\ndrops of perspiration, made a profound bow to the butcher's astonished\nwife, asked for a mutton cutlet, paid six or seven sous for it, wrapped\nit up in a paper, put it under his arm, between two books, and went\naway. It was Marius. On this cutlet, which he cooked for himself, he\nlived for three days.\n\nOn the first day he ate the meat, on the second he ate the fat, on the\nthird he gnawed the bone. Aunt Gillenormand made repeated attempts, and\nsent him the sixty pistoles several times. Marius returned them on every\noccasion, saying that he needed nothing.\n\nHe was still in mourning for his father when the revolution which we\nhave just described was effected within him. From that time forth, he\nhad not put off his black garments. But his garments were quitting him.\nThe day came when he had no longer a coat. The trousers would go next.\nWhat was to be done? Courfeyrac, to whom he had, on his side, done some\ngood turns, gave him an old coat. For thirty sous, Marius got it turned\nby some porter or other, and it was a new coat. But this coat was green.\nThen Marius ceased to go out until after nightfall. This made his coat\nblack. As he wished always to appear in mourning, he clothed himself\nwith the night.\n\nIn spite of all this, he got admitted to practice as a lawyer. He was\nsupposed to live in Courfeyrac's room, which was decent, and where\na certain number of law-books backed up and completed by several\ndilapidated volumes of romance, passed as the library required by the\nregulations. He had his letters addressed to Courfeyrac's quarters.\n\nWhen Marius became a lawyer, he informed his grandfather of the fact\nin a letter which was cold but full of submission and respect. M.\nGillenormand trembled as he took the letter, read it, tore it in four\npieces, and threw it into the waste-basket. Two or three days later,\nMademoiselle Gillenormand heard her father, who was alone in his room,\ntalking aloud to himself. He always did this whenever he was greatly\nagitated. She listened, and the old man was saying: \"If you were not a\nfool, you would know that one cannot be a baron and a lawyer at the same\ntime.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II--MARIUS POOR\n\nIt is the same with wretchedness as with everything else. It ends by\nbecoming bearable. It finally assumes a form, and adjusts itself. One\nvegetates, that is to say, one develops in a certain meagre fashion,\nwhich is, however, sufficient for life. This is the mode in which the\nexistence of Marius Pontmercy was arranged:\n\nHe had passed the worst straits; the narrow pass was opening out a\nlittle in front of him. By dint of toil, perseverance, courage, and\nwill, he had managed to draw from his work about seven hundred francs a\nyear. He had learned German and English; thanks to Courfeyrac, who had\nput him in communication with his friend the publisher, Marius filled\nthe modest post of utility man in the literature of the publishing\nhouse. He drew up prospectuses, translated newspapers, annotated\neditions, compiled biographies, etc.; net product, year in and year\nout, seven hundred francs. He lived on it. How? Not so badly. We will\nexplain.\n\nMarius occupied in the Gorbeau house, for an annual sum of thirty\nfrancs, a den minus a fireplace, called a cabinet, which contained only\nthe most indispensable articles of furniture. This furniture belonged\nto him. He gave three francs a month to the old principal tenant to come\nand sweep his hole, and to bring him a little hot water every morning,\na fresh egg, and a penny roll. He breakfasted on this egg and roll. His\nbreakfast varied in cost from two to four sous, according as eggs\nwere dear or cheap. At six o'clock in the evening he descended the\nRue Saint-Jacques to dine at Rousseau's, opposite Basset's, the\nstamp-dealer's, on the corner of the Rue des Mathurins. He ate no soup.\nHe took a six-sou plate of meat, a half-portion of vegetables for three\nsous, and a three-sou dessert. For three sous he got as much bread as\nhe wished. As for wine, he drank water. When he paid at the desk\nwhere Madam Rousseau, at that period still plump and rosy majestically\npresided, he gave a sou to the waiter, and Madam Rousseau gave him a\nsmile. Then he went away. For sixteen sous he had a smile and a dinner.\n\nThis Restaurant Rousseau, where so few bottles and so many water carafes\nwere emptied, was a calming potion rather than a restaurant. It no\nlonger exists. The proprietor had a fine nickname: he was called\nRousseau the Aquatic.\n\nThus, breakfast four sous, dinner sixteen sous; his food cost him twenty\nsous a day; which made three hundred and sixty-five francs a year. Add\nthe thirty francs for rent, and the thirty-six francs to the old woman,\nplus a few trifling expenses; for four hundred and fifty francs, Marius\nwas fed, lodged, and waited on. His clothing cost him a hundred francs,\nhis linen fifty francs, his washing fifty francs; the whole did not\nexceed six hundred and fifty francs. He was rich. He sometimes lent ten\nfrancs to a friend. Courfeyrac had once been able to borrow sixty francs\nof him. As far as fire was concerned, as Marius had no fireplace, he had\n\"simplified matters.\"\n\nMarius always had two complete suits of clothes, the one old, \"for every\nday\"; the other, brand new for special occasions. Both were black. He\nhad but three shirts, one on his person, the second in the commode, and\nthe third in the washerwoman's hands. He renewed them as they wore out.\nThey were always ragged, which caused him to button his coat to the\nchin.\n\nIt had required years for Marius to attain to this flourishing\ncondition. Hard years; difficult, some of them, to traverse, others to\nclimb. Marius had not failed for a single day. He had endured everything\nin the way of destitution; he had done everything except contract debts.\nHe did himself the justice to say that he had never owed any one a sou.\nA debt was, to him, the beginning of slavery. He even said to himself,\nthat a creditor is worse than a master; for the master possesses only\nyour person, a creditor possesses your dignity and can administer to\nit a box on the ear. Rather than borrow, he went without food. He had\npassed many a day fasting. Feeling that all extremes meet, and that,\nif one is not on one's guard, lowered fortunes may lead to baseness of\nsoul, he kept a jealous watch on his pride. Such and such a formality\nor action, which, in any other situation would have appeared merely a\ndeference to him, now seemed insipidity, and he nerved himself against\nit. His face wore a sort of severe flush. He was timid even to rudeness.\n\nDuring all these trials he had felt himself encouraged and even\nuplifted, at times, by a secret force that he possessed within himself.\nThe soul aids the body, and at certain moments, raises it. It is the\nonly bird which bears up its own cage.\n\nBesides his father's name, another name was graven in Marius' heart,\nthe name of Thenardier. Marius, with his grave and enthusiastic nature,\nsurrounded with a sort of aureole the man to whom, in his thoughts,\nhe owed his father's life,--that intrepid sergeant who had saved the\ncolonel amid the bullets and the cannon-balls of Waterloo. He never\nseparated the memory of this man from the memory of his father, and\nhe associated them in his veneration. It was a sort of worship in two\nsteps, with the grand altar for the colonel and the lesser one for\nThenardier. What redoubled the tenderness of his gratitude towards\nThenardier, was the idea of the distress into which he knew that\nThenardier had fallen, and which had engulfed the latter. Marius had\nlearned at Montfermeil of the ruin and bankruptcy of the unfortunate\ninn-keeper. Since that time, he had made unheard-of efforts to find\ntraces of him and to reach him in that dark abyss of misery in which\nThenardier had disappeared. Marius had beaten the whole country; he\nhad gone to Chelles, to Bondy, to Gourney, to Nogent, to Lagny. He had\npersisted for three years, expending in these explorations the little\nmoney which he had laid by. No one had been able to give him any news of\nThenardier: he was supposed to have gone abroad. His creditors had also\nsought him, with less love than Marius, but with as much assiduity, and\nhad not been able to lay their hands on him. Marius blamed himself, and\nwas almost angry with himself for his lack of success in his researches.\nIt was the only debt left him by the colonel, and Marius made it a\nmatter of honor to pay it. \"What,\" he thought, \"when my father lay dying\non the field of battle, did Thenardier contrive to find him amid the\nsmoke and the grape-shot, and bear him off on his shoulders, and yet he\nowed him nothing, and I, who owe so much to Thenardier, cannot join him\nin this shadow where he is lying in the pangs of death, and in my\nturn bring him back from death to life! Oh! I will find him!\" To find\nThenardier, in fact, Marius would have given one of his arms, to rescue\nhim from his misery, he would have sacrificed all his blood. To see\nThenardier, to render Thenardier some service, to say to him: \"You do\nnot know me; well, I do know you! Here I am. Dispose of me!\" This was\nMarius' sweetest and most magnificent dream.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III--MARIUS GROWN UP\n\nAt this epoch, Marius was twenty years of age. It was three years since\nhe had left his grandfather. Both parties had remained on the same\nterms, without attempting to approach each other, and without seeking to\nsee each other. Besides, what was the use of seeing each other? Marius\nwas the brass vase, while Father Gillenormand was the iron pot.\n\nWe admit that Marius was mistaken as to his grandfather's heart. He had\nimagined that M. Gillenormand had never loved him, and that that crusty,\nharsh, and smiling old fellow who cursed, shouted, and stormed\nand brandished his cane, cherished for him, at the most, only that\naffection, which is at once slight and severe, of the dotards of comedy.\nMarius was in error. There are fathers who do not love their children;\nthere exists no grandfather who does not adore his grandson. At bottom,\nas we have said, M. Gillenormand idolized Marius. He idolized him after\nhis own fashion, with an accompaniment of snappishness and boxes on the\near; but, this child once gone, he felt a black void in his heart;\nhe would allow no one to mention the child to him, and all the while\nsecretly regretted that he was so well obeyed. At first, he hoped that\nthis Buonapartist, this Jacobin, this terrorist, this Septembrist, would\nreturn. But the weeks passed by, years passed; to M. Gillenormand's\ngreat despair, the \"blood-drinker\" did not make his appearance. \"I could\nnot do otherwise than turn him out,\" said the grandfather to himself,\nand he asked himself: \"If the thing were to do over again, would I do\nit?\" His pride instantly answered \"yes,\" but his aged head, which he\nshook in silence, replied sadly \"no.\" He had his hours of depression.\nHe missed Marius. Old men need affection as they need the sun. It is\nwarmth. Strong as his nature was, the absence of Marius had wrought some\nchange in him. Nothing in the world could have induced him to take a\nstep towards \"that rogue\"; but he suffered. He never inquired about him,\nbut he thought of him incessantly. He lived in the Marais in a more and\nmore retired manner; he was still merry and violent as of old, but\nhis merriment had a convulsive harshness, and his violences always\nterminated in a sort of gentle and gloomy dejection. He sometimes said:\n\"Oh! if he only would return, what a good box on the ear I would give\nhim!\"\n\nAs for his aunt, she thought too little to love much; Marius was no\nlonger for her much more than a vague black form; and she eventually\ncame to occupy herself with him much less than with the cat or the\nparoquet which she probably had. What augmented Father Gillenormand's\nsecret suffering was, that he locked it all up within his breast, and\ndid not allow its existence to be divined. His sorrow was like those\nrecently invented furnaces which consume their own smoke. It sometimes\nhappened that officious busybodies spoke to him of Marius, and asked\nhim: \"What is your grandson doing?\" \"What has become of him?\" The old\nbourgeois replied with a sigh, that he was a sad case, and giving a\nfillip to his cuff, if he wished to appear gay: \"Monsieur le Baron de\nPontmercy is practising pettifogging in some corner or other.\"\n\nWhile the old man regretted, Marius applauded himself. As is the case\nwith all good-hearted people, misfortune had eradicated his bitterness.\nHe only thought of M. Gillenormand in an amiable light, but he had set\nhis mind on not receiving anything more from the man who had been\nunkind to his father. This was the mitigated translation of his first\nindignation. Moreover, he was happy at having suffered, and at suffering\nstill. It was for his father's sake. The hardness of his life satisfied\nand pleased him. He said to himself with a sort of joy that--it was\ncertainly the least he could do; that it was an expiation;--that, had\nit not been for that, he would have been punished in some other way and\nlater on for his impious indifference towards his father, and such a\nfather! that it would not have been just that his father should have all\nthe suffering, and he none of it; and that, in any case, what were his\ntoils and his destitution compared with the colonel's heroic life? that,\nin short, the only way for him to approach his father and resemble him,\nwas to be brave in the face of indigence, as the other had been valiant\nbefore the enemy; and that that was, no doubt, what the colonel had\nmeant to imply by the words: \"He will be worthy of it.\" Words which\nMarius continued to wear, not on his breast, since the colonel's writing\nhad disappeared, but in his heart.\n\nAnd then, on the day when his grandfather had turned him out of doors,\nhe had been only a child, now he was a man. He felt it. Misery, we\nrepeat, had been good for him. Poverty in youth, when it succeeds, has\nthis magnificent property about it, that it turns the whole will towards\neffort, and the whole soul towards aspiration. Poverty instantly lays\nmaterial life bare and renders it hideous; hence inexpressible bounds\ntowards the ideal life. The wealthy young man has a hundred coarse and\nbrilliant distractions, horse races, hunting, dogs, tobacco, gaming,\ngood repasts, and all the rest of it; occupations for the baser side\nof the soul, at the expense of the loftier and more delicate sides.\nThe poor young man wins his bread with difficulty; he eats; when he has\neaten, he has nothing more but meditation. He goes to the spectacles\nwhich God furnishes gratis; he gazes at the sky, space, the stars,\nflowers, children, the humanity among which he is suffering, the\ncreation amid which he beams. He gazes so much on humanity that he\nperceives its soul, he gazes upon creation to such an extent that he\nbeholds God. He dreams, he feels himself great; he dreams on, and feels\nhimself tender. From the egotism of the man who suffers he passes to the\ncompassion of the man who meditates. An admirable sentiment breaks forth\nin him, forgetfulness of self and pity for all. As he thinks of the\ninnumerable enjoyments which nature offers, gives, and lavishes to souls\nwhich stand open, and refuses to souls that are closed, he comes to\npity, he the millionnaire of the mind, the millionnaire of money. All\nhatred departs from his heart, in proportion as light penetrates his\nspirit. And is he unhappy? No. The misery of a young man is never\nmiserable. The first young lad who comes to hand, however poor he may\nbe, with his strength, his health, his rapid walk, his brilliant eyes,\nhis warmly circulating blood, his black hair, his red lips, his white\nteeth, his pure breath, will always arouse the envy of an aged emperor.\nAnd then, every morning, he sets himself afresh to the task of earning\nhis bread; and while his hands earn his bread, his dorsal column\ngains pride, his brain gathers ideas. His task finished, he returns to\nineffable ecstasies, to contemplation, to joys; he beholds his feet set\nin afflictions, in obstacles, on the pavement, in the nettles, sometimes\nin the mire; his head in the light. He is firm, serene, gentle, peaceful,\nattentive, serious, content with little, kindly; and he thanks God for\nhaving bestowed on him those two forms of riches which many a rich\nman lacks: work, which makes him free; and thought, which makes him\ndignified.\n\nThis is what had happened with Marius. To tell the truth, he inclined a\nlittle too much to the side of contemplation. From the day when he had\nsucceeded in earning his living with some approach to certainty, he had\nstopped, thinking it good to be poor, and retrenching time from his work\nto give to thought; that is to say, he sometimes passed entire days\nin meditation, absorbed, engulfed, like a visionary, in the mute\nvoluptuousness of ecstasy and inward radiance. He had thus propounded\nthe problem of his life: to toil as little as possible at material\nlabor, in order to toil as much as possible at the labor which is\nimpalpable; in other words, to bestow a few hours on real life, and to\ncast the rest to the infinite. As he believed that he lacked nothing, he\ndid not perceive that contemplation, thus understood, ends by becoming\none of the forms of idleness; that he was contenting himself with\nconquering the first necessities of life, and that he was resting from\nhis labors too soon.\n\nIt was evident that, for this energetic and enthusiastic nature, this\ncould only be a transitory state, and that, at the first shock against\nthe inevitable complications of destiny, Marius would awaken.\n\nIn the meantime, although he was a lawyer, and whatever Father\nGillenormand thought about the matter, he was not practising, he was\nnot even pettifogging. Meditation had turned him aside from pleading. To\nhaunt attorneys, to follow the court, to hunt up cases--what a bore! Why\nshould he do it? He saw no reason for changing the manner of gaining his\nlivelihood! The obscure and ill-paid publishing establishment had come\nto mean for him a sure source of work which did not involve too much\nlabor, as we have explained, and which sufficed for his wants.\n\nOne of the publishers for whom he worked, M. Magimel, I think, offered\nto take him into his own house, to lodge him well, to furnish him with\nregular occupation, and to give him fifteen hundred francs a year. To be\nwell lodged! Fifteen hundred francs! No doubt. But renounce his liberty!\nBe on fixed wages! A sort of hired man of letters! According to Marius'\nopinion, if he accepted, his position would become both better and worse\nat the same time, he acquired comfort, and lost his dignity; it was a\nfine and complete unhappiness converted into a repulsive and ridiculous\nstate of torture: something like the case of a blind man who should\nrecover the sight of one eye. He refused.\n\nMarius dwelt in solitude. Owing to his taste for remaining outside of\neverything, and through having been too much alarmed, he had not entered\ndecidedly into the group presided over by Enjolras. They had remained\ngood friends; they were ready to assist each other on occasion in every\npossible way; but nothing more. Marius had two friends: one young,\nCourfeyrac; and one old, M. Mabeuf. He inclined more to the old man.\nIn the first place, he owed to him the revolution which had taken\nplace within him; to him he was indebted for having known and loved his\nfather. \"He operated on me for a cataract,\" he said.\n\nThe churchwarden had certainly played a decisive part.\n\nIt was not, however, that M. Mabeuf had been anything but the calm and\nimpassive agent of Providence in this connection. He had enlightened\nMarius by chance and without being aware of the fact, as does a candle\nwhich some one brings; he had been the candle and not the some one.\n\nAs for Marius' inward political revolution, M. Mabeuf was totally\nincapable of comprehending it, of willing or of directing it.\n\nAs we shall see M. Mabeuf again, later on, a few words will not be\nsuperfluous.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV--M. MABEUF\n\nOn the day when M. Mabeuf said to Marius: \"Certainly I approve of\npolitical opinions,\" he expressed the real state of his mind. All\npolitical opinions were matters of indifference to him, and he approved\nthem all, without distinction, provided they left him in peace, as the\nGreeks called the Furies \"the beautiful, the good, the charming,\" the\nEumenides. M. Mabeuf's political opinion consisted in a passionate love\nfor plants, and, above all, for books. Like all the rest of the world,\nhe possessed the termination in ist, without which no one could exist at\nthat time, but he was neither a Royalist, a Bonapartist, a Chartist,\nan Orleanist, nor an Anarchist; he was a bouquinist, a collector of old\nbooks. He did not understand how men could busy themselves with\nhating each other because of silly stuff like the charter, democracy,\nlegitimacy, monarchy, the republic, etc., when there were in the world\nall sorts of mosses, grasses, and shrubs which they might be looking at,\nand heaps of folios, and even of 32mos, which they might turn over. He\ntook good care not to become useless; having books did not prevent his\nreading, being a botanist did not prevent his being a gardener. When\nhe made Pontmercy's acquaintance, this sympathy had existed between the\ncolonel and himself--that what the colonel did for flowers, he did for\nfruits. M. Mabeuf had succeeded in producing seedling pears as savory\nas the pears of St. Germain; it is from one of his combinations,\napparently, that the October Mirabelle, now celebrated and no less\nperfumed than the summer Mirabelle, owes its origin. He went to mass\nrather from gentleness than from piety, and because, as he loved the\nfaces of men, but hated their noise, he found them assembled and silent\nonly in church. Feeling that he must be something in the State, he had\nchosen the career of warden. However, he had never succeeded in loving\nany woman as much as a tulip bulb, nor any man as much as an Elzevir.\nHe had long passed sixty, when, one day, some one asked him: \"Have you\nnever been married?\" \"I have forgotten,\" said he. When it sometimes\nhappened to him--and to whom does it not happen?--to say: \"Oh! if I were\nonly rich!\" it was not when ogling a pretty girl, as was the case with\nFather Gillenormand, but when contemplating an old book. He lived alone\nwith an old housekeeper. He was somewhat gouty, and when he was asleep,\nhis aged fingers, stiffened with rheumatism, lay crooked up in the folds\nof his sheets. He had composed and published a Flora of the Environs of\nCauteretz, with colored plates, a work which enjoyed a tolerable\nmeasure of esteem and which sold well. People rang his bell, in the Rue\nMesieres, two or three times a day, to ask for it. He drew as much as\ntwo thousand francs a year from it; this constituted nearly the whole of\nhis fortune. Although poor, he had had the talent to form for himself,\nby dint of patience, privations, and time, a precious collection of rare\ncopies of every sort. He never went out without a book under his arm,\nand he often returned with two. The sole decoration of the four rooms\non the ground floor, which composed his lodgings, consisted of framed\nherbariums, and engravings of the old masters. The sight of a sword or\na gun chilled his blood. He had never approached a cannon in his life,\neven at the Invalides. He had a passable stomach, a brother who was a\ncure, perfectly white hair, no teeth, either in his mouth or his mind, a\ntrembling in every limb, a Picard accent, an infantile laugh, the air of\nan old sheep, and he was easily frightened. Add to this, that he had no\nother friendship, no other acquaintance among the living, than an old\nbookseller of the Porte-Saint-Jacques, named Royal. His dream was to\nnaturalize indigo in France.\n\nHis servant was also a sort of innocent. The poor good old woman was a\nspinster. Sultan, her cat, which might have mewed Allegri's miserere in\nthe Sixtine Chapel, had filled her heart and sufficed for the quantity\nof passion which existed in her. None of her dreams had ever proceeded\nas far as man. She had never been able to get further than her cat. Like\nhim, she had a mustache. Her glory consisted in her caps, which were\nalways white. She passed her time, on Sundays, after mass, in counting\nover the linen in her chest, and in spreading out on her bed the dresses\nin the piece which she bought and never had made up. She knew how to\nread. M. Mabeuf had nicknamed her Mother Plutarque.\n\nM. Mabeuf had taken a fancy to Marius, because Marius, being young and\ngentle, warmed his age without startling his timidity. Youth combined\nwith gentleness produces on old people the effect of the sun without\nwind. When Marius was saturated with military glory, with gunpowder,\nwith marches and countermarches, and with all those prodigious battles\nin which his father had given and received such tremendous blows of the\nsword, he went to see M. Mabeuf, and M. Mabeuf talked to him of his hero\nfrom the point of view of flowers.\n\nHis brother the cure died about 1830, and almost immediately, as when\nthe night is drawing on, the whole horizon grew dark for M. Mabeuf. A\nnotary's failure deprived him of the sum of ten thousand francs, which\nwas all that he possessed in his brother's right and his own. The\nRevolution of July brought a crisis to publishing. In a period of\nembarrassment, the first thing which does not sell is a Flora. The Flora\nof the Environs of Cauteretz stopped short. Weeks passed by without a\nsingle purchaser. Sometimes M. Mabeuf started at the sound of the bell.\n\"Monsieur,\" said Mother Plutarque sadly, \"it is the water-carrier.\"\nIn short, one day, M. Mabeuf quitted the Rue Mesieres, abdicated the\nfunctions of warden, gave up Saint-Sulpice, sold not a part of his\nbooks, but of his prints,--that to which he was the least attached,--and\ninstalled himself in a little house on the Rue Montparnasse, where,\nhowever, he remained but one quarter for two reasons: in the first\nplace, the ground floor and the garden cost three hundred francs, and he\ndared not spend more than two hundred francs on his rent; in the second,\nbeing near Faton's shooting-gallery, he could hear the pistol-shots;\nwhich was intolerable to him.\n\nHe carried off his Flora, his copper-plates, his herbariums, his\nportfolios, and his books, and established himself near the Salpetriere,\nin a sort of thatched cottage of the village of Austerlitz, where,\nfor fifty crowns a year, he got three rooms and a garden enclosed by a\nhedge, and containing a well. He took advantage of this removal to sell\noff nearly all his furniture. On the day of his entrance into his new\nquarters, he was very gay, and drove the nails on which his engravings\nand herbariums were to hang, with his own hands, dug in his garden the\nrest of the day, and at night, perceiving that Mother Plutarque had a\nmelancholy air, and was very thoughtful, he tapped her on the shoulder\nand said to her with a smile: \"We have the indigo!\"\n\nOnly two visitors, the bookseller of the Porte-Saint-Jacques and Marius,\nwere admitted to view the thatched cottage at Austerlitz, a brawling\nname which was, to tell the truth, extremely disagreeable to him.\n\nHowever, as we have just pointed out, brains which are absorbed in some\nbit of wisdom, or folly, or, as it often happens, in both at once, are\nbut slowly accessible to the things of actual life. Their own destiny\nis a far-off thing to them. There results from such concentration a\npassivity, which, if it were the outcome of reasoning, would resemble\nphilosophy. One declines, descends, trickles away, even crumbles away,\nand yet is hardly conscious of it one's self. It always ends, it is\ntrue, in an awakening, but the awakening is tardy. In the meantime, it\nseems as though we held ourselves neutral in the game which is going on\nbetween our happiness and our unhappiness. We are the stake, and we look\non at the game with indifference.\n\nIt is thus that, athwart the cloud which formed about him, when all his\nhopes were extinguished one after the other, M. Mabeuf remained rather\npuerilely, but profoundly serene. His habits of mind had the regular\nswing of a pendulum. Once mounted on an illusion, he went for a very\nlong time, even after the illusion had disappeared. A clock does not\nstop short at the precise moment when the key is lost.\n\nM. Mabeuf had his innocent pleasures. These pleasures were inexpensive\nand unexpected; the merest chance furnished them. One day, Mother\nPlutarque was reading a romance in one corner of the room. She was\nreading aloud, finding that she understood better thus. To read aloud is\nto assure one's self of what one is reading. There are people who read\nvery loud, and who have the appearance of giving themselves their word\nof honor as to what they are perusing.\n\nIt was with this sort of energy that Mother Plutarque was reading the\nromance which she had in hand. M. Mabeuf heard her without listening to\nher.\n\nIn the course of her reading, Mother Plutarque came to this phrase. It\nwas a question of an officer of dragoons and a beauty:--\n\n\"--The beauty pouted, and the dragoon--\"\n\nHere she interrupted herself to wipe her glasses.\n\n\"Bouddha and the Dragon,\" struck in M. Mabeuf in a low voice. \"Yes, it\nis true that there was a dragon, which, from the depths of its cave,\nspouted flame through his maw and set the heavens on fire. Many stars\nhad already been consumed by this monster, which, besides, had the claws\nof a tiger. Bouddha went into its den and succeeded in converting the\ndragon. That is a good book that you are reading, Mother Plutarque.\nThere is no more beautiful legend in existence.\"\n\nAnd M. Mabeuf fell into a delicious revery.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V--POVERTY A GOOD NEIGHBOR FOR MISERY\n\nMarius liked this candid old man who saw himself gradually falling into\nthe clutches of indigence, and who came to feel astonishment, little\nby little, without, however, being made melancholy by it. Marius met\nCourfeyrac and sought out M. Mabeuf. Very rarely, however; twice a month\nat most.\n\nMarius' pleasure consisted in taking long walks alone on the outer\nboulevards, or in the Champs-de-Mars, or in the least frequented alleys\nof the Luxembourg. He often spent half a day in gazing at a market\ngarden, the beds of lettuce, the chickens on the dung-heap, the horse\nturning the water-wheel. The passers-by stared at him in surprise, and\nsome of them thought his attire suspicious and his mien sinister. He was\nonly a poor young man dreaming in an objectless way.\n\nIt was during one of his strolls that he had hit upon the Gorbeau house,\nand, tempted by its isolation and its cheapness, had taken up his abode\nthere. He was known there only under the name of M. Marius.\n\nSome of his father's old generals or old comrades had invited him to go\nand see them, when they learned about him. Marius had not refused their\ninvitations. They afforded opportunities of talking about his father.\nThus he went from time to time, to Comte Pajol, to General Bellavesne,\nto General Fririon, to the Invalides. There was music and dancing there.\nOn such evenings, Marius put on his new coat. But he never went to\nthese evening parties or balls except on days when it was freezing cold,\nbecause he could not afford a carriage, and he did not wish to arrive\nwith boots otherwise than like mirrors.\n\nHe said sometimes, but without bitterness: \"Men are so made that in a\ndrawing-room you may be soiled everywhere except on your shoes. In order\nto insure a good reception there, only one irreproachable thing is asked\nof you; your conscience? No, your boots.\"\n\nAll passions except those of the heart are dissipated by revery. Marius'\npolitical fevers vanished thus. The Revolution of 1830 assisted in the\nprocess, by satisfying and calming him. He remained the same, setting\naside his fits of wrath. He still held the same opinions. Only, they had\nbeen tempered. To speak accurately, he had no longer any opinions, he\nhad sympathies. To what party did he belong? To the party of humanity.\nOut of humanity he chose France; out of the Nation he chose the people;\nout of the people he chose the woman. It was to that point above all,\nthat his pity was directed. Now he preferred an idea to a deed, a\npoet to a hero, and he admired a book like Job more than an event like\nMarengo. And then, when, after a day spent in meditation, he returned\nin the evening through the boulevards, and caught a glimpse through\nthe branches of the trees of the fathomless space beyond, the nameless\ngleams, the abyss, the shadow, the mystery, all that which is only human\nseemed very petty indeed to him.\n\nHe thought that he had, and he really had, in fact, arrived at the truth\nof life and of human philosophy, and he had ended by gazing at nothing\nbut heaven, the only thing which Truth can perceive from the bottom of\nher well.\n\nThis did not prevent him from multiplying his plans, his combinations,\nhis scaffoldings, his projects for the future. In this state of revery,\nan eye which could have cast a glance into Marius' interior would have\nbeen dazzled with the purity of that soul. In fact, had it been given to\nour eyes of the flesh to gaze into the consciences of others, we should\nbe able to judge a man much more surely according to what he dreams,\nthan according to what he thinks. There is will in thought, there is\nnone in dreams. Revery, which is utterly spontaneous, takes and keeps,\neven in the gigantic and the ideal, the form of our spirit. Nothing\nproceeds more directly and more sincerely from the very depth of our\nsoul, than our unpremeditated and boundless aspirations towards\nthe splendors of destiny. In these aspirations, much more than in\ndeliberate, rational coordinated ideas, is the real character of a man\nto be found. Our chimeras are the things which the most resemble us.\nEach one of us dreams of the unknown and the impossible in accordance\nwith his nature.\n\nTowards the middle of this year 1831, the old woman who waited on Marius\ntold him that his neighbors, the wretched Jondrette family, had been\nturned out of doors. Marius, who passed nearly the whole of his days out\nof the house, hardly knew that he had any neighbors.\n\n\"Why are they turned out?\" he asked.\n\n\"Because they do not pay their rent; they owe for two quarters.\"\n\n\"How much is it?\"\n\n\"Twenty francs,\" said the old woman.\n\nMarius had thirty francs saved up in a drawer.\n\n\"Here,\" he said to the old woman, \"take these twenty-five francs. Pay\nfor the poor people and give them five francs, and do not tell them that\nit was I.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI--THE SUBSTITUTE\n\nIt chanced that the regiment to which Lieutenant Theodule belonged came\nto perform garrison duty in Paris. This inspired Aunt Gillenormand with\na second idea. She had, on the first occasion, hit upon the plan of\nhaving Marius spied upon by Theodule; now she plotted to have Theodule\ntake Marius' place.\n\nAt all events and in case the grandfather should feel the vague need of\na young face in the house,--these rays of dawn are sometimes sweet to\nruin,--it was expedient to find another Marius. \"Take it as a simple\nerratum,\" she thought, \"such as one sees in books. For Marius, read\nTheodule.\"\n\nA grandnephew is almost the same as a grandson; in default of a lawyer\none takes a lancer.\n\nOne morning, when M. Gillenormand was about to read something in the\nQuotidienne, his daughter entered and said to him in her sweetest voice;\nfor the question concerned her favorite:--\n\n\"Father, Theodule is coming to present his respects to you this\nmorning.\"\n\n\"Who's Theodule?\"\n\n\"Your grandnephew.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" said the grandfather.\n\nThen he went back to his reading, thought no more of his grandnephew,\nwho was merely some Theodule or other, and soon flew into a rage, which\nalmost always happened when he read. The \"sheet\" which he held, although\nRoyalist, of course, announced for the following day, without any\nsoftening phrases, one of these little events which were of daily\noccurrence at that date in Paris: \"That the students of the schools\nof law and medicine were to assemble on the Place du Pantheon, at\nmidday,--to deliberate.\" The discussion concerned one of the questions\nof the moment, the artillery of the National Guard, and a conflict\nbetween the Minister of War and \"the citizen's militia,\" on the subject\nof the cannon parked in the courtyard of the Louvre. The students were\nto \"deliberate\" over this. It did not take much more than this to swell\nM. Gillenormand's rage.\n\nHe thought of Marius, who was a student, and who would probably go with\nthe rest, to \"deliberate, at midday, on the Place du Pantheon.\"\n\nAs he was indulging in this painful dream, Lieutenant Theodule entered\nclad in plain clothes as a bourgeois, which was clever of him, and\nwas discreetly introduced by Mademoiselle Gillenormand. The lancer had\nreasoned as follows: \"The old druid has not sunk all his money in a life\npension. It is well to disguise one's self as a civilian from time to\ntime.\"\n\nMademoiselle Gillenormand said aloud to her father:--\n\n\"Theodule, your grandnephew.\"\n\nAnd in a low voice to the lieutenant:--\n\n\"Approve of everything.\"\n\nAnd she withdrew.\n\nThe lieutenant, who was but little accustomed to such venerable\nencounters, stammered with some timidity: \"Good day, uncle,\"--and made\na salute composed of the involuntary and mechanical outline of the\nmilitary salute finished off as a bourgeois salute.\n\n\"Ah! so it's you; that is well, sit down,\" said the old gentleman.\n\nThat said, he totally forgot the lancer.\n\nTheodule seated himself, and M. Gillenormand rose.\n\nM. Gillenormand began to pace back and forth, his hands in his pockets,\ntalking aloud, and twitching, with his irritated old fingers, at the two\nwatches which he wore in his two fobs.\n\n\"That pack of brats! they convene on the Place du Pantheon! by my life!\nurchins who were with their nurses but yesterday! If one were to squeeze\ntheir noses, milk would burst out. And they deliberate to-morrow, at\nmidday. What are we coming to? What are we coming to? It is clear that\nwe are making for the abyss. That is what the descamisados have brought\nus to! To deliberate on the citizen artillery! To go and jabber in the\nopen air over the jibes of the National Guard! And with whom are they to\nmeet there? Just see whither Jacobinism leads. I will bet anything you\nlike, a million against a counter, that there will be no one there but\nreturned convicts and released galley-slaves. The Republicans and the\ngalley-slaves,--they form but one nose and one handkerchief. Carnot used\nto say: 'Where would you have me go, traitor?' Fouche replied: 'Wherever\nyou please, imbecile!' That's what the Republicans are like.\"\n\n\"That is true,\" said Theodule.\n\nM. Gillenormand half turned his head, saw Theodule, and went on:--\n\n\"When one reflects that that scoundrel was so vile as to turn carbonaro!\nWhy did you leave my house? To go and become a Republican! Pssst! In\nthe first place, the people want none of your republic, they have common\nsense, they know well that there always have been kings, and that there\nalways will be; they know well that the people are only the people,\nafter all, they make sport of it, of your republic--do you understand,\nidiot? Is it not a horrible caprice? To fall in love with Pere Duchesne,\nto make sheep's-eyes at the guillotine, to sing romances, and play on\nthe guitar under the balcony of '93--it's enough to make one spit on all\nthese young fellows, such fools are they! They are all alike. Not one\nescapes. It suffices for them to breathe the air which blows through the\nstreet to lose their senses. The nineteenth century is poison. The\nfirst scamp that happens along lets his beard grow like a goat's,\nthinks himself a real scoundrel, and abandons his old relatives. He's\na Republican, he's a romantic. What does that mean, romantic? Do me the\nfavor to tell me what it is. All possible follies. A year ago, they ran\nto Hernani. Now, I just ask you, Hernani! antitheses! abominations\nwhich are not even written in French! And then, they have cannons in the\ncourtyard of the Louvre. Such are the rascalities of this age!\"\n\n\"You are right, uncle,\" said Theodule.\n\nM. Gillenormand resumed:--\n\n\"Cannons in the courtyard of the Museum! For what purpose? Do you want\nto fire grape-shot at the Apollo Belvedere? What have those cartridges\nto do with the Venus de Medici? Oh! the young men of the present day are\nall blackguards! What a pretty creature is their Benjamin Constant! And\nthose who are not rascals are simpletons! They do all they can to make\nthemselves ugly, they are badly dressed, they are afraid of women, in\nthe presence of petticoats they have a mendicant air which sets the\ngirls into fits of laughter; on my word of honor, one would say the poor\ncreatures were ashamed of love. They are deformed, and they complete\nthemselves by being stupid; they repeat the puns of Tiercelin and\nPotier, they have sack coats, stablemen's waistcoats, shirts of coarse\nlinen, trousers of coarse cloth, boots of coarse leather, and their\nrigmarole resembles their plumage. One might make use of their jargon\nto put new soles on their old shoes. And all this awkward batch of brats\nhas political opinions, if you please. Political opinions should be\nstrictly forbidden. They fabricate systems, they recast society, they\ndemolish the monarchy, they fling all laws to the earth, they put the\nattic in the cellar's place and my porter in the place of the King, they\nturn Europe topsy-turvy, they reconstruct the world, and all their love\naffairs consist in staring slily at the ankles of the laundresses as\nthese women climb into their carts. Ah! Marius! Ah! you blackguard! to\ngo and vociferate on the public place! to discuss, to debate, to take\nmeasures! They call that measures, just God! Disorder humbles itself\nand becomes silly. I have seen chaos, I now see a mess. Students\ndeliberating on the National Guard,--such a thing could not be seen\namong the Ogibewas nor the Cadodaches! Savages who go naked, with their\nnoddles dressed like a shuttlecock, with a club in their paws, are less\nof brutes than those bachelors of arts! The four-penny monkeys! And they\nset up for judges! Those creatures deliberate and ratiocinate! The\nend of the world is come! This is plainly the end of this miserable\nterraqueous globe! A final hiccough was required, and France has emitted\nit. Deliberate, my rascals! Such things will happen so long as they go\nand read the newspapers under the arcades of the Odeon. That costs them\na sou, and their good sense, and their intelligence, and their heart and\ntheir soul, and their wits. They emerge thence, and decamp from their\nfamilies. All newspapers are pests; all, even the Drapeau Blanc! At\nbottom, Martainville was a Jacobin. Ah! just Heaven! you may boast of\nhaving driven your grandfather to despair, that you may!\"\n\n\"That is evident,\" said Theodule.\n\nAnd profiting by the fact that M. Gillenormand was taking breath, the\nlancer added in a magisterial manner:--\n\n\"There should be no other newspaper than the Moniteur, and no other book\nthan the Annuaire Militaire.\"\n\nM. Gillenormand continued:--\n\n\"It is like their Sieyes! A regicide ending in a senator; for that is\nthe way they always end. They give themselves a scar with the address\nof thou as citizens, in order to get themselves called, eventually,\nMonsieur le Comte. Monsieur le Comte as big as my arm, assassins of\nSeptember. The philosopher Sieyes! I will do myself the justice to say,\nthat I have never had any better opinion of the philosophies of all\nthose philosophers, than of the spectacles of the grimacer of Tivoli!\nOne day I saw the Senators cross the Quai Malplaquet in mantles of\nviolet velvet sown with bees, with hats a la Henri IV. They were\nhideous. One would have pronounced them monkeys from the tiger's court.\nCitizens, I declare to you, that your progress is madness, that your\nhumanity is a dream, that your revolution is a crime, that your republic\nis a monster, that your young and virgin France comes from the brothel,\nand I maintain it against all, whoever you may be, whether journalists,\neconomists, legists, or even were you better judges of liberty, of\nequality, and fraternity than the knife of the guillotine! And that I\nannounce to you, my fine fellows!\"\n\n\"Parbleu!\" cried the lieutenant, \"that is wonderfully true.\"\n\nM. Gillenormand paused in a gesture which he had begun, wheeled round,\nstared Lancer Theodule intently in the eyes, and said to him:--\n\n\"You are a fool.\"\n\n\n\n\nBOOK SIXTH.--THE CONJUNCTION OF TWO STARS\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I--THE SOBRIQUET: MODE OF FORMATION OF FAMILY NAMES\n\nMarius was, at this epoch, a handsome young man, of medium stature,\nwith thick and intensely black hair, a lofty and intelligent brow,\nwell-opened and passionate nostrils, an air of calmness and sincerity,\nand with something indescribably proud, thoughtful, and innocent over\nhis whole countenance. His profile, all of whose lines were rounded,\nwithout thereby losing their firmness, had a certain Germanic sweetness,\nwhich has made its way into the French physiognomy by way of Alsace\nand Lorraine, and that complete absence of angles which rendered\nthe Sicambres so easily recognizable among the Romans, and which\ndistinguishes the leonine from the aquiline race. He was at that period\nof life when the mind of men who think is composed, in nearly equal\nparts, of depth and ingenuousness. A grave situation being given, he\nhad all that is required to be stupid: one more turn of the key, and he\nmight be sublime. His manners were reserved, cold, polished, not very\ngenial. As his mouth was charming, his lips the reddest, and his teeth\nthe whitest in the world, his smile corrected the severity of his face,\nas a whole. At certain moments, that pure brow and that voluptuous smile\npresented a singular contrast. His eyes were small, but his glance was\nlarge.\n\nAt the period of his most abject misery, he had observed that young\ngirls turned round when he passed by, and he fled or hid, with death in\nhis soul. He thought that they were staring at him because of his old\nclothes, and that they were laughing at them; the fact is, that they\nstared at him because of his grace, and that they dreamed of him.\n\nThis mute misunderstanding between him and the pretty passers-by had\nmade him shy. He chose none of them for the excellent reason that\nhe fled from all of them. He lived thus indefinitely,--stupidly, as\nCourfeyrac said.\n\nCourfeyrac also said to him: \"Do not aspire to be venerable\" [they\ncalled each other thou; it is the tendency of youthful friendships to\nslip into this mode of address]. \"Let me give you a piece of advice,\nmy dear fellow. Don't read so many books, and look a little more at the\nlasses. The jades have some good points about them, O Marius! By dint of\nfleeing and blushing, you will become brutalized.\"\n\nOn other occasions, Courfeyrac encountered him and said:--\"Good morning,\nMonsieur l'Abbe!\"\n\nWhen Courfeyrac had addressed to him some remark of this nature, Marius\navoided women, both young and old, more than ever for a week to come,\nand he avoided Courfeyrac to boot.\n\nNevertheless, there existed in all the immensity of creation, two women\nwhom Marius did not flee, and to whom he paid no attention whatever. In\ntruth, he would have been very much amazed if he had been informed\nthat they were women. One was the bearded old woman who swept out his\nchamber, and caused Courfeyrac to say: \"Seeing that his servant woman\nwears his beard, Marius does not wear his own beard.\" The other was a\nsort of little girl whom he saw very often, and whom he never looked at.\n\nFor more than a year, Marius had noticed in one of the walks of the\nLuxembourg, the one which skirts the parapet of the Pepiniere, a man\nand a very young girl, who were almost always seated side by side on the\nsame bench, at the most solitary end of the alley, on the Rue de l'Ouest\nside. Every time that that chance which meddles with the strolls of\npersons whose gaze is turned inwards, led Marius to that walk,--and it\nwas nearly every day,--he found this couple there. The man appeared to\nbe about sixty years of age; he seemed sad and serious; his whole person\npresented the robust and weary aspect peculiar to military men who have\nretired from the service. If he had worn a decoration, Marius would have\nsaid: \"He is an ex-officer.\" He had a kindly but unapproachable air,\nand he never let his glance linger on the eyes of any one. He wore\nblue trousers, a blue frock coat and a broad-brimmed hat, which always\nappeared to be new, a black cravat, a quaker shirt, that is to say, it\nwas dazzlingly white, but of coarse linen. A grisette who passed near\nhim one day, said: \"Here's a very tidy widower.\" His hair was very\nwhite.\n\nThe first time that the young girl who accompanied him came and seated\nherself on the bench which they seemed to have adopted, she was a sort\nof child thirteen or fourteen years of age, so thin as to be almost\nhomely, awkward, insignificant, and with a possible promise of\nhandsome eyes. Only, they were always raised with a sort of displeasing\nassurance. Her dress was both aged and childish, like the dress of the\nscholars in a convent; it consisted of a badly cut gown of black merino.\nThey had the air of being father and daughter.\n\nMarius scanned this old man, who was not yet aged, and this little\ngirl, who was not yet a person, for a few days, and thereafter paid no\nattention to them. They, on their side, did not appear even to see him.\nThey conversed together with a peaceful and indifferent air. The girl\nchattered incessantly and merrily. The old man talked but little, and,\nat times, he fixed on her eyes overflowing with an ineffable paternity.\n\nMarius had acquired the mechanical habit of strolling in that walk. He\ninvariably found them there.\n\nThis is the way things went:--\n\nMarius liked to arrive by the end of the alley which was furthest from\ntheir bench; he walked the whole length of the alley, passed in front\nof them, then returned to the extremity whence he had come, and began\nagain. This he did five or six times in the course of his promenade,\nand the promenade was taken five or six times a week, without its\nhaving occurred to him or to these people to exchange a greeting. That\npersonage, and that young girl, although they appeared,--and perhaps\nbecause they appeared,--to shun all glances, had, naturally, caused some\nattention on the part of the five or six students who strolled along\nthe Pepiniere from time to time; the studious after their lectures,\nthe others after their game of billiards. Courfeyrac, who was among the\nlast, had observed them several times, but, finding the girl homely, he\nhad speedily and carefully kept out of the way. He had fled, discharging\nat them a sobriquet, like a Parthian dart. Impressed solely with\nthe child's gown and the old man's hair, he had dubbed the daughter\nMademoiselle Lanoire, and the father, Monsieur Leblanc, so that as no\none knew them under any other title, this nickname became a law in the\ndefault of any other name. The students said: \"Ah! Monsieur Leblanc is\non his bench.\" And Marius, like the rest, had found it convenient to\ncall this unknown gentleman Monsieur Leblanc.\n\nWe shall follow their example, and we shall say M. Leblanc, in order to\nfacilitate this tale.\n\nSo Marius saw them nearly every day, at the same hour, during the first\nyear. He found the man to his taste, but the girl insipid.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II--LUX FACTA EST\n\nDuring the second year, precisely at the point in this history which the\nreader has now reached, it chanced that this habit of the Luxembourg was\ninterrupted, without Marius himself being quite aware why, and nearly\nsix months elapsed, during which he did not set foot in the alley. One\nday, at last, he returned thither once more; it was a serene summer\nmorning, and Marius was in joyous mood, as one is when the weather is\nfine. It seemed to him that he had in his heart all the songs of the\nbirds that he was listening to, and all the bits of blue sky of which he\ncaught glimpses through the leaves of the trees.\n\nHe went straight to \"his alley,\" and when he reached the end of it he\nperceived, still on the same bench, that well-known couple. Only, when\nhe approached, it certainly was the same man; but it seemed to him that\nit was no longer the same girl. The person whom he now beheld was a tall\nand beautiful creature, possessed of all the most charming lines of a\nwoman at the precise moment when they are still combined with all the\nmost ingenuous graces of the child; a pure and fugitive moment, which\ncan be expressed only by these two words,--\"fifteen years.\" She had\nwonderful brown hair, shaded with threads of gold, a brow that seemed\nmade of marble, cheeks that seemed made of rose-leaf, a pale flush,\nan agitated whiteness, an exquisite mouth, whence smiles darted like\nsunbeams, and words like music, a head such as Raphael would have given\nto Mary, set upon a neck that Jean Goujon would have attributed to a\nVenus. And, in order that nothing might be lacking to this bewitching\nface, her nose was not handsome--it was pretty; neither straight nor\ncurved, neither Italian nor Greek; it was the Parisian nose, that is\nto say, spiritual, delicate, irregular, pure,--which drives painters to\ndespair, and charms poets.\n\nWhen Marius passed near her, he could not see her eyes, which were\nconstantly lowered. He saw only her long chestnut lashes, permeated with\nshadow and modesty.\n\nThis did not prevent the beautiful child from smiling as she listened\nto what the white-haired old man was saying to her, and nothing could\nbe more fascinating than that fresh smile, combined with those drooping\neyes.\n\nFor a moment, Marius thought that she was another daughter of the same\nman, a sister of the former, no doubt. But when the invariable habit of\nhis stroll brought him, for the second time, near the bench, and he had\nexamined her attentively, he recognized her as the same. In six months\nthe little girl had become a young maiden; that was all. Nothing is more\nfrequent than this phenomenon. There is a moment when girls blossom out\nin the twinkling of an eye, and become roses all at once. One left\nthem children but yesterday; today, one finds them disquieting to the\nfeelings.\n\nThis child had not only grown, she had become idealized. As three days\nin April suffice to cover certain trees with flowers, six months had\nsufficed to clothe her with beauty. Her April had arrived.\n\nOne sometimes sees people, who, poor and mean, seem to wake up, pass\nsuddenly from indigence to luxury, indulge in expenditures of all sorts,\nand become dazzling, prodigal, magnificent, all of a sudden. That is\nthe result of having pocketed an income; a note fell due yesterday. The\nyoung girl had received her quarterly income.\n\nAnd then, she was no longer the school-girl with her felt hat, her\nmerino gown, her scholar's shoes, and red hands; taste had come to her\nwith beauty; she was a well-dressed person, clad with a sort of rich\nand simple elegance, and without affectation. She wore a dress of black\ndamask, a cape of the same material, and a bonnet of white crape. Her\nwhite gloves displayed the delicacy of the hand which toyed with the\ncarved, Chinese ivory handle of a parasol, and her silken shoe outlined\nthe smallness of her foot. When one passed near her, her whole toilette\nexhaled a youthful and penetrating perfume.\n\nAs for the man, he was the same as usual.\n\nThe second time that Marius approached her, the young girl raised her\neyelids; her eyes were of a deep, celestial blue, but in that veiled\nazure, there was, as yet, nothing but the glance of a child. She looked\nat Marius indifferently, as she would have stared at the brat running\nbeneath the sycamores, or the marble vase which cast a shadow on the\nbench, and Marius, on his side, continued his promenade, and thought\nabout something else.\n\nHe passed near the bench where the young girl sat, five or six times,\nbut without even turning his eyes in her direction.\n\nOn the following days, he returned, as was his wont, to the Luxembourg;\nas usual, he found there \"the father and daughter;\" but he paid no\nfurther attention to them. He thought no more about the girl now that\nshe was beautiful than he had when she was homely. He passed very near\nthe bench where she sat, because such was his habit.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III--EFFECT OF THE SPRING\n\nOne day, the air was warm, the Luxembourg was inundated with light\nand shade, the sky was as pure as though the angels had washed it that\nmorning, the sparrows were giving vent to little twitters in the depths\nof the chestnut-trees. Marius had thrown open his whole soul to nature,\nhe was not thinking of anything, he simply lived and breathed, he passed\nnear the bench, the young girl raised her eyes to him, the two glances\nmet.\n\nWhat was there in the young girl's glance on this occasion? Marius could\nnot have told. There was nothing and there was everything. It was a\nstrange flash.\n\nShe dropped her eyes, and he pursued his way.\n\nWhat he had just seen was no longer the ingenuous and simple eye of a\nchild; it was a mysterious gulf which had half opened, then abruptly\nclosed again.\n\nThere comes a day when the young girl glances in this manner. Woe to him\nwho chances to be there!\n\nThat first gaze of a soul which does not, as yet, know itself, is\nlike the dawn in the sky. It is the awakening of something radiant\nand strange. Nothing can give any idea of the dangerous charm of that\nunexpected gleam, which flashes suddenly and vaguely forth from adorable\nshadows, and which is composed of all the innocence of the present, and\nof all the passion of the future. It is a sort of undecided tenderness\nwhich reveals itself by chance, and which waits. It is a snare which\nthe innocent maiden sets unknown to herself, and in which she captures\nhearts without either wishing or knowing it. It is a virgin looking like\na woman.\n\nIt is rare that a profound revery does not spring from that glance,\nwhere it falls. All purities and all candors meet in that celestial\nand fatal gleam which, more than all the best-planned tender glances of\ncoquettes, possesses the magic power of causing the sudden blossoming,\nin the depths of the soul, of that sombre flower, impregnated with\nperfume and with poison, which is called love.\n\nThat evening, on his return to his garret, Marius cast his eyes over\nhis garments, and perceived, for the first time, that he had been so\nslovenly, indecorous, and inconceivably stupid as to go for his walk in\nthe Luxembourg with his \"every-day clothes,\" that is to say, with a\nhat battered near the band, coarse carter's boots, black trousers\nwhich showed white at the knees, and a black coat which was pale at the\nelbows.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV--BEGINNING OF A GREAT MALADY\n\nOn the following day, at the accustomed hour, Marius drew from his\nwardrobe his new coat, his new trousers, his new hat, and his new\nboots; he clothed himself in this complete panoply, put on his gloves, a\ntremendous luxury, and set off for the Luxembourg.\n\nOn the way thither, he encountered Courfeyrac, and pretended not to see\nhim. Courfeyrac, on his return home, said to his friends:--\n\n\"I have just met Marius' new hat and new coat, with Marius inside\nthem. He was going to pass an examination, no doubt. He looked utterly\nstupid.\"\n\nOn arriving at the Luxembourg, Marius made the tour of the fountain\nbasin, and stared at the swans; then he remained for a long time in\ncontemplation before a statue whose head was perfectly black with mould,\nand one of whose hips was missing. Near the basin there was a bourgeois\nforty years of age, with a prominent stomach, who was holding by the\nhand a little urchin of five, and saying to him: \"Shun excess, my son,\nkeep at an equal distance from despotism and from anarchy.\" Marius\nlistened to this bourgeois. Then he made the circuit of the basin once\nmore. At last he directed his course towards \"his alley,\" slowly, and as\nif with regret. One would have said that he was both forced to go there\nand withheld from doing so. He did not perceive it himself, and thought\nthat he was doing as he always did.\n\nOn turning into the walk, he saw M. Leblanc and the young girl at the\nother end, \"on their bench.\" He buttoned his coat up to the very top,\npulled it down on his body so that there might be no wrinkles, examined,\nwith a certain complaisance, the lustrous gleams of his trousers, and\nmarched on the bench. This march savored of an attack, and certainly\nof a desire for conquest. So I say that he marched on the bench, as I\nshould say: \"Hannibal marched on Rome.\"\n\nHowever, all his movements were purely mechanical, and he had\ninterrupted none of the habitual preoccupations of his mind and labors.\nAt that moment, he was thinking that the Manuel du Baccalaureat was\na stupid book, and that it must have been drawn up by rare idiots, to\nallow of three tragedies of Racine and only one comedy of Moliere being\nanalyzed therein as masterpieces of the human mind. There was a piercing\nwhistling going on in his ears. As he approached the bench, he held\nfast to the folds in his coat, and fixed his eyes on the young girl. It\nseemed to him that she filled the entire extremity of the alley with a\nvague blue light.\n\nIn proportion as he drew near, his pace slackened more and more. On\narriving at some little distance from the bench, and long before he had\nreached the end of the walk, he halted, and could not explain to himself\nwhy he retraced his steps. He did not even say to himself that he would\nnot go as far as the end. It was only with difficulty that the young\ngirl could have perceived him in the distance and noted his fine\nappearance in his new clothes. Nevertheless, he held himself very erect,\nin case any one should be looking at him from behind.\n\nHe attained the opposite end, then came back, and this time he\napproached a little nearer to the bench. He even got to within three\nintervals of trees, but there he felt an indescribable impossibility of\nproceeding further, and he hesitated. He thought he saw the young girl's\nface bending towards him. But he exerted a manly and violent effort,\nsubdued his hesitation, and walked straight ahead. A few seconds later,\nhe rushed in front of the bench, erect and firm, reddening to the very\nears, without daring to cast a glance either to the right or to the\nleft, with his hand thrust into his coat like a statesman. At the moment\nwhen he passed,--under the cannon of the place,--he felt his heart beat\nwildly. As on the preceding day, she wore her damask gown and her crape\nbonnet. He heard an ineffable voice, which must have been \"her voice.\"\nShe was talking tranquilly. She was very pretty. He felt it, although he\nmade no attempt to see her. \"She could not, however,\" he thought, \"help\nfeeling esteem and consideration for me, if she only knew that I am\nthe veritable author of the dissertation on Marcos Obregon de la Ronde,\nwhich M. Francois de Neufchateau put, as though it were his own, at the\nhead of his edition of Gil Blas.\" He went beyond the bench as far as the\nextremity of the walk, which was very near, then turned on his heel and\npassed once more in front of the lovely girl. This time, he was very\npale. Moreover, all his emotions were disagreeable. As he went further\nfrom the bench and the young girl, and while his back was turned to her,\nhe fancied that she was gazing after him, and that made him stumble.\n\nHe did not attempt to approach the bench again; he halted near the\nmiddle of the walk, and there, a thing which he never did, he sat down,\nand reflecting in the most profoundly indistinct depths of his spirit,\nthat after all, it was hard that persons whose white bonnet and black\ngown he admired should be absolutely insensible to his splendid trousers\nand his new coat.\n\nAt the expiration of a quarter of an hour, he rose, as though he were\non the point of again beginning his march towards that bench which was\nsurrounded by an aureole. But he remained standing there, motionless.\nFor the first time in fifteen months, he said to himself that that\ngentleman who sat there every day with his daughter, had, on his side,\nnoticed him, and probably considered his assiduity singular.\n\nFor the first time, also, he was conscious of some irreverence in\ndesignating that stranger, even in his secret thoughts, by the sobriquet\nof M. le Blanc.\n\nHe stood thus for several minutes, with drooping head, tracing figures\nin the sand, with the cane which he held in his hand.\n\nThen he turned abruptly in the direction opposite to the bench, to M.\nLeblanc and his daughter, and went home.\n\nThat day he forgot to dine. At eight o'clock in the evening he perceived\nthis fact, and as it was too late to go down to the Rue Saint-Jacques,\nhe said: \"Never mind!\" and ate a bit of bread.\n\nHe did not go to bed until he had brushed his coat and folded it up with\ngreat care.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V--DIVRS CLAPS OF THUNDER FALL ON MA'AM BOUGON\n\nOn the following day, Ma'am Bougon, as Courfeyrac styled the old\nportress-principal-tenant, housekeeper of the Gorbeau hovel, Ma'am\nBougon, whose name was, in reality, Madame Burgon, as we have found\nout, but this iconoclast, Courfeyrac, respected nothing,--Ma'am Bougon\nobserved, with stupefaction, that M. Marius was going out again in his\nnew coat.\n\nHe went to the Luxembourg again, but he did not proceed further than his\nbench midway of the alley. He seated himself there, as on the preceding\nday, surveying from a distance, and clearly making out, the white\nbonnet, the black dress, and above all, that blue light. He did not stir\nfrom it, and only went home when the gates of the Luxembourg closed. He\ndid not see M. Leblanc and his daughter retire. He concluded that they\nhad quitted the garden by the gate on the Rue de l'Ouest. Later on,\nseveral weeks afterwards, when he came to think it over, he could never\nrecall where he had dined that evening.\n\nOn the following day, which was the third, Ma'am Bougon was\nthunderstruck. Marius went out in his new coat. \"Three days in\nsuccession!\" she exclaimed.\n\nShe tried to follow him, but Marius walked briskly, and with immense\nstrides; it was a hippopotamus undertaking the pursuit of a chamois.\nShe lost sight of him in two minutes, and returned breathless,\nthree-quarters choked with asthma, and furious. \"If there is any sense,\"\nshe growled, \"in putting on one's best clothes every day, and making\npeople run like this!\"\n\nMarius betook himself to the Luxembourg.\n\nThe young girl was there with M. Leblanc. Marius approached as near as\nhe could, pretending to be busy reading a book, but he halted afar off,\nthen returned and seated himself on his bench, where he spent four hours\nin watching the house-sparrows who were skipping about the walk, and who\nproduced on him the impression that they were making sport of him.\n\nA fortnight passed thus. Marius went to the Luxembourg no longer for the\nsake of strolling there, but to seat himself always in the same spot,\nand that without knowing why. Once arrived there, he did not stir.\nHe put on his new coat every morning, for the purpose of not showing\nhimself, and he began all over again on the morrow.\n\nShe was decidedly a marvellous beauty. The only remark approaching a\ncriticism, that could be made, was, that the contradiction between\nher gaze, which was melancholy, and her smile, which was merry, gave\na rather wild effect to her face, which sometimes caused this sweet\ncountenance to become strange without ceasing to be charming.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI--TAKEN PRISONER\n\nOn one of the last days of the second week, Marius was seated on his\nbench, as usual, holding in his hand an open book, of which he had not\nturned a page for the last two hours. All at once he started. An event\nwas taking place at the other extremity of the walk. Leblanc and his\ndaughter had just left their seat, and the daughter had taken her\nfather's arm, and both were advancing slowly, towards the middle of the\nalley where Marius was. Marius closed his book, then opened it again,\nthen forced himself to read; he trembled; the aureole was coming\nstraight towards him. \"Ah! good Heavens!\" thought he, \"I shall not have\ntime to strike an attitude.\" Still the white-haired man and the girl\nadvanced. It seemed to him that this lasted for a century, and that it\nwas but a second. \"What are they coming in this direction for?\" he asked\nhimself. \"What! She will pass here? Her feet will tread this sand, this\nwalk, two paces from me?\" He was utterly upset, he would have liked to\nbe very handsome, he would have liked to own the cross. He heard the\nsoft and measured sound of their approaching footsteps. He imagined that\nM. Leblanc was darting angry glances at him. \"Is that gentleman going to\naddress me?\" he thought to himself. He dropped his head; when he raised\nit again, they were very near him. The young girl passed, and as she\npassed, she glanced at him. She gazed steadily at him, with a pensive\nsweetness which thrilled Marius from head to foot. It seemed to him\nthat she was reproaching him for having allowed so long a time to elapse\nwithout coming as far as her, and that she was saying to him: \"I am\ncoming myself.\" Marius was dazzled by those eyes fraught with rays and\nabysses.\n\nHe felt his brain on fire. She had come to him, what joy! And then, how\nshe had looked at him! She appeared to him more beautiful than he had\never seen her yet. Beautiful with a beauty which was wholly feminine and\nangelic, with a complete beauty which would have made Petrarch sing and\nDante kneel. It seemed to him that he was floating free in the azure\nheavens. At the same time, he was horribly vexed because there was dust\non his boots.\n\nHe thought he felt sure that she had looked at his boots too.\n\nHe followed her with his eyes until she disappeared. Then he started\nup and walked about the Luxembourg garden like a madman. It is possible\nthat, at times, he laughed to himself and talked aloud. He was so dreamy\nwhen he came near the children's nurses, that each one of them thought\nhim in love with her.\n\nHe quitted the Luxembourg, hoping to find her again in the street.\n\nHe encountered Courfeyrac under the arcades of the Odeon, and said to\nhim: \"Come and dine with me.\" They went off to Rousseau's and spent\nsix francs. Marius ate like an ogre. He gave the waiter six sous. At\ndessert, he said to Courfeyrac. \"Have you read the paper? What a fine\ndiscourse Audry de Puyraveau delivered!\"\n\nHe was desperately in love.\n\nAfter dinner, he said to Courfeyrac: \"I will treat you to the play.\"\nThey went to the Porte-Sainte-Martin to see Frederick in l'Auberge des\nAdrets. Marius was enormously amused.\n\nAt the same time, he had a redoubled attack of shyness. On emerging\nfrom the theatre, he refused to look at the garter of a modiste who was\nstepping across a gutter, and Courfeyrac, who said: \"I should like to\nput that woman in my collection,\" almost horrified him.\n\nCourfeyrac invited him to breakfast at the Cafe Voltaire on the\nfollowing morning. Marius went thither, and ate even more than on the\npreceding evening. He was very thoughtful and very merry. One would\nhave said that he was taking advantage of every occasion to laugh\nuproariously. He tenderly embraced some man or other from the provinces,\nwho was presented to him. A circle of students formed round the table,\nand they spoke of the nonsense paid for by the State which was uttered\nfrom the rostrum in the Sorbonne, then the conversation fell upon the\nfaults and omissions in Guicherat's dictionaries and grammars. Marius\ninterrupted the discussion to exclaim: \"But it is very agreeable, all\nthe same to have the cross!\"\n\n\"That's queer!\" whispered Courfeyrac to Jean Prouvaire.\n\n\"No,\" responded Prouvaire, \"that's serious.\"\n\nIt was serious; in fact, Marius had reached that first violent and\ncharming hour with which grand passions begin.\n\nA glance had wrought all this.\n\nWhen the mine is charged, when the conflagration is ready, nothing is\nmore simple. A glance is a spark.\n\nIt was all over with him. Marius loved a woman. His fate was entering\nthe unknown.\n\nThe glance of women resembles certain combinations of wheels, which are\ntranquil in appearance yet formidable. You pass close to them every\nday, peaceably and with impunity, and without a suspicion of anything. A\nmoment arrives when you forget that the thing is there. You go and come,\ndream, speak, laugh. All at once you feel yourself clutched; all is\nover. The wheels hold you fast, the glance has ensnared you. It has\ncaught you, no matter where or how, by some portion of your thought\nwhich was fluttering loose, by some distraction which had attacked you.\nYou are lost. The whole of you passes into it. A chain of mysterious\nforces takes possession of you. You struggle in vain; no more human\nsuccor is possible. You go on falling from gearing to gearing, from\nagony to agony, from torture to torture, you, your mind, your fortune,\nyour future, your soul; and, according to whether you are in the power\nof a wicked creature, or of a noble heart, you will not escape from this\nterrifying machine otherwise than disfigured with shame, or transfigured\nby passion.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII--ADVENTURES OF THE LETTER U DELIVERED OVER TO CONJECTURES\n\nIsolation, detachment from everything, pride, independence, the taste\nof nature, the absence of daily and material activity, the life within\nhimself, the secret conflicts of chastity, a benevolent ecstasy towards\nall creation, had prepared Marius for this possession which is called\npassion. His worship of his father had gradually become a religion,\nand, like all religions, it had retreated to the depths of his soul.\nSomething was required in the foreground. Love came.\n\nA full month elapsed, during which Marius went every day to the\nLuxembourg. When the hour arrived, nothing could hold him back.--\"He\nis on duty,\" said Courfeyrac. Marius lived in a state of delight. It is\ncertain that the young girl did look at him.\n\nHe had finally grown bold, and approached the bench. Still, he did not\npass in front of it any more, in obedience to the instinct of timidity\nand to the instinct of prudence common to lovers. He considered it\nbetter not to attract \"the attention of the father.\" He combined his\nstations behind the trees and the pedestals of the statues with a\nprofound diplomacy, so that he might be seen as much as possible by the\nyoung girl and as little as possible by the old gentleman. Sometimes, he\nremained motionless by the half-hour together in the shade of a Leonidas\nor a Spartacus, holding in his hand a book, above which his eyes, gently\nraised, sought the beautiful girl, and she, on her side, turned her\ncharming profile towards him with a vague smile. While conversing in the\nmost natural and tranquil manner in the world with the white-haired man,\nshe bent upon Marius all the reveries of a virginal and passionate eye.\nAncient and time-honored manoeuvre which Eve understood from the very\nfirst day of the world, and which every woman understands from the very\nfirst day of her life! her mouth replied to one, and her glance replied\nto another.\n\nIt must be supposed, that M. Leblanc finally noticed something, for\noften, when Marius arrived, he rose and began to walk about. He had\nabandoned their accustomed place and had adopted the bench by the\nGladiator, near the other end of the walk, as though with the object\nof seeing whether Marius would pursue them thither. Marius did not\nunderstand, and committed this error. \"The father\" began to grow\ninexact, and no longer brought \"his daughter\" every day. Sometimes, he\ncame alone. Then Marius did not stay. Another blunder.\n\nMarius paid no heed to these symptoms. From the phase of timidity, he\nhad passed, by a natural and fatal progress, to the phase of blindness.\nHis love increased. He dreamed of it every night. And then, an\nunexpected bliss had happened to him, oil on the fire, a redoubling of\nthe shadows over his eyes. One evening, at dusk, he had found, on\nthe bench which \"M. Leblanc and his daughter\" had just quitted, a\nhandkerchief, a very simple handkerchief, without embroidery, but white,\nand fine, and which seemed to him to exhale ineffable perfume. He seized\nit with rapture. This handkerchief was marked with the letters U. F.\nMarius knew nothing about this beautiful child,--neither her family\nname, her Christian name nor her abode; these two letters were the first\nthing of her that he had gained possession of, adorable initials, upon\nwhich he immediately began to construct his scaffolding. U was evidently\nthe Christian name. \"Ursule!\" he thought, \"what a delicious name!\" He\nkissed the handkerchief, drank it in, placed it on his heart, on his\nflesh, during the day, and at night, laid it beneath his lips that he\nmight fall asleep on it.\n\n\"I feel that her whole soul lies within it!\" he exclaimed.\n\nThis handkerchief belonged to the old gentleman, who had simply let it\nfall from his pocket.\n\nIn the days which followed the finding of this treasure, he only\ndisplayed himself at the Luxembourg in the act of kissing the\nhandkerchief and laying it on his heart. The beautiful child understood\nnothing of all this, and signified it to him by imperceptible signs.\n\n\"O modesty!\" said Marius.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII--THE VETERANS THEMSELVES CAN BE HAPPY\n\nSince we have pronounced the word modesty, and since we conceal nothing,\nwe ought to say that once, nevertheless, in spite of his ecstasies, \"his\nUrsule\" caused him very serious grief. It was on one of the days when\nshe persuaded M. Leblanc to leave the bench and stroll along the walk.\nA brisk May breeze was blowing, which swayed the crests of the\nplaintain-trees. The father and daughter, arm in arm, had just passed\nMarius' bench. Marius had risen to his feet behind them, and was\nfollowing them with his eyes, as was fitting in the desperate situation\nof his soul.\n\nAll at once, a gust of wind, more merry than the rest, and probably\ncharged with performing the affairs of Springtime, swept down from\nthe nursery, flung itself on the alley, enveloped the young girl in\na delicious shiver, worthy of Virgil's nymphs, and the fawns of\nTheocritus, and lifted her dress, the robe more sacred than that of\nIsis, almost to the height of her garter. A leg of exquisite shape\nappeared. Marius saw it. He was exasperated and furious.\n\nThe young girl had hastily thrust down her dress, with a divinely\ntroubled motion, but he was none the less angry for all that. He was\nalone in the alley, it is true. But there might have been some one\nthere. And what if there had been some one there! Can any one comprehend\nsuch a thing? What she had just done is horrible!--Alas, the poor child\nhad done nothing; there had been but one culprit, the wind; but Marius,\nin whom quivered the Bartholo who exists in Cherubin, was determined to\nbe vexed, and was jealous of his own shadow. It is thus, in fact, that\nthe harsh and capricious jealousy of the flesh awakens in the human\nheart, and takes possession of it, even without any right. Moreover,\nsetting aside even that jealousy, the sight of that charming leg had\ncontained nothing agreeable for him; the white stocking of the first\nwoman he chanced to meet would have afforded him more pleasure.\n\nWhen \"his Ursule,\" after having reached the end of the walk, retraced\nher steps with M. Leblanc, and passed in front of the bench on which\nMarius had seated himself once more, Marius darted a sullen and\nferocious glance at her. The young girl gave way to that slight\nstraightening up with a backward movement, accompanied by a raising of\nthe eyelids, which signifies: \"Well, what is the matter?\"\n\nThis was \"their first quarrel.\"\n\nMarius had hardly made this scene at her with his eyes, when some one\ncrossed the walk. It was a veteran, very much bent, extremely wrinkled,\nand pale, in a uniform of the Louis XV. pattern, bearing on his breast\nthe little oval plaque of red cloth, with the crossed swords, the\nsoldier's cross of Saint-Louis, and adorned, in addition, with a\ncoat-sleeve, which had no arm within it, with a silver chin and a wooden\nleg. Marius thought he perceived that this man had an extremely well\nsatisfied air. It even struck him that the aged cynic, as he hobbled\nalong past him, addressed to him a very fraternal and very merry wink,\nas though some chance had created an understanding between them, and as\nthough they had shared some piece of good luck together. What did that\nrelic of Mars mean by being so contented? What had passed between\nthat wooden leg and the other? Marius reached a paroxysm of\njealousy.--\"Perhaps he was there!\" he said to himself; \"perhaps he\nsaw!\"--And he felt a desire to exterminate the veteran.\n\nWith the aid of time, all points grow dull. Marius' wrath against\n\"Ursule,\" just and legitimate as it was, passed off. He finally pardoned\nher; but this cost him a great effort; he sulked for three days.\n\nNevertheless, in spite of all this, and because of all this, his passion\naugmented and grew to madness.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX--ECLIPSE\n\nThe reader has just seen how Marius discovered, or thought that he\ndiscovered, that She was named Ursule.\n\nAppetite grows with loving. To know that her name was Ursule was a great\ndeal; it was very little. In three or four weeks, Marius had devoured\nthis bliss. He wanted another. He wanted to know where she lived.\n\nHe had committed his first blunder, by falling into the ambush of the\nbench by the Gladiator. He had committed a second, by not remaining at\nthe Luxembourg when M. Leblanc came thither alone. He now committed a\nthird, and an immense one. He followed \"Ursule.\"\n\nShe lived in the Rue de l'Ouest, in the most unfrequented spot, in a\nnew, three-story house, of modest appearance.\n\nFrom that moment forth, Marius added to his happiness of seeing her at\nthe Luxembourg the happiness of following her home.\n\nHis hunger was increasing. He knew her first name, at least, a charming\nname, a genuine woman's name; he knew where she lived; he wanted to know\nwho she was.\n\nOne evening, after he had followed them to their dwelling, and had seen\nthem disappear through the carriage gate, he entered in their train and\nsaid boldly to the porter:--\n\n\"Is that the gentleman who lives on the first floor, who has just come\nin?\"\n\n\"No,\" replied the porter. \"He is the gentleman on the third floor.\"\n\nAnother step gained. This success emboldened Marius.\n\n\"On the front?\" he asked.\n\n\"Parbleu!\" said the porter, \"the house is only built on the street.\"\n\n\"And what is that gentleman's business?\" began Marius again.\n\n\"He is a gentleman of property, sir. A very kind man who does good to\nthe unfortunate, though not rich himself.\"\n\n\"What is his name?\" resumed Marius.\n\nThe porter raised his head and said:--\n\n\"Are you a police spy, sir?\"\n\nMarius went off quite abashed, but delighted. He was getting on.\n\n\"Good,\" thought he, \"I know that her name is Ursule, that she is the\ndaughter of a gentleman who lives on his income, and that she lives\nthere, on the third floor, in the Rue de l'Ouest.\"\n\nOn the following day, M. Leblanc and his daughter made only a very\nbrief stay in the Luxembourg; they went away while it was still broad\ndaylight. Marius followed them to the Rue de l'Ouest, as he had taken up\nthe habit of doing. On arriving at the carriage entrance M. Leblanc made\nhis daughter pass in first, then paused, before crossing the threshold,\nand stared intently at Marius.\n\nOn the next day they did not come to the Luxembourg. Marius waited for\nthem all day in vain.\n\nAt nightfall, he went to the Rue de l'Ouest, and saw a light in the\nwindows of the third story.\n\nHe walked about beneath the windows until the light was extinguished.\n\nThe next day, no one at the Luxembourg. Marius waited all day, then went\nand did sentinel duty under their windows. This carried him on to ten\no'clock in the evening.\n\nHis dinner took care of itself. Fever nourishes the sick man, and love\nthe lover.\n\nHe spent a week in this manner. M. Leblanc no longer appeared at the\nLuxembourg.\n\nMarius indulged in melancholy conjectures; he dared not watch the porte\ncochere during the day; he contented himself with going at night to gaze\nupon the red light of the windows. At times he saw shadows flit across\nthem, and his heart began to beat.\n\nOn the eighth day, when he arrived under the windows, there was no light\nin them.\n\n\"Hello!\" he said, \"the lamp is not lighted yet. But it is dark. Can they\nhave gone out?\" He waited until ten o'clock. Until midnight. Until one\nin the morning. Not a light appeared in the windows of the third story,\nand no one entered the house.\n\nHe went away in a very gloomy frame of mind.\n\nOn the morrow,--for he only existed from morrow to morrow, there was,\nso to speak, no to-day for him,--on the morrow, he found no one at the\nLuxembourg; he had expected this. At dusk, he went to the house.\n\nNo light in the windows; the shades were drawn; the third floor was\ntotally dark.\n\nMarius rapped at the porte cochere, entered, and said to the porter:--\n\n\"The gentleman on the third floor?\"\n\n\"Has moved away,\" replied the porter.\n\nMarius reeled and said feebly:--\n\n\"How long ago?\"\n\n\"Yesterday.\"\n\n\"Where is he living now?\"\n\n\"I don't know anything about it.\"\n\n\"So he has not left his new address?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\nAnd the porter, raising his eyes, recognized Marius.\n\n\"Come! So it's you!\" said he; \"but you are decidedly a spy then?\"\n\n\n\n\nBOOK SEVENTH.--PATRON MINETTE\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I--MINES AND MINERS\n\nHuman societies all have what is called in theatrical parlance, a third\nlower floor. The social soil is everywhere undermined, sometimes for\ngood, sometimes for evil. These works are superposed one upon the other.\nThere are superior mines and inferior mines. There is a top and a\nbottom in this obscure sub-soil, which sometimes gives way beneath\ncivilization, and which our indifference and heedlessness trample under\nfoot. The Encyclopedia, in the last century, was a mine that was\nalmost open to the sky. The shades, those sombre hatchers of primitive\nChristianity, only awaited an opportunity to bring about an explosion\nunder the Caesars and to inundate the human race with light. For in the\nsacred shadows there lies latent light. Volcanoes are full of a shadow\nthat is capable of flashing forth. Every form begins by being night. The\ncatacombs, in which the first mass was said, were not alone the cellar\nof Rome, they were the vaults of the world.\n\nBeneath the social construction, that complicated marvel of a structure,\nthere are excavations of all sorts. There is the religious mine, the\nphilosophical mine, the economic mine, the revolutionary mine. Such and\nsuch a pick-axe with the idea, such a pick with ciphers. Such another\nwith wrath. People hail and answer each other from one catacomb to\nanother. Utopias travel about underground, in the pipes. There they\nbranch out in every direction. They sometimes meet, and fraternize\nthere. Jean-Jacques lends his pick to Diogenes, who lends him his\nlantern. Sometimes they enter into combat there. Calvin seizes Socinius\nby the hair. But nothing arrests nor interrupts the tension of all these\nenergies toward the goal, and the vast, simultaneous activity, which\ngoes and comes, mounts, descends, and mounts again in these obscurities,\nand which immense unknown swarming slowly transforms the top and the\nbottom and the inside and the outside. Society hardly even suspects this\ndigging which leaves its surface intact and changes its bowels. There\nare as many different subterranean stages as there are varying works,\nas there are extractions. What emerges from these deep excavations? The\nfuture.\n\nThe deeper one goes, the more mysterious are the toilers. The work\nis good, up to a degree which the social philosophies are able to\nrecognize; beyond that degree it is doubtful and mixed; lower down,\nit becomes terrible. At a certain depth, the excavations are no longer\npenetrable by the spirit of civilization, the limit breathable by man\nhas been passed; a beginning of monsters is possible.\n\nThe descending scale is a strange one; and each one of the rungs of this\nladder corresponds to a stage where philosophy can find foothold, and\nwhere one encounters one of these workmen, sometimes divine, sometimes\nmisshapen. Below John Huss, there is Luther; below Luther, there is\nDescartes; below Descartes, there is Voltaire; below Voltaire, there\nis Condorcet; below Condorcet, there is Robespierre; below Robespierre,\nthere is Marat; below Marat there is Babeuf. And so it goes on. Lower\ndown, confusedly, at the limit which separates the indistinct from the\ninvisible, one perceives other gloomy men, who perhaps do not exist as\nyet. The men of yesterday are spectres; those of to-morrow are forms.\nThe eye of the spirit distinguishes them but obscurely. The embryonic\nwork of the future is one of the visions of philosophy.\n\nA world in limbo, in the state of foetus, what an unheard-of spectre!\n\nSaint-Simon, Owen, Fourier, are there also, in lateral galleries.\n\nSurely, although a divine and invisible chain unknown to themselves,\nbinds together all these subterranean pioneers who, almost always, think\nthemselves isolated, and who are not so, their works vary greatly, and\nthe light of some contrasts with the blaze of others. The first are\nparadisiacal, the last are tragic. Nevertheless, whatever may be the\ncontrast, all these toilers, from the highest to the most nocturnal,\nfrom the wisest to the most foolish, possess one likeness, and this\nis it: disinterestedness. Marat forgets himself like Jesus. They\nthrow themselves on one side, they omit themselves, they think not of\nthemselves. They have a glance, and that glance seeks the absolute. The\nfirst has the whole heavens in his eyes; the last, enigmatical though he\nmay be, has still, beneath his eyelids, the pale beam of the infinite.\nVenerate the man, whoever he may be, who has this sign--the starry eye.\n\nThe shadowy eye is the other sign.\n\nWith it, evil commences. Reflect and tremble in the presence of any one\nwho has no glance at all. The social order has its black miners.\n\nThere is a point where depth is tantamount to burial, and where light\nbecomes extinct.\n\nBelow all these mines which we have just mentioned, below all these\ngalleries, below this whole immense, subterranean, venous system of\nprogress and utopia, much further on in the earth, much lower than\nMarat, lower than Babeuf, lower, much lower, and without any connection\nwith the upper levels, there lies the last mine. A formidable spot. This\nis what we have designated as the le troisieme dessous. It is the grave\nof shadows. It is the cellar of the blind. Inferi.\n\nThis communicates with the abyss.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II--THE LOWEST DEPTHS\n\nThere disinterestedness vanishes. The demon is vaguely outlined; each\none is for himself. The _I_ in the eyes howls, seeks, fumbles, and\ngnaws. The social Ugolino is in this gulf.\n\nThe wild spectres who roam in this grave, almost beasts, almost\nphantoms, are not occupied with universal progress; they are ignorant\nboth of the idea and of the word; they take no thought for anything\nbut the satisfaction of their individual desires. They are almost\nunconscious, and there exists within them a sort of terrible\nobliteration. They have two mothers, both step-mothers, ignorance and\nmisery. They have a guide, necessity; and for all forms of satisfaction,\nappetite. They are brutally voracious, that is to say, ferocious, not\nafter the fashion of the tyrant, but after the fashion of the tiger.\nFrom suffering these spectres pass to crime; fatal affiliation, dizzy\ncreation, logic of darkness. That which crawls in the social third lower\nlevel is no longer complaint stifled by the absolute; it is the protest\nof matter. Man there becomes a dragon. To be hungry, to be thirsty--that\nis the point of departure; to be Satan--that is the point reached. From\nthat vault Lacenaire emerges.\n\nWe have just seen, in Book Fourth, one of the compartments of the\nupper mine, of the great political, revolutionary, and philosophical\nexcavation. There, as we have just said, all is pure, noble, dignified,\nhonest. There, assuredly, one might be misled; but error is worthy of\nveneration there, so thoroughly does it imply heroism. The work there\neffected, taken as a whole has a name: Progress.\n\nThe moment has now come when we must take a look at other depths,\nhideous depths. There exists beneath society, we insist upon this point,\nand there will exist, until that day when ignorance shall be dissipated,\nthe great cavern of evil.\n\nThis cavern is below all, and is the foe of all. It is hatred, without\nexception. This cavern knows no philosophers; its dagger has never cut\na pen. Its blackness has no connection with the sublime blackness of the\ninkstand. Never have the fingers of night which contract beneath this\nstifling ceiling, turned the leaves of a book nor unfolded a newspaper.\nBabeuf is a speculator to Cartouche; Marat is an aristocrat to\nSchinderhannes. This cavern has for its object the destruction of\neverything.\n\nOf everything. Including the upper superior mines, which it execrates.\nIt not only undermines, in its hideous swarming, the actual social\norder; it undermines philosophy, it undermines human thought, it\nundermines civilization, it undermines revolution, it undermines\nprogress. Its name is simply theft, prostitution, murder, assassination.\nIt is darkness, and it desires chaos. Its vault is formed of ignorance.\n\nAll the others, those above it, have but one object--to suppress it.\nIt is to this point that philosophy and progress tend, with all their\norgans simultaneously, by their amelioration of the real, as well as by\ntheir contemplation of the absolute. Destroy the cavern Ignorance and\nyou destroy the lair Crime.\n\nLet us condense, in a few words, a part of what we have just written.\nThe only social peril is darkness.\n\nHumanity is identity. All men are made of the same clay. There is no\ndifference, here below, at least, in predestination. The same shadow\nin front, the same flesh in the present, the same ashes afterwards. But\nignorance, mingled with the human paste, blackens it. This incurable\nblackness takes possession of the interior of a man and is there\nconverted into evil.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III--BABET, GUEULEMER, CLAQUESOUS, AND MONTPARNASSE\n\nA quartette of ruffians, Claquesous, Gueulemer, Babet, and Montparnasse\ngoverned the third lower floor of Paris, from 1830 to 1835.\n\nGueulemer was a Hercules of no defined position. For his lair he had the\nsewer of the Arche-Marion. He was six feet high, his pectoral muscles\nwere of marble, his biceps of brass, his breath was that of a cavern,\nhis torso that of a colossus, his head that of a bird. One thought one\nbeheld the Farnese Hercules clad in duck trousers and a cotton velvet\nwaistcoat. Gueulemer, built after this sculptural fashion, might have\nsubdued monsters; he had found it more expeditious to be one. A low\nbrow, large temples, less than forty years of age, but with crow's-feet,\nharsh, short hair, cheeks like a brush, a beard like that of a wild\nboar; the reader can see the man before him. His muscles called for\nwork, his stupidity would have none of it. He was a great, idle force.\nHe was an assassin through coolness. He was thought to be a creole. He\nhad, probably, somewhat to do with Marshal Brune, having been a porter\nat Avignon in 1815. After this stage, he had turned ruffian.\n\nThe diaphaneity of Babet contrasted with the grossness of Gueulemer.\nBabet was thin and learned. He was transparent but impenetrable.\nDaylight was visible through his bones, but nothing through his eyes. He\ndeclared that he was a chemist. He had been a jack of all trades. He had\nplayed in vaudeville at Saint-Mihiel. He was a man of purpose, a fine\ntalker, who underlined his smiles and accentuated his gestures. His\noccupation consisted in selling, in the open air, plaster busts and\nportraits of \"the head of the State.\" In addition to this, he extracted\nteeth. He had exhibited phenomena at fairs, and he had owned a booth\nwith a trumpet and this poster: \"Babet, Dental Artist, Member of the\nAcademies, makes physical experiments on metals and metalloids, extracts\nteeth, undertakes stumps abandoned by his brother practitioners. Price:\none tooth, one franc, fifty centimes; two teeth, two francs; three\nteeth, two francs, fifty. Take advantage of this opportunity.\" This Take\nadvantage of this opportunity meant: Have as many teeth extracted as\npossible. He had been married and had had children. He did not know what\nhad become of his wife and children. He had lost them as one loses his\nhandkerchief. Babet read the papers, a striking exception in the world\nto which he belonged. One day, at the period when he had his family with\nhim in his booth on wheels, he had read in the Messager, that a woman\nhad just given birth to a child, who was doing well, and had a calf's\nmuzzle, and he exclaimed: \"There's a fortune! my wife has not the wit to\npresent me with a child like that!\"\n\nLater on he had abandoned everything, in order to \"undertake Paris.\"\nThis was his expression.\n\nWho was Claquesous? He was night. He waited until the sky was daubed\nwith black, before he showed himself. At nightfall he emerged from the\nhole whither he returned before daylight. Where was this hole? No one\nknew. He only addressed his accomplices in the most absolute darkness,\nand with his back turned to them. Was his name Claquesous? Certainly\nnot. If a candle was brought, he put on a mask. He was a ventriloquist.\nBabet said: \"Claquesous is a nocturne for two voices.\" Claquesous was\nvague, terrible, and a roamer. No one was sure whether he had a name,\nClaquesous being a sobriquet; none was sure that he had a voice, as his\nstomach spoke more frequently than his voice; no one was sure that he\nhad a face, as he was never seen without his mask. He disappeared as\nthough he had vanished into thin air; when he appeared, it was as though\nhe sprang from the earth.\n\nA lugubrious being was Montparnasse. Montparnasse was a child; less than\ntwenty years of age, with a handsome face, lips like cherries, charming\nblack hair, the brilliant light of springtime in his eyes; he had all\nvices and aspired to all crimes.\n\nThe digestion of evil aroused in him an appetite for worse. It was the\nstreet boy turned pickpocket, and a pickpocket turned garroter. He was\ngenteel, effeminate, graceful, robust, sluggish, ferocious. The rim of\nhis hat was curled up on the left side, in order to make room for a tuft\nof hair, after the style of 1829. He lived by robbery with violence.\nHis coat was of the best cut, but threadbare. Montparnasse was a\nfashion-plate in misery and given to the commission of murders. The\ncause of all this youth's crimes was the desire to be well-dressed. The\nfirst grisette who had said to him: \"You are handsome!\" had cast the\nstain of darkness into his heart, and had made a Cain of this Abel.\nFinding that he was handsome, he desired to be elegant: now, the\nheight of elegance is idleness; idleness in a poor man means crime. Few\nprowlers were so dreaded as Montparnasse. At eighteen, he had already\nnumerous corpses in his past. More than one passer-by lay with\noutstretched arms in the presence of this wretch, with his face in a\npool of blood. Curled, pomaded, with laced waist, the hips of a woman,\nthe bust of a Prussian officer, the murmur of admiration from the\nboulevard wenches surrounding him, his cravat knowingly tied, a bludgeon\nin his pocket, a flower in his buttonhole; such was this dandy of the\nsepulchre.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV--COMPOSITION OF THE TROUPE\n\nThese four ruffians formed a sort of Proteus, winding like a serpent\namong the police, and striving to escape Vidocq's indiscreet glances\n\"under divers forms, tree, flame, fountain,\" lending each other their\nnames and their traps, hiding in their own shadows, boxes with\nsecret compartments and refuges for each other, stripping off their\npersonalities, as one removes his false nose at a masked ball, sometimes\nsimplifying matters to the point of consisting of but one individual,\nsometimes multiplying themselves to such a point that Coco-Latour\nhimself took them for a whole throng.\n\nThese four men were not four men; they were a sort of mysterious robber\nwith four heads, operating on a grand scale on Paris; they were that\nmonstrous polyp of evil, which inhabits the crypt of society.\n\nThanks to their ramifications, and to the network underlying their\nrelations, Babet, Gueulemer, Claquesous, and Montparnasse were charged\nwith the general enterprise of the ambushes of the department of\nthe Seine. The inventors of ideas of that nature, men with nocturnal\nimaginations, applied to them to have their ideas executed. They\nfurnished the canvas to the four rascals, and the latter undertook the\npreparation of the scenery. They labored at the stage setting. They were\nalways in a condition to lend a force proportioned and suitable to\nall crimes which demanded a lift of the shoulder, and which were\nsufficiently lucrative. When a crime was in quest of arms, they\nunder-let their accomplices. They kept a troupe of actors of the shadows\nat the disposition of all underground tragedies.\n\nThey were in the habit of assembling at nightfall, the hour when they\nwoke up, on the plains which adjoin the Salpetriere. There they held\ntheir conferences. They had twelve black hours before them; they\nregulated their employment accordingly.\n\nPatron-Minette,--such was the name which was bestowed in the\nsubterranean circulation on the association of these four men. In the\nfantastic, ancient, popular parlance, which is vanishing day by day,\nPatron-Minette signifies the morning, the same as entre chien et\nloup--between dog and wolf--signifies the evening. This appellation,\nPatron-Minette, was probably derived from the hour at which their work\nended, the dawn being the vanishing moment for phantoms and for the\nseparation of ruffians. These four men were known under this title.\nWhen the President of the Assizes visited Lacenaire in his prison, and\nquestioned him concerning a misdeed which Lacenaire denied, \"Who did\nit?\" demanded the President. Lacenaire made this response, enigmatical\nso far as the magistrate was concerned, but clear to the police:\n\"Perhaps it was Patron-Minette.\"\n\nA piece can sometimes be divined on the enunciation of the personages;\nin the same manner a band can almost be judged from the list of ruffians\ncomposing it. Here are the appellations to which the principal members\nof Patron-Minette answered,--for the names have survived in special\nmemoirs.\n\nPanchaud, alias Printanier, alias Bigrenaille.\n\nBrujon. [There was a Brujon dynasty; we cannot refrain from\ninterpolating this word.]\n\nBoulatruelle, the road-mender already introduced.\n\nLaveuve.\n\nFinistere.\n\nHomere-Hogu, a negro.\n\nMardisoir. (Tuesday evening.)\n\nDepeche. (Make haste.)\n\nFauntleroy, alias Bouquetiere (the Flower Girl).\n\nGlorieux, a discharged convict.\n\nBarrecarrosse (Stop-carriage), called Monsieur Dupont.\n\nL'Esplanade-du-Sud.\n\nPoussagrive.\n\nCarmagnolet.\n\nKruideniers, called Bizarro.\n\nMangedentelle. (Lace-eater.)\n\nLes-pieds-en-l'Air. (Feet in the air.)\n\nDemi-Liard, called Deux-Milliards.\n\nEtc., etc.\n\nWe pass over some, and not the worst of them. These names have faces\nattached. They do not express merely beings, but species. Each one of\nthese names corresponds to a variety of those misshapen fungi from the\nunder side of civilization.\n\nThose beings, who were not very lavish with their countenances, were not\namong the men whom one sees passing along the streets. Fatigued by the\nwild nights which they passed, they went off by day to sleep, sometimes\nin the lime-kilns, sometimes in the abandoned quarries of Montmatre or\nMontrouge, sometimes in the sewers. They ran to earth.\n\nWhat became of these men? They still exist. They have always existed.\nHorace speaks of them: Ambubaiarum collegia, pharmacopolae, mendici,\nmimae; and so long as society remains what it is, they will remain what\nthey are. Beneath the obscure roof of their cavern, they are continually\nborn again from the social ooze. They return, spectres, but always\nidentical; only, they no longer bear the same names and they are\nno longer in the same skins. The individuals extirpated, the tribe\nsubsists.\n\nThey always have the same faculties. From the vagrant to the tramp, the\nrace is maintained in its purity. They divine purses in pockets, they\nscent out watches in fobs. Gold and silver possess an odor for them.\nThere exist ingenuous bourgeois, of whom it might be said, that they\nhave a \"stealable\" air. These men patiently pursue these bourgeois. They\nexperience the quivers of a spider at the passage of a stranger or of a\nman from the country.\n\nThese men are terrible, when one encounters them, or catches a glimpse\nof them, towards midnight, on a deserted boulevard. They do not seem\nto be men but forms composed of living mists; one would say that they\nhabitually constitute one mass with the shadows, that they are in\nno wise distinct from them, that they possess no other soul than the\ndarkness, and that it is only momentarily and for the purpose of living\nfor a few minutes a monstrous life, that they have separated from the\nnight.\n\nWhat is necessary to cause these spectres to vanish? Light. Light in\nfloods. Not a single bat can resist the dawn. Light up society from\nbelow.\n\n\n\n\nBOOK EIGHTH.--THE WICKED POOR MAN\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I--MARIUS, WHILE SEEKING A GIRL IN A BONNET, ENCOUNTERS A MAN IN\nA CAP\n\nSummer passed, then the autumn; winter came. Neither M. Leblanc nor the\nyoung girl had again set foot in the Luxembourg garden. Thenceforth,\nMarius had but one thought,--to gaze once more on that sweet and\nadorable face. He sought constantly, he sought everywhere; he found\nnothing. He was no longer Marius, the enthusiastic dreamer, the firm,\nresolute, ardent man, the bold defier of fate, the brain which erected\nfuture on future, the young spirit encumbered with plans, with projects,\nwith pride, with ideas and wishes; he was a lost dog. He fell into a\nblack melancholy. All was over. Work disgusted him, walking tired him.\nVast nature, formerly so filled with forms, lights, voices, counsels,\nperspectives, horizons, teachings, now lay empty before him. It seemed\nto him that everything had disappeared.\n\nHe thought incessantly, for he could not do otherwise; but he no longer\ntook pleasure in his thoughts. To everything that they proposed to him\nin a whisper, he replied in his darkness: \"What is the use?\"\n\nHe heaped a hundred reproaches on himself. \"Why did I follow her? I\nwas so happy at the mere sight of her! She looked at me; was not that\nimmense? She had the air of loving me. Was not that everything? I wished\nto have, what? There was nothing after that. I have been absurd. It is\nmy own fault,\" etc., etc. Courfeyrac, to whom he confided nothing,--it\nwas his nature,--but who made some little guess at everything,--that was\nhis nature,--had begun by congratulating him on being in love, though he\nwas amazed at it; then, seeing Marius fall into this melancholy state,\nhe ended by saying to him: \"I see that you have been simply an animal.\nHere, come to the Chaumiere.\"\n\nOnce, having confidence in a fine September sun, Marius had allowed\nhimself to be taken to the ball at Sceaux by Courfeyrac, Bossuet, and\nGrantaire, hoping, what a dream! that he might, perhaps, find her there.\nOf course he did not see the one he sought.--\"But this is the place,\nall the same, where all lost women are found,\" grumbled Grantaire in an\naside. Marius left his friends at the ball and returned home on foot,\nalone, through the night, weary, feverish, with sad and troubled eyes,\nstunned by the noise and dust of the merry wagons filled with singing\ncreatures on their way home from the feast, which passed close to\nhim, as he, in his discouragement, breathed in the acrid scent of the\nwalnut-trees, along the road, in order to refresh his head.\n\nHe took to living more and more alone, utterly overwhelmed, wholly given\nup to his inward anguish, going and coming in his pain like the wolf in\nthe trap, seeking the absent one everywhere, stupefied by love.\n\nOn another occasion, he had an encounter which produced on him a\nsingular effect. He met, in the narrow streets in the vicinity of the\nBoulevard des Invalides, a man dressed like a workingman and wearing a\ncap with a long visor, which allowed a glimpse of locks of very\nwhite hair. Marius was struck with the beauty of this white hair, and\nscrutinized the man, who was walking slowly and as though absorbed in\npainful meditation. Strange to say, he thought that he recognized M.\nLeblanc. The hair was the same, also the profile, so far as the cap\npermitted a view of it, the mien identical, only more depressed. But why\nthese workingman's clothes? What was the meaning of this? What signified\nthat disguise? Marius was greatly astonished. When he recovered himself,\nhis first impulse was to follow the man; who knows whether he did not\nhold at last the clue which he was seeking? In any case, he must see the\nman near at hand, and clear up the mystery. But the idea occurred to him\ntoo late, the man was no longer there. He had turned into some little\nside street, and Marius could not find him. This encounter occupied\nhis mind for three days and then was effaced. \"After all,\" he said to\nhimself, \"it was probably only a resemblance.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II--TREASURE TROVE\n\nMarius had not left the Gorbeau house. He paid no attention to any one\nthere.\n\nAt that epoch, to tell the truth, there were no other inhabitants in the\nhouse, except himself and those Jondrettes whose rent he had once paid,\nwithout, moreover, ever having spoken to either father, mother, or\ndaughters. The other lodgers had moved away or had died, or had been\nturned out in default of payment.\n\nOne day during that winter, the sun had shown itself a little in the\nafternoon, but it was the 2d of February, that ancient Candlemas\nday whose treacherous sun, the precursor of a six weeks' cold spell,\ninspired Mathieu Laensberg with these two lines, which have with justice\nremained classic:--\n\n\n           Qu'il luise ou qu'il luiserne,\n           L'ours rentre dans en sa caverne.[26]\n\n\nMarius had just emerged from his: night was falling. It was the hour for\nhis dinner; for he had been obliged to take to dining again, alas! oh,\ninfirmities of ideal passions!\n\nHe had just crossed his threshold, where Ma'am Bougon was sweeping at\nthe moment, as she uttered this memorable monologue:--\n\n\"What is there that is cheap now? Everything is dear. There is nothing\nin the world that is cheap except trouble; you can get that for nothing,\nthe trouble of the world!\"\n\nMarius slowly ascended the boulevard towards the barrier, in order to\nreach the Rue Saint-Jacques. He was walking along with drooping head.\n\nAll at once, he felt some one elbow him in the dusk; he wheeled round,\nand saw two young girls clad in rags, the one tall and slim, the other a\nlittle shorter, who were passing rapidly, all out of breath, in terror,\nand with the appearance of fleeing; they had been coming to meet him,\nhad not seen him, and had jostled him as they passed. Through the\ntwilight, Marius could distinguish their livid faces, their wild heads,\ntheir dishevelled hair, their hideous bonnets, their ragged petticoats,\nand their bare feet. They were talking as they ran. The taller said in a\nvery low voice:--\n\n\"The bobbies have come. They came near nabbing me at the half-circle.\"\nThe other answered: \"I saw them. I bolted, bolted, bolted!\"\n\nThrough this repulsive slang, Marius understood that gendarmes or the\npolice had come near apprehending these two children, and that the\nlatter had escaped.\n\nThey plunged among the trees of the boulevard behind him, and there\ncreated, for a few minutes, in the gloom, a sort of vague white spot,\nthen disappeared.\n\nMarius had halted for a moment.\n\nHe was about to pursue his way, when his eye lighted on a little grayish\npackage lying on the ground at his feet. He stooped and picked it up. It\nwas a sort of envelope which appeared to contain papers.\n\n\"Good,\" he said to himself, \"those unhappy girls dropped it.\"\n\nHe retraced his steps, he called, he did not find them; he reflected\nthat they must already be far away, put the package in his pocket, and\nwent off to dine.\n\nOn the way, he saw in an alley of the Rue Mouffetard, a child's coffin,\ncovered with a black cloth resting on three chairs, and illuminated by a\ncandle. The two girls of the twilight recurred to his mind.\n\n\"Poor mothers!\" he thought. \"There is one thing sadder than to see one's\nchildren die; it is to see them leading an evil life.\"\n\nThen those shadows which had varied his melancholy vanished from his\nthoughts, and he fell back once more into his habitual preoccupations.\nHe fell to thinking once more of his six months of love and happiness\nin the open air and the broad daylight, beneath the beautiful trees of\nLuxembourg.\n\n\"How gloomy my life has become!\" he said to himself. \"Young girls are\nalways appearing to me, only formerly they were angels and now they are\nghouls.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III--QUADRIFRONS\n\nThat evening, as he was undressing preparatory to going to bed, his hand\ncame in contact, in the pocket of his coat, with the packet which he\nhad picked up on the boulevard. He had forgotten it. He thought that it\nwould be well to open it, and that this package might possibly contain\nthe address of the young girls, if it really belonged to them, and, in\nany case, the information necessary to a restitution to the person who\nhad lost it.\n\nHe opened the envelope.\n\nIt was not sealed and contained four letters, also unsealed.\n\nThey bore addresses.\n\nAll four exhaled a horrible odor of tobacco.\n\nThe first was addressed: \"To Madame, Madame la Marquise de Grucheray,\nthe place opposite the Chamber of Deputies, No.--\"\n\nMarius said to himself, that he should probably find in it the\ninformation which he sought, and that, moreover, the letter being open,\nit was probable that it could be read without impropriety.\n\nIt was conceived as follows:--\n\n\nMadame la Marquise: The virtue of clemency and piety is that which most\nclosely unites sosiety. Turn your Christian spirit and cast a look of\ncompassion on this unfortunate Spanish victim of loyalty and attachment\nto the sacred cause of legitimacy, who has given with his blood,\nconsecrated his fortune, evverything, to defend that cause, and to-day\nfinds himself in the greatest missery. He doubts not that your honorable\nperson will grant succor to preserve an existence exteremely painful for\na military man of education and honor full of wounds, counts in advance\non the humanity which animates you and on the interest which Madame la\nMarquise bears to a nation so unfortunate. Their prayer will not be in\nvain, and their gratitude will preserve theirs charming souvenir.\n\n My respectful sentiments, with which I have the honor to be\n                            Madame,\n                                 Don Alvares, Spanish Captain\n                                 of Cavalry, a royalist who\n                                 has take refuge in France,\n                                 who finds himself on travells\n                                 for his country, and the\n                                 resources are lacking him to\n                                 continue his travells.\n\n\nNo address was joined to the signature. Marius hoped to find the address\nin the second letter, whose superscription read: A Madame, Madame la\nComtesse de Montvernet, Rue Cassette, No. 9. This is what Marius read in\nit:--\n\n\n Madame la Comtesse:  It is an unhappy mother of a family of six\n children the last of which is only eight months old.  I sick\n since my last confinement, abandoned by my husband five months ago,\n haveing no resources in the world the most frightful indigance.\n\n In the hope of Madame la Comtesse, she has the honor to be,\n Madame, with profound respect,\n                                        Mistress Balizard.\n\n\nMarius turned to the third letter, which was a petition like the\npreceding; he read:--\n\n        Monsieur Pabourgeot, Elector, wholesale stocking merchant,\n           Rue Saint-Denis on the corner of the Rue aux Fers.\n\n I permit myself to address you this letter to beg you to grant me\n the pretious favor of your simpaties and to interest yourself in a man\n of letters who has just sent a drama to the Theatre-Francais. The subject\n is historical, and the action takes place in Auvergne in the time\n of the Empire; the style, I think, is natural, laconic, and may have\n some merit.  There are couplets to be sung in four places.  The comic,\n the serious, the unexpected, are mingled in a variety of characters,\n and a tinge of romanticism lightly spread through all the intrigue\n which proceeds misteriously, and ends, after striking altarations,\n in the midst of many beautiful strokes of brilliant scenes.\n\n My principal object is to satisfi the desire which progressively\n animates the man of our century, that is to say, the fashion,\n that capritious and bizarre weathervane which changes at almost\n every new wind.\n\n In spite of these qualities I have reason to fear that jealousy,\n the egotism of priviliged authors, may obtaine my exclusion from\n the theatre, for I am not ignorant of the mortifications with which\n new-comers are treated.\n\n Monsiuer Pabourgeot, your just reputation as an enlightened protector\n of men of litters emboldens me to send you my daughter who will\n explain our indigant situation to you, lacking bread and fire\n in this wynter season.  When I say to you that I beg you to accept\n the dedication of my drama which I desire to make to you and of all\n those that I shall make, is to prove to you how great is my ambition\n to have the honor of sheltering myself under your protection,\n and of adorning my writings with your name.  If you deign to honor\n me with the most modest offering, I shall immediately occupy myself\n in making a piesse of verse to pay you my tribute of gratitude.\n Which I shall endeavor to render this piesse as perfect as possible,\n will be sent to you before it is inserted at the beginning of the\n drama and delivered on the stage.\n                             To Monsieur\n                                and Madame Pabourgeot,\n                                   My most respectful complements,\n                                      Genflot, man of letters.\n       P. S. Even if it is only forty sous.\n\n Excuse me for sending my daughter and not presenting myself,\n but sad motives connected with the toilet do not permit me,\n alas! to go out.\n\n\nFinally, Marius opened the fourth letter. The address ran: To the\nbenevolent Gentleman of the church of Saint-Jacquesdu-haut-Pas. It\ncontained the following lines:--\n\n\n Benevolent Man:  If you deign to accompany my daughter, you will\n behold a misserable calamity, and I will show you my certificates.\n\n At the aspect of these writings your generous soul will be moved\n with a sentiment of obvious benevolence, for true philosophers\n always feel lively emotions.\n\n Admit, compassionate man, that it is necessary to suffer the most\n cruel need, and that it is very painful, for the sake of obtaining\n a little relief, to get oneself attested by the authorities as though\n one were not free to suffer and to die of inanition while waiting\n to have our misery relieved.  Destinies are very fatal for several\n and too prodigal or too protecting for others.\n\n I await your presence or your offering, if you deign to make one,\n and I beseech you to accept the respectful sentiments with which I\n have the honor to be,\n                       truly magnanimous man,\n                         your very humble\n                           and very obedient servant,\n                                        P. Fabantou, dramatic artist.\n\n\nAfter perusing these four letters, Marius did not find himself much\nfurther advanced than before.\n\nIn the first place, not one of the signers gave his address.\n\nThen, they seemed to come from four different individuals, Don Alveras,\nMistress Balizard, the poet Genflot, and dramatic artist Fabantou; but\nthe singular thing about these letters was, that all four were written\nby the same hand.\n\nWhat conclusion was to be drawn from this, except that they all come\nfrom the same person?\n\nMoreover, and this rendered the conjecture all the more probable, the\ncoarse and yellow paper was the same in all four, the odor of tobacco\nwas the same, and, although an attempt had been made to vary the\nstyle, the same orthographical faults were reproduced with the greatest\ntranquillity, and the man of letters Genflot was no more exempt from\nthem than the Spanish captain.\n\nIt was waste of trouble to try to solve this petty mystery. Had it not\nbeen a chance find, it would have borne the air of a mystification.\nMarius was too melancholy to take even a chance pleasantry well, and to\nlend himself to a game which the pavement of the street seemed desirous\nof playing with him. It seemed to him that he was playing the part of\nthe blind man in blind man's buff between the four letters, and that\nthey were making sport of him.\n\nNothing, however, indicated that these letters belonged to the two\nyoung girls whom Marius had met on the boulevard. After all, they were\nevidently papers of no value. Marius replaced them in their envelope,\nflung the whole into a corner and went to bed. About seven o'clock in\nthe morning, he had just risen and breakfasted, and was trying to settle\ndown to work, when there came a soft knock at his door.\n\nAs he owned nothing, he never locked his door, unless occasionally,\nthough very rarely, when he was engaged in some pressing work. Even when\nabsent he left his key in the lock. \"You will be robbed,\" said Ma'am\nBougon. \"Of what?\" said Marius. The truth is, however, that he had, one\nday, been robbed of an old pair of boots, to the great triumph of Ma'am\nBougon.\n\nThere came a second knock, as gentle as the first.\n\n\"Come in,\" said Marius.\n\nThe door opened.\n\n\"What do you want, Ma'am Bougon?\" asked Marius, without raising his eyes\nfrom the books and manuscripts on his table.\n\nA voice which did not belong to Ma'am Bougon replied:--\n\n\"Excuse me, sir--\"\n\nIt was a dull, broken, hoarse, strangled voice, the voice of an old man,\nroughened with brandy and liquor.\n\nMarius turned round hastily, and beheld a young girl.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV--A ROSE IN MISERY\n\n[Illustration: Rose in Misery  3b8-4-rose-in-misery]\n\nA very young girl was standing in the half-open door. The dormer window\nof the garret, through which the light fell, was precisely opposite\nthe door, and illuminated the figure with a wan light. She was a frail,\nemaciated, slender creature; there was nothing but a chemise and a\npetticoat upon that chilled and shivering nakedness. Her girdle was a\nstring, her head ribbon a string, her pointed shoulders emerged from her\nchemise, a blond and lymphatic pallor, earth-colored collar-bones, red\nhands, a half-open and degraded mouth, missing teeth, dull, bold, base\neyes; she had the form of a young girl who has missed her youth, and the\nlook of a corrupt old woman; fifty years mingled with fifteen; one of\nthose beings which are both feeble and horrible, and which cause those\nto shudder whom they do not cause to weep.\n\nMarius had risen, and was staring in a sort of stupor at this being, who\nwas almost like the forms of the shadows which traverse dreams.\n\nThe most heart-breaking thing of all was, that this young girl had not\ncome into the world to be homely. In her early childhood she must even\nhave been pretty. The grace of her age was still struggling against the\nhideous, premature decrepitude of debauchery and poverty. The remains of\nbeauty were dying away in that face of sixteen, like the pale sunlight\nwhich is extinguished under hideous clouds at dawn on a winter's day.\n\nThat face was not wholly unknown to Marius. He thought he remembered\nhaving seen it somewhere.\n\n\"What do you wish, Mademoiselle?\" he asked.\n\nThe young girl replied in her voice of a drunken convict:--\n\n\"Here is a letter for you, Monsieur Marius.\"\n\nShe called Marius by his name; he could not doubt that he was the person\nwhom she wanted; but who was this girl? How did she know his name?\n\nWithout waiting for him to tell her to advance, she entered. She entered\nresolutely, staring, with a sort of assurance that made the heart bleed,\nat the whole room and the unmade bed. Her feet were bare. Large holes\nin her petticoat permitted glimpses of her long legs and her thin knees.\nShe was shivering.\n\nShe held a letter in her hand, which she presented to Marius.\n\nMarius, as he opened the letter, noticed that the enormous wafer which\nsealed it was still moist. The message could not have come from a\ndistance. He read:--\n\n\n My amiable neighbor, young man:  I have learned of your goodness to me,\n that you paid my rent six months ago.  I bless you, young man.\n My eldest daughter will tell you that we have been without a morsel\n of bread for two days, four persons and my spouse ill.  If I am\n not deseaved in my opinion, I think I may hope that your generous\n heart will melt at this statement and the desire will subjugate you\n to be propitious to me by daigning to lavish on me a slight favor.\n\n I am with the distinguished consideration which is due to the\n benefactors of humanity,--\n\n Jondrette.\n\n P.S. My eldest daughter will await your orders, dear Monsieur Marius.\n\n\nThis letter, coming in the very midst of the mysterious adventure which\nhad occupied Marius' thoughts ever since the preceding evening, was like\na candle in a cellar. All was suddenly illuminated.\n\nThis letter came from the same place as the other four. There was the\nsame writing, the same style, the same orthography, the same paper, the\nsame odor of tobacco.\n\nThere were five missives, five histories, five signatures, and a single\nsigner. The Spanish Captain Don Alvares, the unhappy Mistress Balizard,\nthe dramatic poet Genflot, the old comedian Fabantou, were all four\nnamed Jondrette, if, indeed, Jondrette himself were named Jondrette.\n\nMarius had lived in the house for a tolerably long time, and he had had,\nas we have said, but very rare occasion to see, to even catch a glimpse\nof, his extremely mean neighbors. His mind was elsewhere, and where the\nmind is, there the eyes are also. He had been obliged more than once to\npass the Jondrettes in the corridor or on the stairs; but they were mere\nforms to him; he had paid so little heed to them, that, on the preceding\nevening, he had jostled the Jondrette girls on the boulevard, without\nrecognizing them, for it had evidently been they, and it was with great\ndifficulty that the one who had just entered his room had awakened in\nhim, in spite of disgust and pity, a vague recollection of having met\nher elsewhere.\n\nNow he saw everything clearly. He understood that his neighbor\nJondrette, in his distress, exercised the industry of speculating on the\ncharity of benevolent persons, that he procured addresses, and that he\nwrote under feigned names to people whom he judged to be wealthy and\ncompassionate, letters which his daughters delivered at their risk\nand peril, for this father had come to such a pass, that he risked his\ndaughters; he was playing a game with fate, and he used them as the\nstake. Marius understood that probably, judging from their flight on the\nevening before, from their breathless condition, from their terror\nand from the words of slang which he had overheard, these unfortunate\ncreatures were plying some inexplicably sad profession, and that the\nresult of the whole was, in the midst of human society, as it is now\nconstituted, two miserable beings who were neither girls nor women, a\nspecies of impure and innocent monsters produced by misery.\n\nSad creatures, without name, or sex, or age, to whom neither good nor\nevil were any longer possible, and who, on emerging from childhood,\nhave already nothing in this world, neither liberty, nor virtue, nor\nresponsibility. Souls which blossomed out yesterday, and are faded\nto-day, like those flowers let fall in the streets, which are soiled\nwith every sort of mire, while waiting for some wheel to crush them.\nNevertheless, while Marius bent a pained and astonished gaze on her, the\nyoung girl was wandering back and forth in the garret with the audacity\nof a spectre. She kicked about, without troubling herself as to her\nnakedness. Occasionally her chemise, which was untied and torn, fell\nalmost to her waist. She moved the chairs about, she disarranged the\ntoilet articles which stood on the commode, she handled Marius' clothes,\nshe rummaged about to see what there was in the corners.\n\n\"Hullo!\" said she, \"you have a mirror!\"\n\nAnd she hummed scraps of vaudevilles, as though she had been alone,\nfrolicsome refrains which her hoarse and guttural voice rendered\nlugubrious.\n\nAn indescribable constraint, weariness, and humiliation were perceptible\nbeneath this hardihood. Effrontery is a disgrace.\n\nNothing could be more melancholy than to see her sport about the room,\nand, so to speak, flit with the movements of a bird which is frightened\nby the daylight, or which has broken its wing. One felt that under other\nconditions of education and destiny, the gay and over-free mien of this\nyoung girl might have turned out sweet and charming. Never, even among\nanimals, does the creature born to be a dove change into an osprey. That\nis only to be seen among men.\n\nMarius reflected, and allowed her to have her way.\n\nShe approached the table.\n\n\"Ah!\" said she, \"books!\"\n\nA flash pierced her glassy eye. She resumed, and her accent expressed\nthe happiness which she felt in boasting of something, to which no human\ncreature is insensible:--\n\n\"I know how to read, I do!\"\n\nShe eagerly seized a book which lay open on the table, and read with\ntolerable fluency:--\n\n\"--General Bauduin received orders to take the chateau of Hougomont\nwhich stands in the middle of the plain of Waterloo, with five\nbattalions of his brigade.\"\n\nShe paused.\n\n\"Ah! Waterloo! I know about that. It was a battle long ago. My father\nwas there. My father has served in the armies. We are fine Bonapartists\nin our house, that we are! Waterloo was against the English.\"\n\nShe laid down the book, caught up a pen, and exclaimed:--\n\n\"And I know how to write, too!\"\n\nShe dipped her pen in the ink, and turning to Marius:--\n\n\"Do you want to see? Look here, I'm going to write a word to show you.\"\n\nAnd before he had time to answer, she wrote on a sheet of white paper,\nwhich lay in the middle of the table: \"The bobbies are here.\"\n\nThen throwing down the pen:--\n\n\"There are no faults of orthography. You can look. We have received an\neducation, my sister and I. We have not always been as we are now. We\nwere not made--\"\n\nHere she paused, fixed her dull eyes on Marius, and burst out laughing,\nsaying, with an intonation which contained every form of anguish,\nstifled by every form of cynicism:--\n\n\"Bah!\"\n\nAnd she began to hum these words to a gay air:--\n\n      \"J'ai faim, mon pere.\"      I am hungry, father.\n       Pas de fricot.             I have no food.\n       J'ai froid, ma mere.       I am cold, mother.\n       Pas de tricot.             I have no clothes.\n       Grelotte,                  Lolotte!\n            Lolotte!                   Shiver,\n            Sanglote,                  Sob,\n            Jacquot!\"                  Jacquot!\"\n\n\nShe had hardly finished this couplet, when she exclaimed:--\n\n\"Do you ever go to the play, Monsieur Marius? I do. I have a little\nbrother who is a friend of the artists, and who gives me tickets\nsometimes. But I don't like the benches in the galleries. One is cramped\nand uncomfortable there. There are rough people there sometimes; and\npeople who smell bad.\"\n\nThen she scrutinized Marius, assumed a singular air and said:--\n\n\"Do you know, Mr. Marius, that you are a very handsome fellow?\"\n\nAnd at the same moment the same idea occurred to them both, and made\nher smile and him blush. She stepped up to him, and laid her hand on his\nshoulder: \"You pay no heed to me, but I know you, Mr. Marius. I meet you\nhere on the staircase, and then I often see you going to a person named\nFather Mabeuf who lives in the direction of Austerlitz, sometimes when I\nhave been strolling in that quarter. It is very becoming to you to have\nyour hair tumbled thus.\"\n\nShe tried to render her voice soft, but only succeeded in making it very\ndeep. A portion of her words was lost in the transit from her larynx to\nher lips, as though on a piano where some notes are missing.\n\nMarius had retreated gently.\n\n\"Mademoiselle,\" said he, with his cool gravity, \"I have here a package\nwhich belongs to you, I think. Permit me to return it to you.\"\n\nAnd he held out the envelope containing the four letters.\n\nShe clapped her hands and exclaimed:--\n\n\"We have been looking everywhere for that!\"\n\nThen she eagerly seized the package and opened the envelope, saying as\nshe did so:--\n\n\"Dieu de Dieu! how my sister and I have hunted! And it was you who found\nit! On the boulevard, was it not? It must have been on the boulevard?\nYou see, we let it fall when we were running. It was that brat of a\nsister of mine who was so stupid. When we got home, we could not find it\nanywhere. As we did not wish to be beaten, as that is useless, as that\nis entirely useless, as that is absolutely useless, we said that we had\ncarried the letters to the proper persons, and that they had said to us:\n'Nix.' So here they are, those poor letters! And how did you find out\nthat they belonged to me? Ah! yes, the writing. So it was you that we\njostled as we passed last night. We couldn't see. I said to my sister:\n'Is it a gentleman?' My sister said to me: 'I think it is a gentleman.'\"\n\nIn the meanwhile she had unfolded the petition addressed to \"the\nbenevolent gentleman of the church of Saint-Jacquesdu-Haut-Pas.\"\n\n\"Here!\" said she, \"this is for that old fellow who goes to mass. By the\nway, this is his hour. I'll go and carry it to him. Perhaps he will give\nus something to breakfast on.\"\n\nThen she began to laugh again, and added:--\n\n\"Do you know what it will mean if we get a breakfast today? It will mean\nthat we shall have had our breakfast of the day before yesterday, our\nbreakfast of yesterday, our dinner of to-day, and all that at once, and\nthis morning. Come! Parbleu! if you are not satisfied, dogs, burst!\"\n\nThis reminded Marius of the wretched girl's errand to himself. He\nfumbled in his waistcoat pocket, and found nothing there.\n\nThe young girl went on, and seemed to have no consciousness of Marius'\npresence.\n\n\"I often go off in the evening. Sometimes I don't come home again. Last\nwinter, before we came here, we lived under the arches of the bridges.\nWe huddled together to keep from freezing. My little sister cried. How\nmelancholy the water is! When I thought of drowning myself, I said\nto myself: 'No, it's too cold.' I go out alone, whenever I choose, I\nsometimes sleep in the ditches. Do you know, at night, when I walk along\nthe boulevard, I see the trees like forks, I see houses, all black and\nas big as Notre Dame, I fancy that the white walls are the river, I say\nto myself: 'Why, there's water there!' The stars are like the lamps in\nilluminations, one would say that they smoked and that the wind blew\nthem out, I am bewildered, as though horses were breathing in my ears;\nalthough it is night, I hear hand-organs and spinning-machines, and I\ndon't know what all. I think people are flinging stones at me, I flee\nwithout knowing whither, everything whirls and whirls. You feel very\nqueer when you have had no food.\"\n\nAnd then she stared at him with a bewildered air.\n\nBy dint of searching and ransacking his pockets, Marius had finally\ncollected five francs sixteen sous. This was all he owned in the world\nfor the moment. \"At all events,\" he thought, \"there is my dinner for\nto-day, and to-morrow we will see.\" He kept the sixteen sous, and handed\nthe five francs to the young girl.\n\nShe seized the coin.\n\n\"Good!\" said she, \"the sun is shining!\"\n\nAnd, as though the sun had possessed the property of melting the\navalanches of slang in her brain, she went on:--\n\n\"Five francs! the shiner! a monarch! in this hole! Ain't this fine!\nYou're a jolly thief! I'm your humble servant! Bravo for the good\nfellows! Two days' wine! and meat! and stew! we'll have a royal feast!\nand a good fill!\"\n\nShe pulled her chemise up on her shoulders, made a low bow to Marius,\nthen a familiar sign with her hand, and went towards the door, saying:--\n\n\"Good morning, sir. It's all right. I'll go and find my old man.\"\n\nAs she passed, she caught sight of a dry crust of bread on the commode,\nwhich was moulding there amid the dust; she flung herself upon it and\nbit into it, muttering:--\n\n\"That's good! it's hard! it breaks my teeth!\"\n\nThen she departed.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V--A PROVIDENTIAL PEEP-HOLE\n\nMarius had lived for five years in poverty, in destitution, even in\ndistress, but he now perceived that he had not known real misery. True\nmisery he had but just had a view of. It was its spectre which had just\npassed before his eyes. In fact, he who has only beheld the misery of\nman has seen nothing; the misery of woman is what he must see; he who\nhas seen only the misery of woman has seen nothing; he must see the\nmisery of the child.\n\nWhen a man has reached his last extremity, he has reached his last\nresources at the same time. Woe to the defenceless beings who surround\nhim! Work, wages, bread, fire, courage, good will, all fail him\nsimultaneously. The light of day seems extinguished without, the moral\nlight within; in these shadows man encounters the feebleness of the\nwoman and the child, and bends them violently to ignominy.\n\nThen all horrors become possible. Despair is surrounded with fragile\npartitions which all open on either vice or crime.\n\nHealth, youth, honor, all the shy delicacies of the young body, the\nheart, virginity, modesty, that epidermis of the soul, are manipulated\nin sinister wise by that fumbling which seeks resources, which\nencounters opprobrium, and which accommodates itself to it. Fathers,\nmothers, children, brothers, sisters, men, women, daughters, adhere\nand become incorporated, almost like a mineral formation, in that dusky\npromiscuousness of sexes, relationships, ages, infamies, and innocences.\nThey crouch, back to back, in a sort of hut of fate. They exchange\nwoe-begone glances. Oh, the unfortunate wretches! How pale they are! How\ncold they are! It seems as though they dwelt in a planet much further\nfrom the sun than ours.\n\nThis young girl was to Marius a sort of messenger from the realm of sad\nshadows. She revealed to him a hideous side of the night.\n\nMarius almost reproached himself for the preoccupations of revery and\npassion which had prevented his bestowing a glance on his neighbors up\nto that day. The payment of their rent had been a mechanical movement,\nwhich any one would have yielded to; but he, Marius, should have done\nbetter than that. What! only a wall separated him from those abandoned\nbeings who lived gropingly in the dark outside the pale of the rest of\nthe world, he was elbow to elbow with them, he was, in some sort, the\nlast link of the human race which they touched, he heard them live, or\nrather, rattle in the death agony beside him, and he paid no heed to\nthem! Every day, every instant, he heard them walking on the other side\nof the wall, he heard them go, and come, and speak, and he did not even\nlend an ear! And groans lay in those words, and he did not even listen\nto them, his thoughts were elsewhere, given up to dreams, to impossible\nradiances, to loves in the air, to follies; and all the while, human\ncreatures, his brothers in Jesus Christ, his brothers in the people,\nwere agonizing in vain beside him! He even formed a part of their\nmisfortune, and he aggravated it. For if they had had another neighbor\nwho was less chimerical and more attentive, any ordinary and charitable\nman, evidently their indigence would have been noticed, their signals of\ndistress would have been perceived, and they would have been taken hold\nof and rescued! They appeared very corrupt and very depraved, no\ndoubt, very vile, very odious even; but those who fall without becoming\ndegraded are rare; besides, there is a point where the unfortunate and\nthe infamous unite and are confounded in a single word, a fatal word,\nthe miserable; whose fault is this? And then should not the charity be\nall the more profound, in proportion as the fall is great?\n\nWhile reading himself this moral lesson, for there were occasions on\nwhich Marius, like all truly honest hearts, was his own pedagogue and\nscolded himself more than he deserved, he stared at the wall which\nseparated him from the Jondrettes, as though he were able to make his\ngaze, full of pity, penetrate that partition and warm these wretched\npeople. The wall was a thin layer of plaster upheld by lathes and beams,\nand, as the reader had just learned, it allowed the sound of voices and\nwords to be clearly distinguished. Only a man as dreamy as Marius could\nhave failed to perceive this long before. There was no paper pasted on\nthe wall, either on the side of the Jondrettes or on that of Marius; the\ncoarse construction was visible in its nakedness. Marius examined the\npartition, almost unconsciously; sometimes revery examines, observes,\nand scrutinizes as thought would. All at once he sprang up; he had just\nperceived, near the top, close to the ceiling, a triangular hole, which\nresulted from the space between three lathes. The plaster which should\nhave filled this cavity was missing, and by mounting on the commode,\na view could be had through this aperture into the Jondrettes' attic.\nCommiseration has, and should have, its curiosity. This aperture formed\na sort of peep-hole. It is permissible to gaze at misfortune like a\ntraitor in order to succor it.[27]\n\n\"Let us get some little idea of what these people are like,\" thought\nMarius, \"and in what condition they are.\"\n\nHe climbed upon the commode, put his eye to the crevice, and looked.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI--THE WILD MAN IN HIS LAIR\n\nCities, like forests, have their caverns in which all the most wicked\nand formidable creatures which they contain conceal themselves. Only,\nin cities, that which thus conceals itself is ferocious, unclean, and\npetty, that is to say, ugly; in forests, that which conceals itself is\nferocious, savage, and grand, that is to say, beautiful. Taking one lair\nwith another, the beast's is preferable to the man's. Caverns are better\nthan hovels.\n\nWhat Marius now beheld was a hovel.\n\nMarius was poor, and his chamber was poverty-stricken, but as his\npoverty was noble, his garret was neat. The den upon which his eye now\nrested was abject, dirty, fetid, pestiferous, mean, sordid. The only\nfurniture consisted of a straw chair, an infirm table, some old bits of\ncrockery, and in two of the corners, two indescribable pallets; all\nthe light was furnished by a dormer window of four panes, draped with\nspiders' webs. Through this aperture there penetrated just enough light\nto make the face of a man appear like the face of a phantom. The walls\nhad a leprous aspect, and were covered with seams and scars, like a\nvisage disfigured by some horrible malady; a repulsive moisture exuded\nfrom them. Obscene sketches roughly sketched with charcoal could be\ndistinguished upon them.\n\nThe chamber which Marius occupied had a dilapidated brick pavement; this\none was neither tiled nor planked; its inhabitants stepped directly\non the antique plaster of the hovel, which had grown black under the\nlong-continued pressure of feet. Upon this uneven floor, where the dirt\nseemed to be fairly incrusted, and which possessed but one virginity,\nthat of the broom, were capriciously grouped constellations of old\nshoes, socks, and repulsive rags; however, this room had a fireplace,\nso it was let for forty francs a year. There was every sort of thing\nin that fireplace, a brazier, a pot, broken boards, rags suspended\nfrom nails, a bird-cage, ashes, and even a little fire. Two brands were\nsmouldering there in a melancholy way.\n\nOne thing which added still more to the horrors of this garret was, that\nit was large. It had projections and angles and black holes, the lower\nsides of roofs, bays, and promontories. Hence horrible, unfathomable\nnooks where it seemed as though spiders as big as one's fist, wood-lice\nas large as one's foot, and perhaps even--who knows?--some monstrous\nhuman beings, must be hiding.\n\nOne of the pallets was near the door, the other near the window. One\nend of each touched the fireplace and faced Marius. In a corner near the\naperture through which Marius was gazing, a colored engraving in a black\nframe was suspended to a nail on the wall, and at its bottom, in large\nletters, was the inscription: THE DREAM. This represented a sleeping\nwoman, and a child, also asleep, the child on the woman's lap, an eagle\nin a cloud, with a crown in his beak, and the woman thrusting the\ncrown away from the child's head, without awaking the latter; in the\nbackground, Napoleon in a glory, leaning on a very blue column with a\nyellow capital ornamented with this inscription:\n\n                            MARINGO\n                           AUSTERLITS\n                              IENA\n                            WAGRAMME\n                              ELOT\n\nBeneath this frame, a sort of wooden panel, which was no longer than it\nwas broad, stood on the ground and rested in a sloping attitude against\nthe wall. It had the appearance of a picture with its face turned to\nthe wall, of a frame probably showing a daub on the other side, of some\npier-glass detached from a wall and lying forgotten there while waiting\nto be rehung.\n\nNear the table, upon which Marius descried a pen, ink, and paper, sat\na man about sixty years of age, small, thin, livid, haggard, with a\ncunning, cruel, and uneasy air; a hideous scoundrel.\n\nIf Lavater had studied this visage, he would have found the vulture\nmingled with the attorney there, the bird of prey and the pettifogger\nrendering each other mutually hideous and complementing each other; the\npettifogger making the bird of prey ignoble, the bird of prey making the\npettifogger horrible.\n\nThis man had a long gray beard. He was clad in a woman's chemise, which\nallowed his hairy breast and his bare arms, bristling with gray hair,\nto be seen. Beneath this chemise, muddy trousers and boots through which\nhis toes projected were visible.\n\nHe had a pipe in his mouth and was smoking. There was no bread in the\nhovel, but there was still tobacco.\n\nHe was writing probably some more letters like those which Marius had\nread.\n\nOn the corner of the table lay an ancient, dilapidated, reddish volume,\nand the size, which was the antique 12mo of reading-rooms, betrayed a\nromance. On the cover sprawled the following title, printed in large\ncapitals: GOD; THE KING; HONOR AND THE LADIES; BY DUCRAY DUMINIL, 1814.\n\nAs the man wrote, he talked aloud, and Marius heard his words:--\n\n\"The idea that there is no equality, even when you are dead! Just look\nat Pere Lachaise! The great, those who are rich, are up above, in the\nacacia alley, which is paved. They can reach it in a carriage. The\nlittle people, the poor, the unhappy, well, what of them? they are put\ndown below, where the mud is up to your knees, in the damp places. They\nare put there so that they will decay the sooner! You cannot go to see\nthem without sinking into the earth.\"\n\nHe paused, smote the table with his fist, and added, as he ground his\nteeth:--\n\n\"Oh! I could eat the whole world!\"\n\nA big woman, who might be forty years of age, or a hundred, was\ncrouching near the fireplace on her bare heels.\n\nShe, too, was clad only in a chemise and a knitted petticoat patched\nwith bits of old cloth. A coarse linen apron concealed the half of her\npetticoat. Although this woman was doubled up and bent together, it\ncould be seen that she was of very lofty stature. She was a sort of\ngiant, beside her husband. She had hideous hair, of a reddish blond\nwhich was turning gray, and which she thrust back from time to time,\nwith her enormous shining hands, with their flat nails.\n\nBeside her, on the floor, wide open, lay a book of the same form as the\nother, and probably a volume of the same romance.\n\nOn one of the pallets, Marius caught a glimpse of a sort of tall pale\nyoung girl, who sat there half naked and with pendant feet, and who did\nnot seem to be listening or seeing or living.\n\nNo doubt the younger sister of the one who had come to his room.\n\nShe seemed to be eleven or twelve years of age. On closer scrutiny it\nwas evident that she really was fourteen. She was the child who had\nsaid, on the boulevard the evening before: \"I bolted, bolted, bolted!\"\n\nShe was of that puny sort which remains backward for a long time,\nthen suddenly starts up rapidly. It is indigence which produces these\nmelancholy human plants. These creatures have neither childhood nor\nyouth. At fifteen years of age they appear to be twelve, at sixteen they\nseem twenty. To-day a little girl, to-morrow a woman. One might say\nthat they stride through life, in order to get through with it the more\nspeedily.\n\nAt this moment, this being had the air of a child.\n\nMoreover, no trace of work was revealed in that dwelling; no handicraft,\nno spinning-wheel, not a tool. In one corner lay some ironmongery of\ndubious aspect. It was the dull listlessness which follows despair and\nprecedes the death agony.\n\nMarius gazed for a while at this gloomy interior, more terrifying than\nthe interior of a tomb, for the human soul could be felt fluttering\nthere, and life was palpitating there. The garret, the cellar, the lowly\nditch where certain indigent wretches crawl at the very bottom of the\nsocial edifice, is not exactly the sepulchre, but only its antechamber;\nbut, as the wealthy display their greatest magnificence at the entrance\nof their palaces, it seems that death, which stands directly side by\nside with them, places its greatest miseries in that vestibule.\n\nThe man held his peace, the woman spoke no word, the young girl did\nnot even seem to breathe. The scratching of the pen on the paper was\naudible.\n\nThe man grumbled, without pausing in his writing. \"Canaille! canaille!\neverybody is canaille!\"\n\nThis variation to Solomon's exclamation elicited a sigh from the woman.\n\n\"Calm yourself, my little friend,\" she said. \"Don't hurt yourself, my\ndear. You are too good to write to all those people, husband.\"\n\nBodies press close to each other in misery, as in cold, but hearts draw\napart. This woman must have loved this man, to all appearance, judging\nfrom the amount of love within her; but probably, in the daily and\nreciprocal reproaches of the horrible distress which weighed on the\nwhole group, this had become extinct. There no longer existed in her\nanything more than the ashes of affection for her husband. Nevertheless,\ncaressing appellations had survived, as is often the case. She called\nhim: My dear, my little friend, my good man, etc., with her mouth while\nher heart was silent.\n\nThe man resumed his writing.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII--STRATEGY AND TACTICS\n\nMarius, with a load upon his breast, was on the point of descending\nfrom the species of observatory which he had improvised, when a sound\nattracted his attention and caused him to remain at his post.\n\nThe door of the attic had just burst open abruptly. The eldest girl made\nher appearance on the threshold. On her feet, she had large, coarse,\nmen's shoes, bespattered with mud, which had splashed even to her red\nankles, and she was wrapped in an old mantle which hung in tatters.\nMarius had not seen it on her an hour previously, but she had probably\ndeposited it at his door, in order that she might inspire the more pity,\nand had picked it up again on emerging. She entered, pushed the door to\nbehind her, paused to take breath, for she was completely breathless,\nthen exclaimed with an expression of triumph and joy:--\n\n\"He is coming!\"\n\nThe father turned his eyes towards her, the woman turned her head, the\nlittle sister did not stir.\n\n\"Who?\" demanded her father.\n\n\"The gentleman!\"\n\n\"The philanthropist?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"From the church of Saint-Jacques?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"That old fellow?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"And he is coming?\"\n\n\"He is following me.\"\n\n\"You are sure?\"\n\n\"I am sure.\"\n\n\"There, truly, he is coming?\"\n\n\"He is coming in a fiacre.\"\n\n\"In a fiacre. He is Rothschild.\"\n\nThe father rose.\n\n\"How are you sure? If he is coming in a fiacre, how is it that you\narrive before him? You gave him our address at least? Did you tell him\nthat it was the last door at the end of the corridor, on the right? If\nhe only does not make a mistake! So you found him at the church? Did he\nread my letter? What did he say to you?\"\n\n\"Ta, ta, ta,\" said the girl, \"how you do gallop on, my good man! See\nhere: I entered the church, he was in his usual place, I made him a\nreverence, and I handed him the letter; he read it and said to me:\n'Where do you live, my child?' I said: 'Monsieur, I will show you.' He\nsaid to me: 'No, give me your address, my daughter has some purchases to\nmake, I will take a carriage and reach your house at the same time that\nyou do.' I gave him the address. When I mentioned the house, he seemed\nsurprised and hesitated for an instant, then he said: 'Never mind, I\nwill come.' When the mass was finished, I watched him leave the church\nwith his daughter, and I saw them enter a carriage. I certainly did tell\nhim the last door in the corridor, on the right.\"\n\n\"And what makes you think that he will come?\"\n\n\"I have just seen the fiacre turn into the Rue Petit-Banquier. That is\nwhat made me run so.\"\n\n\"How do you know that it was the same fiacre?\"\n\n\"Because I took notice of the number, so there!\"\n\n\"What was the number?\"\n\n\"440.\"\n\n\"Good, you are a clever girl.\"\n\nThe girl stared boldly at her father, and showing the shoes which she\nhad on her feet:--\n\n\"A clever girl, possibly; but I tell you I won't put these shoes on\nagain, and that I won't, for the sake of my health, in the first place,\nand for the sake of cleanliness, in the next. I don't know anything\nmore irritating than shoes that squelch, and go ghi, ghi, ghi, the whole\ntime. I prefer to go barefoot.\"\n\n\"You are right,\" said her father, in a sweet tone which contrasted with\nthe young girl's rudeness, \"but then, you will not be allowed to enter\nchurches, for poor people must have shoes to do that. One cannot go\nbarefoot to the good God,\" he added bitterly.\n\nThen, returning to the subject which absorbed him:--\n\n\"So you are sure that he will come?\"\n\n\"He is following on my heels,\" said she.\n\nThe man started up. A sort of illumination appeared on his countenance.\n\n\"Wife!\" he exclaimed, \"you hear. Here is the philanthropist. Extinguish\nthe fire.\"\n\nThe stupefied mother did not stir.\n\nThe father, with the agility of an acrobat, seized a broken-nosed jug\nwhich stood on the chimney, and flung the water on the brands.\n\nThen, addressing his eldest daughter:--\n\n\"Here you! Pull the straw off that chair!\"\n\nHis daughter did not understand.\n\nHe seized the chair, and with one kick he rendered it seatless. His leg\npassed through it.\n\nAs he withdrew his leg, he asked his daughter:--\n\n\"Is it cold?\"\n\n\"Very cold. It is snowing.\"\n\nThe father turned towards the younger girl who sat on the bed near the\nwindow, and shouted to her in a thundering voice:--\n\n\"Quick! get off that bed, you lazy thing! will you never do anything?\nBreak a pane of glass!\"\n\nThe little girl jumped off the bed with a shiver.\n\n\"Break a pane!\" he repeated.\n\nThe child stood still in bewilderment.\n\n\"Do you hear me?\" repeated her father, \"I tell you to break a pane!\"\n\nThe child, with a sort of terrified obedience, rose on tiptoe, and\nstruck a pane with her fist. The glass broke and fell with a loud\nclatter.\n\n\"Good,\" said the father.\n\nHe was grave and abrupt. His glance swept rapidly over all the crannies\nof the garret. One would have said that he was a general making the\nfinal preparation at the moment when the battle is on the point of\nbeginning.\n\nThe mother, who had not said a word so far, now rose and demanded in\na dull, slow, languid voice, whence her words seemed to emerge in a\ncongealed state:--\n\n\"What do you mean to do, my dear?\"\n\n\"Get into bed,\" replied the man.\n\nHis intonation admitted of no deliberation. The mother obeyed, and threw\nherself heavily on one of the pallets.\n\nIn the meantime, a sob became audible in one corner.\n\n\"What's that?\" cried the father.\n\nThe younger daughter exhibited her bleeding fist, without quitting the\ncorner in which she was cowering. She had wounded herself while breaking\nthe window; she went off, near her mother's pallet and wept silently.\n\nIt was now the mother's turn to start up and exclaim:--\n\n\"Just see there! What follies you commit! She has cut herself breaking\nthat pane for you!\"\n\n\"So much the better!\" said the man. \"I foresaw that.\"\n\n\"What? So much the better?\" retorted his wife.\n\n\"Peace!\" replied the father, \"I suppress the liberty of the press.\"\n\nThen tearing the woman's chemise which he was wearing, he made a strip\nof cloth with which he hastily swathed the little girl's bleeding wrist.\n\nThat done, his eye fell with a satisfied expression on his torn chemise.\n\n\"And the chemise too,\" said he, \"this has a good appearance.\"\n\nAn icy breeze whistled through the window and entered the room. The\nouter mist penetrated thither and diffused itself like a whitish sheet\nof wadding vaguely spread by invisible fingers. Through the broken pane\nthe snow could be seen falling. The snow promised by the Candlemas sun\nof the preceding day had actually come.\n\nThe father cast a glance about him as though to make sure that he had\nforgotten nothing. He seized an old shovel and spread ashes over the wet\nbrands in such a manner as to entirely conceal them.\n\nThen drawing himself up and leaning against the chimney-piece:--\n\n\"Now,\" said he, \"we can receive the philanthropist.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII--THE RAY OF LIGHT IN THE HOVEL\n\nThe big girl approached and laid her hand in her father's.\n\n\"Feel how cold I am,\" said she.\n\n\"Bah!\" replied the father, \"I am much colder than that.\"\n\nThe mother exclaimed impetuously:--\n\n\"You always have something better than any one else, so you do! even bad\nthings.\"\n\n\"Down with you!\" said the man.\n\nThe mother, being eyed after a certain fashion, held her tongue.\n\nSilence reigned for a moment in the hovel. The elder girl was removing\nthe mud from the bottom of her mantle, with a careless air; her younger\nsister continued to sob; the mother had taken the latter's head between\nher hands, and was covering it with kisses, whispering to her the\nwhile:--\n\n\"My treasure, I entreat you, it is nothing of consequence, don't cry,\nyou will anger your father.\"\n\n\"No!\" exclaimed the father, \"quite the contrary! sob! sob! that's\nright.\"\n\nThen turning to the elder:--\n\n\"There now! He is not coming! What if he were not to come! I shall have\nextinguished my fire, wrecked my chair, torn my shirt, and broken my\npane all for nothing.\"\n\n\"And wounded the child!\" murmured the mother.\n\n\"Do you know,\" went on the father, \"that it's beastly cold in this\ndevil's garret! What if that man should not come! Oh! See there, you! He\nmakes us wait! He says to himself: 'Well! they will wait for me!\nThat's what they're there for.' Oh! how I hate them, and with what joy,\njubilation, enthusiasm, and satisfaction I could strangle all those rich\nfolks! all those rich folks! These men who pretend to be charitable,\nwho put on airs, who go to mass, who make presents to the priesthood,\npreachy, preachy, in their skullcaps, and who think themselves above\nus, and who come for the purpose of humiliating us, and to bring us\n'clothes,' as they say! old duds that are not worth four sous! And\nbread! That's not what I want, pack of rascals that they are, it's\nmoney! Ah! money! Never! Because they say that we would go off and drink\nit up, and that we are drunkards and idlers! And they! What are they,\nthen, and what have they been in their time! Thieves! They never could\nhave become rich otherwise! Oh! Society ought to be grasped by the four\ncorners of the cloth and tossed into the air, all of it! It would all\nbe smashed, very likely, but at least, no one would have anything,\nand there would be that much gained! But what is that blockhead of\na benevolent gentleman doing? Will he come? Perhaps the animal has\nforgotten the address! I'll bet that that old beast--\"\n\nAt that moment there came a light tap at the door, the man rushed to it\nand opened it, exclaiming, amid profound bows and smiles of adoration:--\n\n\"Enter, sir! Deign to enter, most respected benefactor, and your\ncharming young lady, also.\"\n\nA man of ripe age and a young girl made their appearance on the\nthreshold of the attic.\n\nMarius had not quitted his post. His feelings for the moment surpassed\nthe powers of the human tongue.\n\nIt was She!\n\nWhoever has loved knows all the radiant meanings contained in those\nthree letters of that word: She.\n\nIt was certainly she. Marius could hardly distinguish her through the\nluminous vapor which had suddenly spread before his eyes. It was that\nsweet, absent being, that star which had beamed upon him for six months;\nit was those eyes, that brow, that mouth, that lovely vanished face\nwhich had created night by its departure. The vision had been eclipsed,\nnow it reappeared.\n\nIt reappeared in that gloom, in that garret, in that misshapen attic, in\nall that horror.\n\nMarius shuddered in dismay. What! It was she! The palpitations of his\nheart troubled his sight. He felt that he was on the brink of bursting\ninto tears! What! He beheld her again at last, after having sought her\nso long! It seemed to him that he had lost his soul, and that he had\njust found it again.\n\nShe was the same as ever, only a little pale; her delicate face was\nframed in a bonnet of violet velvet, her figure was concealed beneath\na pelisse of black satin. Beneath her long dress, a glimpse could be\ncaught of her tiny foot shod in a silken boot.\n\nShe was still accompanied by M. Leblanc.\n\nShe had taken a few steps into the room, and had deposited a tolerably\nbulky parcel on the table.\n\nThe eldest Jondrette girl had retired behind the door, and was staring\nwith sombre eyes at that velvet bonnet, that silk mantle, and that\ncharming, happy face.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX--JONDRETTE COMES NEAR WEEPING\n\nThe hovel was so dark, that people coming from without felt on entering\nit the effect produced on entering a cellar. The two new-comers\nadvanced, therefore, with a certain hesitation, being hardly able\nto distinguish the vague forms surrounding them, while they could be\nclearly seen and scrutinized by the eyes of the inhabitants of the\ngarret, who were accustomed to this twilight.\n\nM. Leblanc approached, with his sad but kindly look, and said to\nJondrette the father:--\n\n\"Monsieur, in this package you will find some new clothes and some\nwoollen stockings and blankets.\"\n\n\"Our angelic benefactor overwhelms us,\" said Jondrette, bowing to the\nvery earth.\n\nThen, bending down to the ear of his eldest daughter, while the two\nvisitors were engaged in examining this lamentable interior, he added in\na low and rapid voice:--\n\n\"Hey? What did I say? Duds! No money! They are all alike! By the way,\nhow was the letter to that old blockhead signed?\"\n\n\"Fabantou,\" replied the girl.\n\n\"The dramatic artist, good!\"\n\nIt was lucky for Jondrette, that this had occurred to him, for at the\nvery moment, M. Leblanc turned to him, and said to him with the air of a\nperson who is seeking to recall a name:--\n\n\"I see that you are greatly to be pitied, Monsieur--\"\n\n\"Fabantou,\" replied Jondrette quickly.\n\n\"Monsieur Fabantou, yes, that is it. I remember.\"\n\n\"Dramatic artist, sir, and one who has had some success.\"\n\nHere Jondrette evidently judged the moment propitious for capturing the\n\"philanthropist.\" He exclaimed with an accent which smacked at the same\ntime of the vainglory of the mountebank at fairs, and the humility of\nthe mendicant on the highway:--\n\n\"A pupil of Talma! Sir! I am a pupil of Talma! Fortune formerly smiled\non me--Alas! Now it is misfortune's turn. You see, my benefactor, no\nbread, no fire. My poor babes have no fire! My only chair has no seat! A\nbroken pane! And in such weather! My spouse in bed! Ill!\"\n\n\"Poor woman!\" said M. Leblanc.\n\n\"My child wounded!\" added Jondrette.\n\nThe child, diverted by the arrival of the strangers, had fallen to\ncontemplating \"the young lady,\" and had ceased to sob.\n\n\"Cry! bawl!\" said Jondrette to her in a low voice.\n\nAt the same time he pinched her sore hand. All this was done with the\ntalent of a juggler.\n\nThe little girl gave vent to loud shrieks.\n\nThe adorable young girl, whom Marius, in his heart, called \"his Ursule,\"\napproached her hastily.\n\n\"Poor, dear child!\" said she.\n\n\"You see, my beautiful young lady,\" pursued Jondrette \"her bleeding\nwrist! It came through an accident while working at a machine to earn\nsix sous a day. It may be necessary to cut off her arm.\"\n\n\"Really?\" said the old gentleman, in alarm.\n\nThe little girl, taking this seriously, fell to sobbing more violently\nthan ever.\n\n\"Alas! yes, my benefactor!\" replied the father.\n\nFor several minutes, Jondrette had been scrutinizing \"the benefactor\"\nin a singular fashion. As he spoke, he seemed to be examining the other\nattentively, as though seeking to summon up his recollections. All at\nonce, profiting by a moment when the new-comers were questioning the\nchild with interest as to her injured hand, he passed near his wife,\nwho lay in her bed with a stupid and dejected air, and said to her in a\nrapid but very low tone:--\n\n\"Take a look at that man!\"\n\nThen, turning to M. Leblanc, and continuing his lamentations:--\n\n\"You see, sir! All the clothing that I have is my wife's chemise! And\nall torn at that! In the depths of winter! I can't go out for lack of a\ncoat. If I had a coat of any sort, I would go and see Mademoiselle Mars,\nwho knows me and is very fond of me. Does she not still reside in the\nRue de la Tour-des-Dames? Do you know, sir? We played together in the\nprovinces. I shared her laurels. Celimene would come to my succor, sir!\nElmire would bestow alms on Belisaire! But no, nothing! And not a sou in\nthe house! My wife ill, and not a sou! My daughter dangerously injured,\nnot a sou! My wife suffers from fits of suffocation. It comes from her\nage, and besides, her nervous system is affected. She ought to have\nassistance, and my daughter also! But the doctor! But the apothecary!\nHow am I to pay them? I would kneel to a penny, sir! Such is the\ncondition to which the arts are reduced. And do you know, my charming\nyoung lady, and you, my generous protector, do you know, you who breathe\nforth virtue and goodness, and who perfume that church where my daughter\nsees you every day when she says her prayers?--For I have brought up my\nchildren religiously, sir. I did not want them to take to the theatre.\nAh! the hussies! If I catch them tripping! I do not jest, that I don't!\nI read them lessons on honor, on morality, on virtue! Ask them! They\nhave got to walk straight. They are none of your unhappy wretches who\nbegin by having no family, and end by espousing the public. One is\nMamselle Nobody, and one becomes Madame Everybody. Deuce take it! None\nof that in the Fabantou family! I mean to bring them up virtuously, and\nthey shall be honest, and nice, and believe in God, by the sacred name!\nWell, sir, my worthy sir, do you know what is going to happen to-morrow?\nTo-morrow is the fourth day of February, the fatal day, the last day of\ngrace allowed me by my landlord; if by this evening I have not paid my\nrent, to-morrow my oldest daughter, my spouse with her fever, my child\nwith her wound,--we shall all four be turned out of here and thrown into\nthe street, on the boulevard, without shelter, in the rain, in the snow.\nThere, sir. I owe for four quarters--a whole year! that is to say, sixty\nfrancs.\"\n\nJondrette lied. Four quarters would have amounted to only forty francs,\nand he could not owe four, because six months had not elapsed since\nMarius had paid for two.\n\nM. Leblanc drew five francs from his pocket and threw them on the table.\n\nJondrette found time to mutter in the ear of his eldest daughter:--\n\n\"The scoundrel! What does he think I can do with his five francs?\nThat won't pay me for my chair and pane of glass! That's what comes of\nincurring expenses!\"\n\nIn the meanwhile, M. Leblanc had removed the large brown great-coat\nwhich he wore over his blue coat, and had thrown it over the back of the\nchair.\n\n\"Monsieur Fabantou,\" he said, \"these five francs are all that I have\nabout me, but I shall now take my daughter home, and I will return this\nevening,--it is this evening that you must pay, is it not?\"\n\nJondrette's face lighted up with a strange expression. He replied\nvivaciously:--\n\n\"Yes, respected sir. At eight o'clock, I must be at my landlord's.\"\n\n\"I will be here at six, and I will fetch you the sixty francs.\"\n\n\"My benefactor!\" exclaimed Jondrette, overwhelmed. And he added, in a\nlow tone: \"Take a good look at him, wife!\"\n\nM. Leblanc had taken the arm of the young girl, once more, and had\nturned towards the door.\n\n\"Farewell until this evening, my friends!\" said he.\n\n\"Six o'clock?\" said Jondrette.\n\n\"Six o'clock precisely.\"\n\nAt that moment, the overcoat lying on the chair caught the eye of the\nelder Jondrette girl.\n\n\"You are forgetting your coat, sir,\" said she.\n\nJondrette darted an annihilating look at his daughter, accompanied by a\nformidable shrug of the shoulders.\n\nM. Leblanc turned back and said, with a smile:--\n\n\"I have not forgotten it, I am leaving it.\"\n\n\"O my protector!\" said Jondrette, \"my august benefactor, I melt into\ntears! Permit me to accompany you to your carriage.\"\n\n\"If you come out,\" answered M. Leblanc, \"put on this coat. It really is\nvery cold.\"\n\nJondrette did not need to be told twice. He hastily donned the brown\ngreat-coat. And all three went out, Jondrette preceding the two\nstrangers.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X--TARIFF OF LICENSED CABS: TWO FRANCS AN HOUR\n\nMarius had lost nothing of this entire scene, and yet, in reality, had\nseen nothing. His eyes had remained fixed on the young girl, his heart\nhad, so to speak, seized her and wholly enveloped her from the moment of\nher very first step in that garret. During her entire stay there, he\nhad lived that life of ecstasy which suspends material perceptions and\nprecipitates the whole soul on a single point. He contemplated, not that\ngirl, but that light which wore a satin pelisse and a velvet bonnet. The\nstar Sirius might have entered the room, and he would not have been any\nmore dazzled.\n\nWhile the young girl was engaged in opening the package, unfolding the\nclothing and the blankets, questioning the sick mother kindly, and the\nlittle injured girl tenderly, he watched her every movement, he sought\nto catch her words. He knew her eyes, her brow, her beauty, her form,\nher walk, he did not know the sound of her voice. He had once fancied\nthat he had caught a few words at the Luxembourg, but he was not\nabsolutely sure of the fact. He would have given ten years of his life\nto hear it, in order that he might bear away in his soul a little of\nthat music. But everything was drowned in the lamentable exclamations\nand trumpet bursts of Jondrette. This added a touch of genuine wrath\nto Marius' ecstasy. He devoured her with his eyes. He could not believe\nthat it really was that divine creature whom he saw in the midst of\nthose vile creatures in that monstrous lair. It seemed to him that he\nbeheld a humming-bird in the midst of toads.\n\nWhen she took her departure, he had but one thought, to follow her, to\ncling to her trace, not to quit her until he learned where she\nlived, not to lose her again, at least, after having so miraculously\nre-discovered her. He leaped down from the commode and seized his hat.\nAs he laid his hand on the lock of the door, and was on the point of\nopening it, a sudden reflection caused him to pause. The corridor was\nlong, the staircase steep, Jondrette was talkative, M. Leblanc had,\nno doubt, not yet regained his carriage; if, on turning round in the\ncorridor, or on the staircase, he were to catch sight of him, Marius,\nin that house, he would, evidently, take the alarm, and find means to\nescape from him again, and this time it would be final. What was he\nto do? Should he wait a little? But while he was waiting, the carriage\nmight drive off. Marius was perplexed. At last he accepted the risk and\nquitted his room.\n\nThere was no one in the corridor. He hastened to the stairs. There was\nno one on the staircase. He descended in all haste, and reached the\nboulevard in time to see a fiacre turning the corner of the Rue du\nPetit-Banquier, on its way back to Paris.\n\nMarius rushed headlong in that direction. On arriving at the angle of\nthe boulevard, he caught sight of the fiacre again, rapidly descending\nthe Rue Mouffetard; the carriage was already a long way off, and there\nwas no means of overtaking it; what! run after it? Impossible; and\nbesides, the people in the carriage would assuredly notice an individual\nrunning at full speed in pursuit of a fiacre, and the father would\nrecognize him. At that moment, wonderful and unprecedented good luck,\nMarius perceived an empty cab passing along the boulevard. There was but\none thing to be done, to jump into this cab and follow the fiacre. That\nwas sure, efficacious, and free from danger.\n\nMarius made the driver a sign to halt, and called to him:--\n\n\"By the hour?\"\n\nMarius wore no cravat, he had on his working-coat, which was destitute\nof buttons, his shirt was torn along one of the plaits on the bosom.\n\nThe driver halted, winked, and held out his left hand to Marius, rubbing\nhis forefinger gently with his thumb.\n\n\"What is it?\" said Marius.\n\n\"Pay in advance,\" said the coachman.\n\nMarius recollected that he had but sixteen sous about him.\n\n\"How much?\" he demanded.\n\n\"Forty sous.\"\n\n\"I will pay on my return.\"\n\nThe driver's only reply was to whistle the air of La Palisse and to whip\nup his horse.\n\nMarius stared at the retreating cabriolet with a bewildered air. For the\nlack of four and twenty sous, he was losing his joy, his happiness,\nhis love! He had seen, and he was becoming blind again. He reflected\nbitterly, and it must be confessed, with profound regret, on the five\nfrancs which he had bestowed, that very morning, on that miserable girl.\nIf he had had those five francs, he would have been saved, he would have\nbeen born again, he would have emerged from the limbo and darkness, he\nwould have made his escape from isolation and spleen, from his widowed\nstate; he might have re-knotted the black thread of his destiny to that\nbeautiful golden thread, which had just floated before his eyes and\nhad broken at the same instant, once more! He returned to his hovel in\ndespair.\n\nHe might have told himself that M. Leblanc had promised to return in\nthe evening, and that all he had to do was to set about the matter more\nskilfully, so that he might follow him on that occasion; but, in his\ncontemplation, it is doubtful whether he had heard this.\n\nAs he was on the point of mounting the staircase, he perceived, on the\nother side of the boulevard, near the deserted wall skirting the Rue De\nla Barriere-des-Gobelins, Jondrette, wrapped in the \"philanthropist's\"\ngreat-coat, engaged in conversation with one of those men of disquieting\naspect who have been dubbed by common consent, prowlers of the barriers;\npeople of equivocal face, of suspicious monologues, who present the\nair of having evil minds, and who generally sleep in the daytime, which\nsuggests the supposition that they work by night.\n\nThese two men, standing there motionless and in conversation, in the\nsnow which was falling in whirlwinds, formed a group that a policeman\nwould surely have observed, but which Marius hardly noticed.\n\nStill, in spite of his mournful preoccupation, he could not refrain from\nsaying to himself that this prowler of the barriers with whom Jondrette\nwas talking resembled a certain Panchaud, alias Printanier, alias\nBigrenaille, whom Courfeyrac had once pointed out to him as a very\ndangerous nocturnal roamer. This man's name the reader has learned in\nthe preceding book. This Panchaud, alias Printanier, alias Bigrenaille,\nfigured later on in many criminal trials, and became a notorious rascal.\nHe was at that time only a famous rascal. To-day he exists in the state\nof tradition among ruffians and assassins. He was at the head of\na school towards the end of the last reign. And in the evening, at\nnightfall, at the hour when groups form and talk in whispers, he was\ndiscussed at La Force in the Fosse-aux-Lions. One might even, in\nthat prison, precisely at the spot where the sewer which served the\nunprecedented escape, in broad daylight, of thirty prisoners, in 1843,\npasses under the culvert, read his name, PANCHAUD, audaciously carved\nby his own hand on the wall of the sewer, during one of his attempts at\nflight. In 1832, the police already had their eye on him, but he had not\nas yet made a serious beginning.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI--OFFERS OF SERVICE FROM MISERY TO WRETCHEDNESS\n\nMarius ascended the stairs of the hovel with slow steps; at the moment\nwhen he was about to re-enter his cell, he caught sight of the elder\nJondrette girl following him through the corridor. The very sight of\nthis girl was odious to him; it was she who had his five francs, it was\ntoo late to demand them back, the cab was no longer there, the fiacre\nwas far away. Moreover, she would not have given them back. As for\nquestioning her about the residence of the persons who had just been\nthere, that was useless; it was evident that she did not know, since the\nletter signed Fabantou had been addressed \"to the benevolent gentleman\nof the church of Saint-Jacquesdu-Haut-Pas.\"\n\nMarius entered his room and pushed the door to after him.\n\nIt did not close; he turned round and beheld a hand which held the door\nhalf open.\n\n\"What is it?\" he asked, \"who is there?\"\n\nIt was the Jondrette girl.\n\n\"Is it you?\" resumed Marius almost harshly, \"still you! What do you want\nwith me?\"\n\nShe appeared to be thoughtful and did not look at him. She no longer had\nthe air of assurance which had characterized her that morning. She did\nnot enter, but held back in the darkness of the corridor, where Marius\ncould see her through the half-open door.\n\n\"Come now, will you answer?\" cried Marius. \"What do you want with me?\"\n\nShe raised her dull eyes, in which a sort of gleam seemed to flicker\nvaguely, and said:--\n\n\"Monsieur Marius, you look sad. What is the matter with you?\"\n\n\"With me!\" said Marius.\n\n\"Yes, you.\"\n\n\"There is nothing the matter with me.\"\n\n\"Yes, there is!\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"I tell you there is!\"\n\n\"Let me alone!\"\n\nMarius gave the door another push, but she retained her hold on it.\n\n\"Stop,\" said she, \"you are in the wrong. Although you are not rich, you\nwere kind this morning. Be so again now. You gave me something to eat,\nnow tell me what ails you. You are grieved, that is plain. I do not want\nyou to be grieved. What can be done for it? Can I be of any service?\nEmploy me. I do not ask for your secrets, you need not tell them to me,\nbut I may be of use, nevertheless. I may be able to help you, since I\nhelp my father. When it is necessary to carry letters, to go to houses,\nto inquire from door to door, to find out an address, to follow any one,\nI am of service. Well, you may assuredly tell me what is the matter with\nyou, and I will go and speak to the persons; sometimes it is enough if\nsome one speaks to the persons, that suffices to let them understand\nmatters, and everything comes right. Make use of me.\"\n\nAn idea flashed across Marius' mind. What branch does one disdain when\none feels that one is falling?\n\nHe drew near to the Jondrette girl.\n\n\"Listen--\" he said to her.\n\nShe interrupted him with a gleam of joy in her eyes.\n\n\"Oh yes, do call me thou! I like that better.\"\n\n\"Well,\" he resumed, \"thou hast brought hither that old gentleman and his\ndaughter!\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Dost thou know their address?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Find it for me.\"\n\nThe Jondrette's dull eyes had grown joyous, and they now became gloomy.\n\n\"Is that what you want?\" she demanded.\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Do you know them?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"That is to say,\" she resumed quickly, \"you do not know her, but you\nwish to know her.\"\n\nThis them which had turned into her had something indescribably\nsignificant and bitter about it.\n\n\"Well, can you do it?\" said Marius.\n\n\"You shall have the beautiful lady's address.\"\n\nThere was still a shade in the words \"the beautiful lady\" which troubled\nMarius. He resumed:--\n\n\"Never mind, after all, the address of the father and daughter. Their\naddress, indeed!\"\n\nShe gazed fixedly at him.\n\n\"What will you give me?\"\n\n\"Anything you like.\"\n\n\"Anything I like?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"You shall have the address.\"\n\nShe dropped her head; then, with a brusque movement, she pulled to the\ndoor, which closed behind her.\n\nMarius found himself alone.\n\nHe dropped into a chair, with his head and both elbows on his bed,\nabsorbed in thoughts which he could not grasp, and as though a prey to\nvertigo. All that had taken place since the morning, the appearance of\nthe angel, her disappearance, what that creature had just said to him, a\ngleam of hope floating in an immense despair,--this was what filled his\nbrain confusedly.\n\nAll at once he was violently aroused from his revery.\n\nHe heard the shrill, hard voice of Jondrette utter these words, which\nwere fraught with a strange interest for him:--\n\n\"I tell you that I am sure of it, and that I recognized him.\"\n\nOf whom was Jondrette speaking? Whom had he recognized? M. Leblanc? The\nfather of \"his Ursule\"? What! Did Jondrette know him? Was Marius about\nto obtain in this abrupt and unexpected fashion all the information\nwithout which his life was so dark to him? Was he about to learn at last\nwho it was that he loved, who that young girl was? Who her father\nwas? Was the dense shadow which enwrapped them on the point of being\ndispelled? Was the veil about to be rent? Ah! Heavens!\n\nHe bounded rather than climbed upon his commode, and resumed his post\nnear the little peep-hole in the partition wall.\n\nAgain he beheld the interior of Jondrette's hovel.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII--THE USE MADE OF M. LEBLANC'S FIVE-FRANC PIECE\n\nNothing in the aspect of the family was altered, except that the wife\nand daughters had levied on the package and put on woollen stockings and\njackets. Two new blankets were thrown across the two beds.\n\nJondrette had evidently just returned. He still had the breathlessness\nof out of doors. His daughters were seated on the floor near the\nfireplace, the elder engaged in dressing the younger's wounded hand. His\nwife had sunk back on the bed near the fireplace, with a face indicative\nof astonishment. Jondrette was pacing up and down the garret with long\nstrides. His eyes were extraordinary.\n\nThe woman, who seemed timid and overwhelmed with stupor in the presence\nof her husband, turned to say:--\n\n\"What, really? You are sure?\"\n\n\"Sure! Eight years have passed! But I recognize him! Ah! I recognize\nhim. I knew him at once! What! Didn't it force itself on you?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"But I told you: 'Pay attention!' Why, it is his figure, it is his face,\nonly older,--there are people who do not grow old, I don't know how they\nmanage it,--it is the very sound of his voice. He is better dressed,\nthat is all! Ah! you mysterious old devil, I've got you, that I have!\"\n\nHe paused, and said to his daughters:--\n\n\"Get out of here, you!--It's queer that it didn't strike you!\"\n\nThey arose to obey.\n\nThe mother stammered:--\n\n\"With her injured hand.\"\n\n\"The air will do it good,\" said Jondrette. \"Be off.\"\n\nIt was plain that this man was of the sort to whom no one offers to\nreply. The two girls departed.\n\nAt the moment when they were about to pass through the door, the father\ndetained the elder by the arm, and said to her with a peculiar accent:--\n\n\"You will be here at five o'clock precisely. Both of you. I shall need\nyou.\"\n\nMarius redoubled his attention.\n\nOn being left alone with his wife, Jondrette began to pace the room\nagain, and made the tour of it two or three times in silence. Then he\nspent several minutes in tucking the lower part of the woman's chemise\nwhich he wore into his trousers.\n\nAll at once, he turned to the female Jondrette, folded his arms and\nexclaimed:--\n\n\"And would you like to have me tell you something? The young lady--\"\n\n\"Well, what?\" retorted his wife, \"the young lady?\"\n\nMarius could not doubt that it was really she of whom they were\nspeaking. He listened with ardent anxiety. His whole life was in his\nears.\n\nBut Jondrette had bent over and spoke to his wife in a whisper. Then he\nstraightened himself up and concluded aloud:--\n\n\"It is she!\"\n\n\"That one?\" said his wife.\n\n\"That very one,\" said the husband.\n\nNo expression can reproduce the significance of the mother's words.\nSurprise, rage, hate, wrath, were mingled and combined in one monstrous\nintonation. The pronunciation of a few words, the name, no doubt, which\nher husband had whispered in her ear, had sufficed to rouse this huge,\nsomnolent woman, and from being repulsive she became terrible.\n\n\"It is not possible!\" she cried. \"When I think that my daughters are\ngoing barefoot, and have not a gown to their backs! What! A satin\npelisse, a velvet bonnet, boots, and everything; more than two hundred\nfrancs' worth of clothes! so that one would think she was a lady! No,\nyou are mistaken! Why, in the first place, the other was hideous, and\nthis one is not so bad-looking! She really is not bad-looking! It can't\nbe she!\"\n\n\"I tell you that it is she. You will see.\"\n\nAt this absolute assertion, the Jondrette woman raised her large, red,\nblonde face and stared at the ceiling with a horrible expression.\nAt that moment, she seemed to Marius even more to be feared than her\nhusband. She was a sow with the look of a tigress.\n\n\"What!\" she resumed, \"that horrible, beautiful young lady, who gazed at\nmy daughters with an air of pity,--she is that beggar brat! Oh! I should\nlike to kick her stomach in for her!\"\n\nShe sprang off of the bed, and remained standing for a moment, her\nhair in disorder, her nostrils dilating, her mouth half open, her fists\nclenched and drawn back. Then she fell back on the bed once more. The\nman paced to and fro and paid no attention to his female.\n\nAfter a silence lasting several minutes, he approached the female\nJondrette, and halted in front of her, with folded arms, as he had done\na moment before:--\n\n\"And shall I tell you another thing?\"\n\n\"What is it?\" she asked.\n\nHe answered in a low, curt voice:--\n\n\"My fortune is made.\"\n\nThe woman stared at him with the look that signifies: \"Is the person who\nis addressing me on the point of going mad?\"\n\nHe went on:--\n\n\"Thunder! It was not so very long ago that I was a parishioner of\nthe parish of\ndie-of-hunger-if-you-have-a-fire,-die-of-cold-if-you-have-bread! I have\nhad enough of misery! my share and other people's share! I am not joking\nany longer, I don't find it comic any more, I've had enough of puns,\ngood God! no more farces, Eternal Father! I want to eat till I am full,\nI want to drink my fill! to gormandize! to sleep! to do nothing! I want\nto have my turn, so I do, come now! before I die! I want to be a bit of\na millionnaire!\"\n\nHe took a turn round the hovel, and added:--\n\n\"Like other people.\"\n\n\"What do you mean by that?\" asked the woman.\n\nHe shook his head, winked, screwed up one eye, and raised his voice like\na medical professor who is about to make a demonstration:--\n\n\"What do I mean by that? Listen!\"\n\n\"Hush!\" muttered the woman, \"not so loud! These are matters which must\nnot be overheard.\"\n\n\"Bah! Who's here? Our neighbor? I saw him go out a little while ago.\nBesides, he doesn't listen, the big booby. And I tell you that I saw him\ngo out.\"\n\nNevertheless, by a sort of instinct, Jondrette lowered his voice,\nalthough not sufficiently to prevent Marius hearing his words. One\nfavorable circumstance, which enabled Marius not to lose a word of this\nconversation was the falling snow which deadened the sound of vehicles\non the boulevard.\n\nThis is what Marius heard:--\n\n\"Listen carefully. The Croesus is caught, or as good as caught! That's\nall settled already. Everything is arranged. I have seen some people. He\nwill come here this evening at six o'clock. To bring sixty francs, the\nrascal! Did you notice how I played that game on him, my sixty francs,\nmy landlord, my fourth of February? I don't even owe for one quarter!\nIsn't he a fool! So he will come at six o'clock! That's the hour when\nour neighbor goes to his dinner. Mother Bougon is off washing dishes in\nthe city. There's not a soul in the house. The neighbor never comes home\nuntil eleven o'clock. The children shall stand on watch. You shall help\nus. He will give in.\"\n\n\"And what if he does not give in?\" demanded his wife.\n\nJondrette made a sinister gesture, and said:--\n\n\"We'll fix him.\"\n\nAnd he burst out laughing.\n\nThis was the first time Marius had seen him laugh. The laugh was cold\nand sweet, and provoked a shudder.\n\nJondrette opened a cupboard near the fireplace, and drew from it an old\ncap, which he placed on his head, after brushing it with his sleeve.\n\n\"Now,\" said he, \"I'm going out. I have some more people that I must see.\nGood ones. You'll see how well the whole thing will work. I shall be\naway as short a time as possible, it's a fine stroke of business, do you\nlook after the house.\"\n\nAnd with both fists thrust into the pockets of his trousers, he stood\nfor a moment in thought, then exclaimed:--\n\n\"Do you know, it's mighty lucky, by the way, that he didn't recognize\nme! If he had recognized me on his side, he would not have come back\nagain. He would have slipped through our fingers! It was my beard that\nsaved us! my romantic beard! my pretty little romantic beard!\"\n\nAnd again he broke into a laugh.\n\nHe stepped to the window. The snow was still falling, and streaking the\ngray of the sky.\n\n\"What beastly weather!\" said he.\n\nThen lapping his overcoat across his breast:--\n\n\"This rind is too large for me. Never mind,\" he added, \"he did a\ndevilish good thing in leaving it for me, the old scoundrel! If it\nhadn't been for that, I couldn't have gone out, and everything would\nhave gone wrong! What small points things hang on, anyway!\"\n\nAnd pulling his cap down over his eyes, he quitted the room.\n\nHe had barely had time to take half a dozen steps from the door, when\nthe door opened again, and his savage but intelligent face made its\nappearance once more in the opening.\n\n\"I came near forgetting,\" said he. \"You are to have a brazier of\ncharcoal ready.\"\n\nAnd he flung into his wife's apron the five-franc piece which the\n\"philanthropist\" had left with him.\n\n\"A brazier of charcoal?\" asked his wife.\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"How many bushels?\"\n\n\"Two good ones.\"\n\n\"That will come to thirty sous. With the rest I will buy something for\ndinner.\"\n\n\"The devil, no.\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"Don't go and spend the hundred-sou piece.\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"Because I shall have to buy something, too.\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"Something.\"\n\n\"How much shall you need?\"\n\n\"Whereabouts in the neighborhood is there an ironmonger's shop?\"\n\n\"Rue Mouffetard.\"\n\n\"Ah! yes, at the corner of a street; I can see the shop.\"\n\n\"But tell me how much you will need for what you have to purchase?\"\n\n\"Fifty sous--three francs.\"\n\n\"There won't be much left for dinner.\"\n\n\"Eating is not the point to-day. There's something better to be done.\"\n\n\"That's enough, my jewel.\"\n\nAt this word from his wife, Jondrette closed the door again, and this\ntime, Marius heard his step die away in the corridor of the hovel, and\ndescend the staircase rapidly.\n\nAt that moment, one o'clock struck from the church of Saint-Medard.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII--SOLUS CUM SOLO, IN LOCO REMOTO, NON COGITABUNTUR ORARE\nPATER NOSTER\n\nMarius, dreamer as he was, was, as we have said, firm and energetic by\nnature. His habits of solitary meditation, while they had developed in\nhim sympathy and compassion, had, perhaps, diminished the faculty for\nirritation, but had left intact the power of waxing indignant; he had\nthe kindliness of a brahmin, and the severity of a judge; he took pity\nupon a toad, but he crushed a viper. Now, it was into a hole of vipers\nthat his glance had just been directed, it was a nest of monsters that\nhe had beneath his eyes.\n\n\"These wretches must be stamped upon,\" said he.\n\nNot one of the enigmas which he had hoped to see solved had been\nelucidated; on the contrary, all of them had been rendered more dense,\nif anything; he knew nothing more about the beautiful maiden of the\nLuxembourg and the man whom he called M. Leblanc, except that Jondrette\nwas acquainted with them. Athwart the mysterious words which had been\nuttered, the only thing of which he caught a distinct glimpse was the\nfact that an ambush was in course of preparation, a dark but terrible\ntrap; that both of them were incurring great danger, she probably, her\nfather certainly; that they must be saved; that the hideous plots of the\nJondrettes must be thwarted, and the web of these spiders broken.\n\nHe scanned the female Jondrette for a moment. She had pulled an old\nsheet-iron stove from a corner, and she was rummaging among the old heap\nof iron.\n\nHe descended from the commode as softly as possible, taking care not to\nmake the least noise. Amid his terror as to what was in preparation, and\nin the horror with which the Jondrettes had inspired him, he experienced\na sort of joy at the idea that it might be granted to him perhaps to\nrender a service to the one whom he loved.\n\nBut how was it to be done? How warn the persons threatened? He did not\nknow their address. They had reappeared for an instant before his eyes,\nand had then plunged back again into the immense depths of Paris. Should\nhe wait for M. Leblanc at the door that evening at six o'clock, at the\nmoment of his arrival, and warn him of the trap? But Jondrette and his\nmen would see him on the watch, the spot was lonely, they were stronger\nthan he, they would devise means to seize him or to get him away, and\nthe man whom Marius was anxious to save would be lost. One o'clock had\njust struck, the trap was to be sprung at six. Marius had five hours\nbefore him.\n\nThere was but one thing to be done.\n\nHe put on his decent coat, knotted a silk handkerchief round his neck,\ntook his hat, and went out, without making any more noise than if he had\nbeen treading on moss with bare feet.\n\nMoreover, the Jondrette woman continued to rummage among her old iron.\n\nOnce outside of the house, he made for the Rue du Petit-Banquier.\n\nHe had almost reached the middle of this street, near a very low wall\nwhich a man can easily step over at certain points, and which abuts on\na waste space, and was walking slowly, in consequence of his preoccupied\ncondition, and the snow deadened the sound of his steps; all at once he\nheard voices talking very close by. He turned his head, the street was\ndeserted, there was not a soul in it, it was broad daylight, and yet he\ndistinctly heard voices.\n\nIt occurred to him to glance over the wall which he was skirting.\n\nThere, in fact, sat two men, flat on the snow, with their backs against\nthe wall, talking together in subdued tones.\n\nThese two persons were strangers to him; one was a bearded man in a\nblouse, and the other a long-haired individual in rags. The bearded man\nhad on a fez, the other's head was bare, and the snow had lodged in his\nhair.\n\nBy thrusting his head over the wall, Marius could hear their remarks.\n\nThe hairy one jogged the other man's elbow and said:--\n\n\"--With the assistance of Patron-Minette, it can't fail.\"\n\n\"Do you think so?\" said the bearded man.\n\nAnd the long-haired one began again:--\n\n\"It's as good as a warrant for each one, of five hundred balls, and the\nworst that can happen is five years, six years, ten years at the most!\"\n\nThe other replied with some hesitation, and shivering beneath his fez:--\n\n\"That's a real thing. You can't go against such things.\"\n\n\"I tell you that the affair can't go wrong,\" resumed the long-haired\nman. \"Father What's-his-name's team will be already harnessed.\"\n\nThen they began to discuss a melodrama that they had seen on the\npreceding evening at the Gaite Theatre.\n\nMarius went his way.\n\nIt seemed to him that the mysterious words of these men, so strangely\nhidden behind that wall, and crouching in the snow, could not but bear\nsome relation to Jondrette's abominable projects. That must be the\naffair.\n\nHe directed his course towards the faubourg Saint-Marceau and asked at\nthe first shop he came to where he could find a commissary of police.\n\nHe was directed to Rue de Pontoise, No. 14.\n\nThither Marius betook himself.\n\nAs he passed a baker's shop, he bought a two-penny roll, and ate it,\nforeseeing that he should not dine.\n\nOn the way, he rendered justice to Providence. He reflected that had he\nnot given his five francs to the Jondrette girl in the morning, he\nwould have followed M. Leblanc's fiacre, and consequently have remained\nignorant of everything, and that there would have been no obstacle to\nthe trap of the Jondrettes and that M. Leblanc would have been lost, and\nhis daughter with him, no doubt.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV--IN WHICH A POLICE AGENT BESTOWS TWO FISTFULS ON A LAWYER\n\nOn arriving at No. 14, Rue de Pontoise, he ascended to the first floor\nand inquired for the commissary of police.\n\n\"The commissary of police is not here,\" said a clerk; \"but there is an\ninspector who takes his place. Would you like to speak to him? Are you\nin haste?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Marius.\n\nThe clerk introduced him into the commissary's office. There stood a\ntall man behind a grating, leaning against a stove, and holding up with\nboth hands the tails of a vast topcoat, with three collars. His face\nwas square, with a thin, firm mouth, thick, gray, and very ferocious\nwhiskers, and a look that was enough to turn your pockets inside out.\nOf that glance it might have been well said, not that it penetrated, but\nthat it searched.\n\nThis man's air was not much less ferocious nor less terrible than\nJondrette's; the dog is, at times, no less terrible to meet than the\nwolf.\n\n\"What do you want?\" he said to Marius, without adding \"monsieur.\"\n\n\"Is this Monsieur le Commissaire de Police?\"\n\n\"He is absent. I am here in his stead.\"\n\n\"The matter is very private.\"\n\n\"Then speak.\"\n\n\"And great haste is required.\"\n\n\"Then speak quick.\"\n\nThis calm, abrupt man was both terrifying and reassuring at one and the\nsame time. He inspired fear and confidence. Marius related the adventure\nto him: That a person with whom he was not acquainted otherwise than by\nsight, was to be inveigled into a trap that very evening; that, as he\noccupied the room adjoining the den, he, Marius Pontmercy, a lawyer,\nhad heard the whole plot through the partition; that the wretch who\nhad planned the trap was a certain Jondrette; that there would be\naccomplices, probably some prowlers of the barriers, among others a\ncertain Panchaud, alias Printanier, alias Bigrenaille; that Jondrette's\ndaughters were to lie in wait; that there was no way of warning the\nthreatened man, since he did not even know his name; and that, finally,\nall this was to be carried out at six o'clock that evening, at the most\ndeserted point of the Boulevard de l'Hopital, in house No. 50-52.\n\nAt the sound of this number, the inspector raised his head, and said\ncoldly:--\n\n\"So it is in the room at the end of the corridor?\"\n\n\"Precisely,\" answered Marius, and he added: \"Are you acquainted with\nthat house?\"\n\nThe inspector remained silent for a moment, then replied, as he warmed\nthe heel of his boot at the door of the stove:--\n\n\"Apparently.\"\n\nHe went on, muttering between his teeth, and not addressing Marius so\nmuch as his cravat:--\n\n\"Patron-Minette must have had a hand in this.\"\n\nThis word struck Marius.\n\n\"Patron-Minette,\" said he, \"I did hear that word pronounced, in fact.\"\n\nAnd he repeated to the inspector the dialogue between the long-haired\nman and the bearded man in the snow behind the wall of the Rue du\nPetit-Banquier.\n\nThe inspector muttered:--\n\n\"The long-haired man must be Brujon, and the bearded one Demi-Liard,\nalias Deux-Milliards.\"\n\nHe had dropped his eyelids again, and became absorbed in thought.\n\n\"As for Father What's-his-name, I think I recognize him. Here, I've\nburned my coat. They always have too much fire in these cursed stoves.\nNumber 50-52. Former property of Gorbeau.\"\n\nThen he glanced at Marius.\n\n\"You saw only that bearded and that long-haired man?\"\n\n\"And Panchaud.\"\n\n\"You didn't see a little imp of a dandy prowling about the premises?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Nor a big lump of matter, resembling an elephant in the Jardin des\nPlantes?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Nor a scamp with the air of an old red tail?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"As for the fourth, no one sees him, not even his adjutants, clerks, and\nemployees. It is not surprising that you did not see him.\"\n\n\"No. Who are all those persons?\" asked Marius.\n\nThe inspector answered:--\n\n\"Besides, this is not the time for them.\"\n\nHe relapsed into silence, then resumed:--\n\n\"50-52. I know that barrack. Impossible to conceal ourselves inside\nit without the artists seeing us, and then they will get off simply\nby countermanding the vaudeville. They are so modest! An audience\nembarrasses them. None of that, none of that. I want to hear them sing\nand make them dance.\"\n\nThis monologue concluded, he turned to Marius, and demanded, gazing at\nhim intently the while:--\n\n\"Are you afraid?\"\n\n\"Of what?\" said Marius.\n\n\"Of these men?\"\n\n\"No more than yourself!\" retorted Marius rudely, who had begun to notice\nthat this police agent had not yet said \"monsieur\" to him.\n\nThe inspector stared still more intently at Marius, and continued with\nsententious solemnity:--\n\n\"There, you speak like a brave man, and like an honest man. Courage does\nnot fear crime, and honesty does not fear authority.\"\n\nMarius interrupted him:--\n\n\"That is well, but what do you intend to do?\"\n\nThe inspector contented himself with the remark:--\n\n\"The lodgers have pass-keys with which to get in at night. You must have\none.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Marius.\n\n\"Have you it about you?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Give it to me,\" said the inspector.\n\nMarius took his key from his waistcoat pocket, handed it to the\ninspector and added:--\n\n\"If you will take my advice, you will come in force.\"\n\nThe inspector cast on Marius such a glance as Voltaire might have\nbestowed on a provincial academician who had suggested a rhyme to him;\nwith one movement he plunged his hands, which were enormous, into the\ntwo immense pockets of his top-coat, and pulled out two small steel\npistols, of the sort called \"knock-me-downs.\" Then he presented them to\nMarius, saying rapidly, in a curt tone:--\n\n\"Take these. Go home. Hide in your chamber, so that you may be supposed\nto have gone out. They are loaded. Each one carries two balls. You will\nkeep watch; there is a hole in the wall, as you have informed me. These\nmen will come. Leave them to their own devices for a time. When you\nthink matters have reached a crisis, and that it is time to put a stop\nto them, fire a shot. Not too soon. The rest concerns me. A shot into\nthe ceiling, the air, no matter where. Above all things, not too soon.\nWait until they begin to put their project into execution; you are a\nlawyer; you know the proper point.\" Marius took the pistols and put them\nin the side pocket of his coat.\n\n\"That makes a lump that can be seen,\" said the inspector. \"Put them in\nyour trousers pocket.\"\n\nMarius hid the pistols in his trousers pockets.\n\n\"Now,\" pursued the inspector, \"there is not a minute more to be lost by\nany one. What time is it? Half-past two. Seven o'clock is the hour?\"\n\n\"Six o'clock,\" answered Marius.\n\n\"I have plenty of time,\" said the inspector, \"but no more than enough.\nDon't forget anything that I have said to you. Bang. A pistol shot.\"\n\n\"Rest easy,\" said Marius.\n\nAnd as Marius laid his hand on the handle of the door on his way out,\nthe inspector called to him:--\n\n\"By the way, if you have occasion for my services between now and then,\ncome or send here. You will ask for Inspector Javert.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XV--JONDRETTE MAKES HIS PURCHASES\n\nA few moments later, about three o'clock, Courfeyrac chanced to be\npassing along the Rue Mouffetard in company with Bossuet. The snow had\nredoubled in violence, and filled the air. Bossuet was just saying to\nCourfeyrac:--\n\n\"One would say, to see all these snow-flakes fall, that there was a\nplague of white butterflies in heaven.\" All at once, Bossuet caught\nsight of Marius coming up the street towards the barrier with a peculiar\nair.\n\n\"Hold!\" said Bossuet. \"There's Marius.\"\n\n\"I saw him,\" said Courfeyrac. \"Don't let's speak to him.\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"He is busy.\"\n\n\"With what?\"\n\n\"Don't you see his air?\"\n\n\"What air?\"\n\n\"He has the air of a man who is following some one.\"\n\n\"That's true,\" said Bossuet.\n\n\"Just see the eyes he is making!\" said Courfeyrac.\n\n\"But who the deuce is he following?\"\n\n\"Some fine, flowery bonneted wench! He's in love.\"\n\n\"But,\" observed Bossuet, \"I don't see any wench nor any flowery bonnet\nin the street. There's not a woman round.\"\n\nCourfeyrac took a survey, and exclaimed:--\n\n\"He's following a man!\"\n\nA man, in fact, wearing a gray cap, and whose gray beard could be\ndistinguished, although they only saw his back, was walking along about\ntwenty paces in advance of Marius.\n\nThis man was dressed in a great-coat which was perfectly new and too\nlarge for him, and in a frightful pair of trousers all hanging in rags\nand black with mud.\n\nBossuet burst out laughing.\n\n\"Who is that man?\"\n\n\"He?\" retorted Courfeyrac, \"he's a poet. Poets are very fond of wearing\nthe trousers of dealers in rabbit skins and the overcoats of peers of\nFrance.\"\n\n\"Let's see where Marius will go,\" said Bossuet; \"let's see where the man\nis going, let's follow them, hey?\"\n\n\"Bossuet!\" exclaimed Courfeyrac, \"eagle of Meaux! You are a prodigious\nbrute. Follow a man who is following another man, indeed!\"\n\nThey retraced their steps.\n\nMarius had, in fact, seen Jondrette passing along the Rue Mouffetard,\nand was spying on his proceedings.\n\nJondrette walked straight ahead, without a suspicion that he was already\nheld by a glance.\n\nHe quitted the Rue Mouffetard, and Marius saw him enter one of the most\nterrible hovels in the Rue Gracieuse; he remained there about a quarter\nof an hour, then returned to the Rue Mouffetard. He halted at\nan ironmonger's shop, which then stood at the corner of the Rue\nPierre-Lombard, and a few minutes later Marius saw him emerge from the\nshop, holding in his hand a huge cold chisel with a white wood handle,\nwhich he concealed beneath his great-coat. At the top of the Rue\nPetit-Gentilly he turned to the left and proceeded rapidly to the Rue du\nPetit-Banquier. The day was declining; the snow, which had ceased for a\nmoment, had just begun again. Marius posted himself on the watch at the\nvery corner of the Rue du Petit-Banquier, which was deserted, as usual,\nand did not follow Jondrette into it. It was lucky that he did so,\nfor, on arriving in the vicinity of the wall where Marius had heard the\nlong-haired man and the bearded man conversing, Jondrette turned round,\nmade sure that no one was following him, did not see him, then sprang\nacross the wall and disappeared.\n\nThe waste land bordered by this wall communicated with the back yard of\nan ex-livery stable-keeper of bad repute, who had failed and who still\nkept a few old single-seated berlins under his sheds.\n\nMarius thought that it would be wise to profit by Jondrette's absence to\nreturn home; moreover, it was growing late; every evening, Ma'am Bougon\nwhen she set out for her dish-washing in town, had a habit of locking\nthe door, which was always closed at dusk. Marius had given his key to\nthe inspector of police; it was important, therefore, that he should\nmake haste.\n\nEvening had arrived, night had almost closed in; on the horizon and in\nthe immensity of space, there remained but one spot illuminated by the\nsun, and that was the moon.\n\nIt was rising in a ruddy glow behind the low dome of Salpetriere.\n\nMarius returned to No. 50-52 with great strides. The door was still open\nwhen he arrived. He mounted the stairs on tip-toe and glided along the\nwall of the corridor to his chamber. This corridor, as the reader will\nremember, was bordered on both sides by attics, all of which were, for\nthe moment, empty and to let. Ma'am Bougon was in the habit of leaving\nall the doors open. As he passed one of these attics, Marius thought\nhe perceived in the uninhabited cell the motionless heads of four men,\nvaguely lighted up by a remnant of daylight, falling through a dormer\nwindow.\n\nMarius made no attempt to see, not wishing to be seen himself. He\nsucceeded in reaching his chamber without being seen and without making\nany noise. It was high time. A moment later he heard Ma'am Bougon take\nher departure, locking the door of the house behind her.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI--IN WHICH WILL BE FOUND THE WORDS TO AN ENGLISH AIR WHICH\nWAS IN FASHION IN 1832\n\nMarius seated himself on his bed. It might have been half-past five\no'clock. Only half an hour separated him from what was about to happen.\nHe heard the beating of his arteries as one hears the ticking of a watch\nin the dark. He thought of the double march which was going on at that\nmoment in the dark,--crime advancing on one side, justice coming up on\nthe other. He was not afraid, but he could not think without a shudder\nof what was about to take place. As is the case with all those who are\nsuddenly assailed by an unforeseen adventure, the entire day produced\nupon him the effect of a dream, and in order to persuade himself that he\nwas not the prey of a nightmare, he had to feel the cold barrels of the\nsteel pistols in his trousers pockets.\n\nIt was no longer snowing; the moon disengaged itself more and more\nclearly from the mist, and its light, mingled with the white reflection\nof the snow which had fallen, communicated to the chamber a sort of\ntwilight aspect.\n\nThere was a light in the Jondrette den. Marius saw the hole in the wall\nshining with a reddish glow which seemed bloody to him.\n\nIt was true that the light could not be produced by a candle. However,\nthere was not a sound in the Jondrette quarters, not a soul was moving\nthere, not a soul speaking, not a breath; the silence was glacial and\nprofound, and had it not been for that light, he might have thought\nhimself next door to a sepulchre.\n\nMarius softly removed his boots and pushed them under his bed.\n\nSeveral minutes elapsed. Marius heard the lower door turn on its hinges;\na heavy step mounted the staircase, and hastened along the corridor; the\nlatch of the hovel was noisily lifted; it was Jondrette returning.\n\nInstantly, several voices arose. The whole family was in the garret.\nOnly, it had been silent in the master's absence, like wolf whelps in\nthe absence of the wolf.\n\n\"It's I,\" said he.\n\n\"Good evening, daddy,\" yelped the girls.\n\n\"Well?\" said the mother.\n\n\"All's going first-rate,\" responded Jondrette, \"but my feet are beastly\ncold. Good! You have dressed up. You have done well! You must inspire\nconfidence.\"\n\n\"All ready to go out.\"\n\n\"Don't forget what I told you. You will do everything sure?\"\n\n\"Rest easy.\"\n\n\"Because--\" said Jondrette. And he left the phrase unfinished.\n\nMarius heard him lay something heavy on the table, probably the chisel\nwhich he had purchased.\n\n\"By the way,\" said Jondrette, \"have you been eating here?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said the mother. \"I got three large potatoes and some salt. I\ntook advantage of the fire to cook them.\"\n\n\"Good,\" returned Jondrette. \"To-morrow I will take you out to dine with\nme. We will have a duck and fixings. You shall dine like Charles the\nTenth; all is going well!\"\n\nThen he added:--\n\n\"The mouse-trap is open. The cats are there.\"\n\nHe lowered his voice still further, and said:--\n\n\"Put this in the fire.\"\n\nMarius heard a sound of charcoal being knocked with the tongs or some\niron utensil, and Jondrette continued:--\n\n\"Have you greased the hinges of the door so that they will not squeak?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" replied the mother.\n\n\"What time is it?\"\n\n\"Nearly six. The half-hour struck from Saint-Medard a while ago.\"\n\n\"The devil!\" ejaculated Jondrette; \"the children must go and watch. Come\nyou, do you listen here.\"\n\nA whispering ensued.\n\nJondrette's voice became audible again:--\n\n\"Has old Bougon left?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said the mother.\n\n\"Are you sure that there is no one in our neighbor's room?\"\n\n\"He has not been in all day, and you know very well that this is his\ndinner hour.\"\n\n\"You are sure?\"\n\n\"Sure.\"\n\n\"All the same,\" said Jondrette, \"there's no harm in going to see whether\nhe is there. Here, my girl, take the candle and go there.\"\n\nMarius fell on his hands and knees and crawled silently under his bed.\n\nHardly had he concealed himself, when he perceived a light through the\ncrack of his door.\n\n\"P'pa,\" cried a voice, \"he is not in here.\"\n\nHe recognized the voice of the eldest daughter.\n\n\"Did you go in?\" demanded her father.\n\n\"No,\" replied the girl, \"but as his key is in the door, he must be out.\"\n\nThe father exclaimed:--\n\n\"Go in, nevertheless.\"\n\nThe door opened, and Marius saw the tall Jondrette come in with a candle\nin her hand. She was as she had been in the morning, only still more\nrepulsive in this light.\n\nShe walked straight up to the bed. Marius endured an indescribable\nmoment of anxiety; but near the bed there was a mirror nailed to the\nwall, and it was thither that she was directing her steps. She raised\nherself on tiptoe and looked at herself in it. In the neighboring room,\nthe sound of iron articles being moved was audible.\n\nShe smoothed her hair with the palm of her hand, and smiled into the\nmirror, humming with her cracked and sepulchral voice:--\n\n          Nos amours ont dure toute une semaine,[28]\n          Mais que du bonheur les instants sont courts!\n          S'adorer huit jours, c' etait bien la peine!\n          Le temps des amours devait durer toujours!\n          Devrait durer toujours! devrait durer toujours!\n\n\nIn the meantime, Marius trembled. It seemed impossible to him that she\nshould not hear his breathing.\n\nShe stepped to the window and looked out with the half-foolish way she\nhad.\n\n\"How ugly Paris is when it has put on a white chemise!\" said she.\n\nShe returned to the mirror and began again to put on airs before it,\nscrutinizing herself full-face and three-quarters face in turn.\n\n\"Well!\" cried her father, \"what are you about there?\"\n\n\"I am looking under the bed and the furniture,\" she replied, continuing\nto arrange her hair; \"there's no one here.\"\n\n\"Booby!\" yelled her father. \"Come here this minute! And don't waste any\ntime about it!\"\n\n\"Coming! Coming!\" said she. \"One has no time for anything in this\nhovel!\"\n\nShe hummed:--\n\n          Vous me quittez pour aller a la gloire;[29]\n          Mon triste coeur suivra partout.\n\n\nShe cast a parting glance in the mirror and went out, shutting the door\nbehind her.\n\nA moment more, and Marius heard the sound of the two young girls' bare\nfeet in the corridor, and Jondrette's voice shouting to them:--\n\n\"Pay strict heed! One on the side of the barrier, the other at the\ncorner of the Rue du Petit-Banquier. Don't lose sight for a moment of\nthe door of this house, and the moment you see anything, rush here on\nthe instant! as hard as you can go! You have a key to get in.\"\n\nThe eldest girl grumbled:--\n\n\"The idea of standing watch in the snow barefoot!\"\n\n\"To-morrow you shall have some dainty little green silk boots!\" said the\nfather.\n\nThey ran down stairs, and a few seconds later the shock of the outer\ndoor as it banged to announced that they were outside.\n\nThere now remained in the house only Marius, the Jondrettes and\nprobably, also, the mysterious persons of whom Marius had caught a\nglimpse in the twilight, behind the door of the unused attic.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVII--THE USE MADE OF MARIUS' FIVE-FRANC PIECE\n\nMarius decided that the moment had now arrived when he must resume his\npost at his observatory. In a twinkling, and with the agility of his\nage, he had reached the hole in the partition.\n\nHe looked.\n\nThe interior of the Jondrette apartment presented a curious aspect, and\nMarius found an explanation of the singular light which he had noticed.\nA candle was burning in a candlestick covered with verdigris, but\nthat was not what really lighted the chamber. The hovel was completely\nilluminated, as it were, by the reflection from a rather large\nsheet-iron brazier standing in the fireplace, and filled with burning\ncharcoal, the brazier prepared by the Jondrette woman that morning. The\ncharcoal was glowing hot and the brazier was red; a blue flame flickered\nover it, and helped him to make out the form of the chisel purchased by\nJondrette in the Rue Pierre-Lombard, where it had been thrust into the\nbrazier to heat. In one corner, near the door, and as though prepared\nfor some definite use, two heaps were visible, which appeared to be, the\none a heap of old iron, the other a heap of ropes. All this would have\ncaused the mind of a person who knew nothing of what was in preparation,\nto waver between a very sinister and a very simple idea. The lair thus\nlighted up more resembled a forge than a mouth of hell, but Jondrette,\nin this light, had rather the air of a demon than of a smith.\n\nThe heat of the brazier was so great, that the candle on the table was\nmelting on the side next the chafing-dish, and was drooping over. An old\ndark-lantern of copper, worthy of Diogenes turned Cartouche, stood on\nthe chimney-piece.\n\nThe brazier, placed in the fireplace itself, beside the nearly extinct\nbrands, sent its vapors up the chimney, and gave out no odor.\n\nThe moon, entering through the four panes of the window, cast its\nwhiteness into the crimson and flaming garret; and to the poetic spirit\nof Marius, who was dreamy even in the moment of action, it was like a\nthought of heaven mingled with the misshapen reveries of earth.\n\nA breath of air which made its way in through the open pane, helped to\ndissipate the smell of the charcoal and to conceal the presence of the\nbrazier.\n\nThe Jondrette lair was, if the reader recalls what we have said of the\nGorbeau building, admirably chosen to serve as the theatre of a violent\nand sombre deed, and as the envelope for a crime. It was the most\nretired chamber in the most isolated house on the most deserted\nboulevard in Paris. If the system of ambush and traps had not already\nexisted, they would have been invented there.\n\nThe whole thickness of a house and a multitude of uninhabited rooms\nseparated this den from the boulevard, and the only window that existed\nopened on waste lands enclosed with walls and palisades.\n\nJondrette had lighted his pipe, seated himself on the seatless chair,\nand was engaged in smoking. His wife was talking to him in a low tone.\n\nIf Marius had been Courfeyrac, that is to say, one of those men who\nlaugh on every occasion in life, he would have burst with laughter when\nhis gaze fell on the Jondrette woman. She had on a black bonnet with\nplumes not unlike the hats of the heralds-at-arms at the coronation of\nCharles X., an immense tartan shawl over her knitted petticoat, and the\nman's shoes which her daughter had scorned in the morning. It was this\ntoilette which had extracted from Jondrette the exclamation: \"Good! You\nhave dressed up. You have done well. You must inspire confidence!\"\n\nAs for Jondrette, he had not taken off the new surtout, which was too\nlarge for him, and which M. Leblanc had given him, and his costume\ncontinued to present that contrast of coat and trousers which\nconstituted the ideal of a poet in Courfeyrac's eyes.\n\nAll at once, Jondrette lifted up his voice:--\n\n\"By the way! Now that I think of it. In this weather, he will come in a\ncarriage. Light the lantern, take it and go down stairs. You will stand\nbehind the lower door. The very moment that you hear the carriage stop,\nyou will open the door, instantly, he will come up, you will light the\nstaircase and the corridor, and when he enters here, you will go down\nstairs again as speedily as possible, you will pay the coachman, and\ndismiss the fiacre.\"\n\n\"And the money?\" inquired the woman.\n\nJondrette fumbled in his trousers pocket and handed her five francs.\n\n\"What's this?\" she exclaimed.\n\nJondrette replied with dignity:--\n\n\"That is the monarch which our neighbor gave us this morning.\"\n\nAnd he added:--\n\n\"Do you know what? Two chairs will be needed here.\"\n\n\"What for?\"\n\n\"To sit on.\"\n\nMarius felt a cold chill pass through his limbs at hearing this mild\nanswer from Jondrette.\n\n\"Pardieu! I'll go and get one of our neighbor's.\"\n\nAnd with a rapid movement, she opened the door of the den, and went out\ninto the corridor.\n\nMarius absolutely had not the time to descend from the commode, reach\nhis bed, and conceal himself beneath it.\n\n\"Take the candle,\" cried Jondrette.\n\n\"No,\" said she, \"it would embarrass me, I have the two chairs to carry.\nThere is moonlight.\"\n\nMarius heard Mother Jondrette's heavy hand fumbling at his lock in the\ndark. The door opened. He remained nailed to the spot with the shock and\nwith horror.\n\nThe Jondrette entered.\n\nThe dormer window permitted the entrance of a ray of moonlight between\ntwo blocks of shadow. One of these blocks of shadow entirely covered the\nwall against which Marius was leaning, so that he disappeared within it.\n\nMother Jondrette raised her eyes, did not see Marius, took the two\nchairs, the only ones which Marius possessed, and went away, letting the\ndoor fall heavily to behind her.\n\nShe re-entered the lair.\n\n\"Here are the two chairs.\"\n\n\"And here is the lantern. Go down as quick as you can.\"\n\nShe hastily obeyed, and Jondrette was left alone.\n\nHe placed the two chairs on opposite sides of the table, turned the\nchisel in the brazier, set in front of the fireplace an old screen which\nmasked the chafing-dish, then went to the corner where lay the pile\nof rope, and bent down as though to examine something. Marius then\nrecognized the fact, that what he had taken for a shapeless mass was a\nvery well-made rope-ladder, with wooden rungs and two hooks with which\nto attach it.\n\nThis ladder, and some large tools, veritable masses of iron, which were\nmingled with the old iron piled up behind the door, had not been in the\nJondrette hovel in the morning, and had evidently been brought thither\nin the afternoon, during Marius' absence.\n\n\"Those are the utensils of an edge-tool maker,\" thought Marius.\n\nHad Marius been a little more learned in this line, he would have\nrecognized in what he took for the engines of an edge-tool maker,\ncertain instruments which will force a lock or pick a lock, and others\nwhich will cut or slice, the two families of tools which burglars call\ncadets and fauchants.\n\nThe fireplace and the two chairs were exactly opposite Marius. The\nbrazier being concealed, the only light in the room was now furnished\nby the candle; the smallest bit of crockery on the table or on the\nchimney-piece cast a large shadow. There was something indescribably\ncalm, threatening, and hideous about this chamber. One felt that there\nexisted in it the anticipation of something terrible.\n\nJondrette had allowed his pipe to go out, a serious sign of\npreoccupation, and had again seated himself. The candle brought out the\nfierce and the fine angles of his countenance. He indulged in scowls and\nin abrupt unfoldings of the right hand, as though he were responding to\nthe last counsels of a sombre inward monologue. In the course of one of\nthese dark replies which he was making to himself, he pulled the table\ndrawer rapidly towards him, took out a long kitchen knife which was\nconcealed there, and tried the edge of its blade on his nail. That done,\nhe put the knife back in the drawer and shut it.\n\nMarius, on his side, grasped the pistol in his right pocket, drew it out\nand cocked it.\n\nThe pistol emitted a sharp, clear click, as he cocked it.\n\nJondrette started, half rose, listened a moment, then began to laugh and\nsaid:--\n\n\"What a fool I am! It's the partition cracking!\"\n\nMarius kept the pistol in his hand.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVIII--MARIUS' TWO CHAIRS FORM A VIS-A-VIS\n\nSuddenly, the distant and melancholy vibration of a clock shook the\npanes. Six o'clock was striking from Saint-Medard.\n\nJondrette marked off each stroke with a toss of his head. When the sixth\nhad struck, he snuffed the candle with his fingers.\n\nThen he began to pace up and down the room, listened at the corridor,\nwalked on again, then listened once more.\n\n\"Provided only that he comes!\" he muttered, then he returned to his\nchair.\n\nHe had hardly reseated himself when the door opened.\n\nMother Jondrette had opened it, and now remained in the corridor making\na horrible, amiable grimace, which one of the holes of the dark-lantern\nilluminated from below.\n\n\"Enter, sir,\" she said.\n\n\"Enter, my benefactor,\" repeated Jondrette, rising hastily.\n\nM. Leblanc made his appearance.\n\nHe wore an air of serenity which rendered him singularly venerable.\n\nHe laid four louis on the table.\n\n\"Monsieur Fabantou,\" said he, \"this is for your rent and your most\npressing necessities. We will attend to the rest hereafter.\"\n\n\"May God requite it to you, my generous benefactor!\" said Jondrette.\n\nAnd rapidly approaching his wife:--\n\n\"Dismiss the carriage!\"\n\nShe slipped out while her husband was lavishing salutes and offering\nM. Leblanc a chair. An instant later she returned and whispered in his\near:--\n\n\"'Tis done.\"\n\nThe snow, which had not ceased falling since the morning, was so deep\nthat the arrival of the fiacre had not been audible, and they did not\nnow hear its departure.\n\nMeanwhile, M. Leblanc had seated himself.\n\nJondrette had taken possession of the other chair, facing M. Leblanc.\n\nNow, in order to form an idea of the scene which is to follow, let the\nreader picture to himself in his own mind, a cold night, the solitudes\nof the Salpetriere covered with snow and white as winding-sheets in\nthe moonlight, the taper-like lights of the street lanterns which shone\nredly here and there along those tragic boulevards, and the long rows\nof black elms, not a passer-by for perhaps a quarter of a league around,\nthe Gorbeau hovel, at its highest pitch of silence, of horror, and of\ndarkness; in that building, in the midst of those solitudes, in the\nmidst of that darkness, the vast Jondrette garret lighted by a single\ncandle, and in that den two men seated at a table, M. Leblanc tranquil,\nJondrette smiling and alarming, the Jondrette woman, the female wolf,\nin one corner, and, behind the partition, Marius, invisible, erect, not\nlosing a word, not missing a single movement, his eye on the watch, and\npistol in hand.\n\nHowever, Marius experienced only an emotion of horror, but no fear. He\nclasped the stock of the pistol firmly and felt reassured. \"I shall be\nable to stop that wretch whenever I please,\" he thought.\n\nHe felt that the police were there somewhere in ambuscade, waiting for\nthe signal agreed upon and ready to stretch out their arm.\n\nMoreover, he was in hopes, that this violent encounter between Jondrette\nand M. Leblanc would cast some light on all the things which he was\ninterested in learning.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIX--OCCUPYING ONE'S SELF WITH OBSCURE DEPTHS\n\nHardly was M. Leblanc seated, when he turned his eyes towards the\npallets, which were empty.\n\n\"How is the poor little wounded girl?\" he inquired.\n\n\"Bad,\" replied Jondrette with a heart-broken and grateful smile, \"very\nbad, my worthy sir. Her elder sister has taken her to the Bourbe to\nhave her hurt dressed. You will see them presently; they will be back\nimmediately.\"\n\n\"Madame Fabantou seems to me to be better,\" went on M. Leblanc, casting\nhis eyes on the eccentric costume of the Jondrette woman, as she stood\nbetween him and the door, as though already guarding the exit, and gazed\nat him in an attitude of menace and almost of combat.\n\n\"She is dying,\" said Jondrette. \"But what do you expect, sir! She has so\nmuch courage, that woman has! She's not a woman, she's an ox.\"\n\nThe Jondrette, touched by his compliment, deprecated it with the\naffected airs of a flattered monster.\n\n\"You are always too good to me, Monsieur Jondrette!\"\n\n\"Jondrette!\" said M. Leblanc, \"I thought your name was Fabantou?\"\n\n\"Fabantou, alias Jondrette!\" replied the husband hurriedly. \"An artistic\nsobriquet!\"\n\nAnd launching at his wife a shrug of the shoulders which M. Leblanc did\nnot catch, he continued with an emphatic and caressing inflection of\nvoice:--\n\n\"Ah! we have had a happy life together, this poor darling and I! What\nwould there be left for us if we had not that? We are so wretched, my\nrespectable sir! We have arms, but there is no work! We have the will,\nno work! I don't know how the government arranges that, but, on my word\nof honor, sir, I am not Jacobin, sir, I am not a bousingot.[30] I don't\nwish them any evil, but if I were the ministers, on my most sacred word,\nthings would be different. Here, for instance, I wanted to have my\ngirls taught the trade of paper-box makers. You will say to me: 'What!\na trade?' Yes! A trade! A simple trade! A bread-winner! What a fall,\nmy benefactor! What a degradation, when one has been what we have been!\nAlas! There is nothing left to us of our days of prosperity! One thing\nonly, a picture, of which I think a great deal, but which I am willing\nto part with, for I must live! Item, one must live!\"\n\nWhile Jondrette thus talked, with an apparent incoherence which\ndetracted nothing from the thoughtful and sagacious expression of his\nphysiognomy, Marius raised his eyes, and perceived at the other end of\nthe room a person whom he had not seen before. A man had just entered,\nso softly that the door had not been heard to turn on its hinges. This\nman wore a violet knitted vest, which was old, worn, spotted, cut and\ngaping at every fold, wide trousers of cotton velvet, wooden shoes on\nhis feet, no shirt, had his neck bare, his bare arms tattooed, and his\nface smeared with black. He had seated himself in silence on the nearest\nbed, and, as he was behind Jondrette, he could only be indistinctly\nseen.\n\nThat sort of magnetic instinct which turns aside the gaze, caused M.\nLeblanc to turn round almost at the same moment as Marius. He could not\nrefrain from a gesture of surprise which did not escape Jondrette.\n\n\"Ah! I see!\" exclaimed Jondrette, buttoning up his coat with an air of\ncomplaisance, \"you are looking at your overcoat? It fits me! My faith,\nbut it fits me!\"\n\n\"Who is that man?\" said M. Leblanc.\n\n\"Him?\" ejaculated Jondrette, \"he's a neighbor of mine. Don't pay any\nattention to him.\"\n\nThe neighbor was a singular-looking individual. However, manufactories\nof chemical products abound in the Faubourg Saint-Marceau. Many of the\nworkmen might have black faces. Besides this, M. Leblanc's whole person\nwas expressive of candid and intrepid confidence.\n\nHe went on:--\n\n\"Excuse me; what were you saying, M. Fabantou?\"\n\n\"I was telling you, sir, and dear protector,\" replied Jondrette placing\nhis elbows on the table and contemplating M. Leblanc with steady and\ntender eyes, not unlike the eyes of the boa-constrictor, \"I was telling\nyou, that I have a picture to sell.\"\n\nA slight sound came from the door. A second man had just entered and\nseated himself on the bed, behind Jondrette.\n\nLike the first, his arms were bare, and he had a mask of ink or\nlampblack.\n\nAlthough this man had, literally, glided into the room, he had not been\nable to prevent M. Leblanc catching sight of him.\n\n\"Don't mind them,\" said Jondrette, \"they are people who belong in the\nhouse. So I was saying, that there remains in my possession a valuable\npicture. But stop, sir, take a look at it.\"\n\nHe rose, went to the wall at the foot of which stood the panel which we\nhave already mentioned, and turned it round, still leaving it supported\nagainst the wall. It really was something which resembled a picture, and\nwhich the candle illuminated, somewhat. Marius could make nothing out of\nit, as Jondrette stood between the picture and him; he only saw a coarse\ndaub, and a sort of principal personage colored with the harsh crudity\nof foreign canvasses and screen paintings.\n\n\"What is that?\" asked M. Leblanc.\n\nJondrette exclaimed:--\n\n\"A painting by a master, a picture of great value, my benefactor! I am\nas much attached to it as I am to my two daughters; it recalls souvenirs\nto me! But I have told you, and I will not take it back, that I am so\nwretched that I will part with it.\"\n\nEither by chance, or because he had begun to feel a dawning uneasiness,\nM. Leblanc's glance returned to the bottom of the room as he examined\nthe picture.\n\nThere were now four men, three seated on the bed, one standing near the\ndoor-post, all four with bare arms and motionless, with faces smeared\nwith black. One of those on the bed was leaning against the wall, with\nclosed eyes, and it might have been supposed that he was asleep. He\nwas old; his white hair contrasting with his blackened face produced a\nhorrible effect. The other two seemed to be young; one wore a beard, the\nother wore his hair long. None of them had on shoes; those who did not\nwear socks were barefooted.\n\nJondrette noticed that M. Leblanc's eye was fixed on these men.\n\n\"They are friends. They are neighbors,\" said he. \"Their faces are black\nbecause they work in charcoal. They are chimney-builders. Don't trouble\nyourself about them, my benefactor, but buy my picture. Have pity on\nmy misery. I will not ask you much for it. How much do you think it is\nworth?\"\n\n\"Well,\" said M. Leblanc, looking Jondrette full in the eye, and with the\nmanner of a man who is on his guard, \"it is some signboard for a tavern,\nand is worth about three francs.\"\n\nJondrette replied sweetly:--\n\n\"Have you your pocket-book with you? I should be satisfied with a\nthousand crowns.\"\n\nM. Leblanc sprang up, placed his back against the wall, and cast a rapid\nglance around the room. He had Jondrette on his left, on the side next\nthe window, and the Jondrette woman and the four men on his right, on\nthe side next the door. The four men did not stir, and did not even seem\nto be looking on.\n\nJondrette had again begun to speak in a plaintive tone, with so vague\nan eye, and so lamentable an intonation, that M. Leblanc might have\nsupposed that what he had before him was a man who had simply gone mad\nwith misery.\n\n\"If you do not buy my picture, my dear benefactor,\" said Jondrette, \"I\nshall be left without resources; there will be nothing left for me but\nto throw myself into the river. When I think that I wanted to have my\ntwo girls taught the middle-class paper-box trade, the making of boxes\nfor New Year's gifts! Well! A table with a board at the end to keep the\nglasses from falling off is required, then a special stove is needed, a\npot with three compartments for the different degrees of strength of\nthe paste, according as it is to be used for wood, paper, or stuff, a\nparing-knife to cut the cardboard, a mould to adjust it, a hammer to\nnail the steels, pincers, how the devil do I know what all? And all that\nin order to earn four sous a day! And you have to work fourteen hours a\nday! And each box passes through the workwoman's hands thirteen times!\nAnd you can't wet the paper! And you mustn't spot anything! And you must\nkeep the paste hot. The devil, I tell you! Four sous a day! How do you\nsuppose a man is to live?\"\n\nAs he spoke, Jondrette did not look at M. Leblanc, who was observing\nhim. M. Leblanc's eye was fixed on Jondrette, and Jondrette's eye was\nfixed on the door. Marius' eager attention was transferred from one\nto the other. M. Leblanc seemed to be asking himself: \"Is this man an\nidiot?\" Jondrette repeated two or three distinct times, with all manner\nof varying inflections of the whining and supplicating order: \"There\nis nothing left for me but to throw myself into the river! I went down\nthree steps at the side of the bridge of Austerlitz the other day for\nthat purpose.\"\n\nAll at once his dull eyes lighted up with a hideous flash; the little\nman drew himself up and became terrible, took a step toward M. Leblanc\nand cried in a voice of thunder: \"That has nothing to do with the\nquestion! Do you know me?\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XX--THE TRAP\n\nThe door of the garret had just opened abruptly, and allowed a view of\nthree men clad in blue linen blouses, and masked with masks of black\npaper. The first was thin, and had a long, iron-tipped cudgel; the\nsecond, who was a sort of colossus, carried, by the middle of the\nhandle, with the blade downward, a butcher's pole-axe for slaughtering\ncattle. The third, a man with thick-set shoulders, not so slender as\nthe first, held in his hand an enormous key stolen from the door of some\nprison.\n\nIt appeared that the arrival of these men was what Jondrette had been\nwaiting for. A rapid dialogue ensued between him and the man with the\ncudgel, the thin one.\n\n\"Is everything ready?\" said Jondrette.\n\n\"Yes,\" replied the thin man.\n\n\"Where is Montparnasse?\"\n\n\"The young principal actor stopped to chat with your girl.\"\n\n\"Which?\"\n\n\"The eldest.\"\n\n\"Is there a carriage at the door?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Is the team harnessed?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"With two good horses?\"\n\n\"Excellent.\"\n\n\"Is it waiting where I ordered?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Good,\" said Jondrette.\n\nM. Leblanc was very pale. He was scrutinizing everything around him in\nthe den, like a man who understands what he has fallen into, and his\nhead, directed in turn toward all the heads which surrounded him, moved\non his neck with an astonished and attentive slowness, but there\nwas nothing in his air which resembled fear. He had improvised\nan intrenchment out of the table; and the man, who but an instant\npreviously, had borne merely the appearance of a kindly old man, had\nsuddenly become a sort of athlete, and placed his robust fist on the\nback of his chair, with a formidable and surprising gesture.\n\nThis old man, who was so firm and so brave in the presence of such a\ndanger, seemed to possess one of those natures which are as courageous\nas they are kind, both easily and simply. The father of a woman whom we\nlove is never a stranger to us. Marius felt proud of that unknown man.\n\nThree of the men, of whom Jondrette had said: \"They are\nchimney-builders,\" had armed themselves from the pile of old iron, one\nwith a heavy pair of shears, the second with weighing-tongs, the third\nwith a hammer, and had placed themselves across the entrance without\nuttering a syllable. The old man had remained on the bed, and had merely\nopened his eyes. The Jondrette woman had seated herself beside him.\n\nMarius decided that in a few seconds more the moment for intervention\nwould arrive, and he raised his right hand towards the ceiling, in the\ndirection of the corridor, in readiness to discharge his pistol.\n\nJondrette having terminated his colloquy with the man with the cudgel,\nturned once more to M. Leblanc, and repeated his question, accompanying\nit with that low, repressed, and terrible laugh which was peculiar to\nhim:--\n\n\"So you do not recognize me?\"\n\nM. Leblanc looked him full in the face, and replied:--\n\n\"No.\"\n\nThen Jondrette advanced to the table. He leaned across the candle,\ncrossing his arms, putting his angular and ferocious jaw close to M.\nLeblanc's calm face, and advancing as far as possible without forcing M.\nLeblanc to retreat, and, in this posture of a wild beast who is about to\nbite, he exclaimed:--\n\n\"My name is not Fabantou, my name is not Jondrette, my name is\nThenardier. I am the inn-keeper of Montfermeil! Do you understand?\nThenardier! Now do you know me?\"\n\nAn almost imperceptible flush crossed M. Leblanc's brow, and he replied\nwith a voice which neither trembled nor rose above its ordinary level,\nwith his accustomed placidity:--\n\n\"No more than before.\"\n\nMarius did not hear this reply. Any one who had seen him at that moment\nthrough the darkness would have perceived that he was haggard,\nstupid, thunder-struck. At the moment when Jondrette said: \"My name is\nThenardier,\" Marius had trembled in every limb, and had leaned against\nthe wall, as though he felt the cold of a steel blade through his heart.\nThen his right arm, all ready to discharge the signal shot, dropped\nslowly, and at the moment when Jondrette repeated, \"Thenardier, do you\nunderstand?\" Marius's faltering fingers had come near letting the pistol\nfall. Jondrette, by revealing his identity, had not moved M. Leblanc,\nbut he had quite upset Marius. That name of Thenardier, with which M.\nLeblanc did not seem to be acquainted, Marius knew well. Let the reader\nrecall what that name meant to him! That name he had worn on his heart,\ninscribed in his father's testament! He bore it at the bottom of his\nmind, in the depths of his memory, in that sacred injunction: \"A certain\nThenardier saved my life. If my son encounters him, he will do him all\nthe good that lies in his power.\" That name, it will be remembered,\nwas one of the pieties of his soul; he mingled it with the name of\nhis father in his worship. What! This man was that Thenardier, that\ninn-keeper of Montfermeil whom he had so long and so vainly sought! He\nhad found him at last, and how? His father's saviour was a ruffian!\nThat man, to whose service Marius was burning to devote himself, was\na monster! That liberator of Colonel Pontmercy was on the point\nof committing a crime whose scope Marius did not, as yet, clearly\ncomprehend, but which resembled an assassination! And against whom,\ngreat God! what a fatality! What a bitter mockery of fate! His father\nhad commanded him from the depths of his coffin to do all the good in\nhis power to this Thenardier, and for four years Marius had cherished\nno other thought than to acquit this debt of his father's, and at the\nmoment when he was on the eve of having a brigand seized in the very\nact of crime by justice, destiny cried to him: \"This is Thenardier!\"\nHe could at last repay this man for his father's life, saved amid a\nhail-storm of grape-shot on the heroic field of Waterloo, and repay it\nwith the scaffold! He had sworn to himself that if ever he found that\nThenardier, he would address him only by throwing himself at his feet;\nand now he actually had found him, but it was only to deliver him over\nto the executioner! His father said to him: \"Succor Thenardier!\" And he\nreplied to that adored and sainted voice by crushing Thenardier! He was\nabout to offer to his father in his grave the spectacle of that man who\nhad torn him from death at the peril of his own life, executed on the\nPlace Saint-Jacques through the means of his son, of that Marius to whom\nhe had entrusted that man by his will! And what a mockery to have so\nlong worn on his breast his father's last commands, written in his own\nhand, only to act in so horribly contrary a sense! But, on the other\nhand, now look on that trap and not prevent it! Condemn the victim and\nto spare the assassin! Could one be held to any gratitude towards so\nmiserable a wretch? All the ideas which Marius had cherished for the\nlast four years were pierced through and through, as it were, by this\nunforeseen blow.\n\nHe shuddered. Everything depended on him. Unknown to themselves, he\nheld in his hand all those beings who were moving about there before his\neyes. If he fired his pistol, M. Leblanc was saved, and Thenardier lost;\nif he did not fire, M. Leblanc would be sacrificed, and, who knows?\nThenardier would escape. Should he dash down the one or allow the other\nto fall? Remorse awaited him in either case.\n\nWhat was he to do? What should he choose? Be false to the most imperious\nsouvenirs, to all those solemn vows to himself, to the most sacred duty,\nto the most venerated text! Should he ignore his father's testament,\nor allow the perpetration of a crime! On the one hand, it seemed to him\nthat he heard \"his Ursule\" supplicating for her father and on the other,\nthe colonel commending Thenardier to his care. He felt that he was going\nmad. His knees gave way beneath him. And he had not even the time for\ndeliberation, so great was the fury with which the scene before his eyes\nwas hastening to its catastrophe. It was like a whirlwind of which he\nhad thought himself the master, and which was now sweeping him away. He\nwas on the verge of swooning.\n\nIn the meantime, Thenardier, whom we shall henceforth call by no other\nname, was pacing up and down in front of the table in a sort of frenzy\nand wild triumph.\n\nHe seized the candle in his fist, and set it on the chimney-piece with\nso violent a bang that the wick came near being extinguished, and the\ntallow bespattered the wall.\n\nThen he turned to M. Leblanc with a horrible look, and spit out these\nwords:--\n\n\"Done for! Smoked brown! Cooked! Spitchcocked!\"\n\nAnd again he began to march back and forth, in full eruption.\n\n\"Ah!\" he cried, \"so I've found you again at last, Mister philanthropist!\nMister threadbare millionnaire! Mister giver of dolls! you old\nninny! Ah! so you don't recognize me! No, it wasn't you who came to\nMontfermeil, to my inn, eight years ago, on Christmas eve, 1823! It\nwasn't you who carried off that Fantine's child from me! The Lark! It\nwasn't you who had a yellow great-coat! No! Nor a package of duds in\nyour hand, as you had this morning here! Say, wife, it seems to be his\nmania to carry packets of woollen stockings into houses! Old charity\nmonger, get out with you! Are you a hosier, Mister millionnaire? You\ngive away your stock in trade to the poor, holy man! What bosh! merry\nAndrew! Ah! and you don't recognize me? Well, I recognize you, that I\ndo! I recognized you the very moment you poked your snout in here. Ah!\nyou'll find out presently, that it isn't all roses to thrust yourself\nin that fashion into people's houses, under the pretext that they are\ntaverns, in wretched clothes, with the air of a poor man, to whom one\nwould give a sou, to deceive persons, to play the generous, to take away\ntheir means of livelihood, and to make threats in the woods, and you\ncan't call things quits because afterwards, when people are ruined, you\nbring a coat that is too large, and two miserable hospital blankets, you\nold blackguard, you child-stealer!\"\n\nHe paused, and seemed to be talking to himself for a moment. One would\nhave said that his wrath had fallen into some hole, like the Rhone;\nthen, as though he were concluding aloud the things which he had been\nsaying to himself in a whisper, he smote the table with his fist, and\nshouted:--\n\n\"And with his goody-goody air!\"\n\nAnd, apostrophizing M. Leblanc:--\n\n\"Parbleu! You made game of me in the past! You are the cause of all my\nmisfortunes! For fifteen hundred francs you got a girl whom I had, and\nwho certainly belonged to rich people, and who had already brought in a\ngreat deal of money, and from whom I might have extracted enough to live\non all my life! A girl who would have made up to me for everything that\nI lost in that vile cook-shop, where there was nothing but one continual\nrow, and where, like a fool, I ate up my last farthing! Oh! I wish all\nthe wine folks drank in my house had been poison to those who drank it!\nWell, never mind! Say, now! You must have thought me ridiculous when you\nwent off with the Lark! You had your cudgel in the forest. You were the\nstronger. Revenge. I'm the one to hold the trumps to-day! You're in a\nsorry case, my good fellow! Oh, but I can laugh! Really, I laugh! Didn't\nhe fall into the trap! I told him that I was an actor, that my name was\nFabantou, that I had played comedy with Mamselle Mars, with Mamselle\nMuche, that my landlord insisted on being paid tomorrow, the 4th of\nFebruary, and he didn't even notice that the 8th of January, and not the\n4th of February is the time when the quarter runs out! Absurd idiot!\nAnd the four miserable Philippes which he has brought me! Scoundrel!\nHe hadn't the heart even to go as high as a hundred francs! And how\nhe swallowed my platitudes! That did amuse me. I said to myself:\n'Blockhead! Come, I've got you! I lick your paws this morning, but I'll\ngnaw your heart this evening!'\"\n\nThenardier paused. He was out of breath. His little, narrow chest panted\nlike a forge bellows. His eyes were full of the ignoble happiness of a\nfeeble, cruel, and cowardly creature, which finds that it can, at last,\nharass what it has feared, and insult what it has flattered, the joy of\na dwarf who should be able to set his heel on the head of Goliath, the\njoy of a jackal which is beginning to rend a sick bull, so nearly dead\nthat he can no longer defend himself, but sufficiently alive to suffer\nstill.\n\nM. Leblanc did not interrupt him, but said to him when he paused:--\n\n\"I do not know what you mean to say. You are mistaken in me. I am a very\npoor man, and anything but a millionnaire. I do not know you. You are\nmistaking me for some other person.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" roared Thenardier hoarsely, \"a pretty lie! You stick to that\npleasantry, do you! You're floundering, my old buck! Ah! You don't\nremember! You don't see who I am?\"\n\n\"Excuse me, sir,\" said M. Leblanc with a politeness of accent, which at\nthat moment seemed peculiarly strange and powerful, \"I see that you are\na villain!\"\n\nWho has not remarked the fact that odious creatures possess a\nsusceptibility of their own, that monsters are ticklish! At this word\n\"villain,\" the female Thenardier sprang from the bed, Thenardier grasped\nhis chair as though he were about to crush it in his hands. \"Don't you\nstir!\" he shouted to his wife; and, turning to M. Leblanc:--\n\n\"Villain! Yes, I know that you call us that, you rich gentlemen! Stop!\nit's true that I became bankrupt, that I am in hiding, that I have no\nbread, that I have not a single sou, that I am a villain! It's three\ndays since I have had anything to eat, so I'm a villain! Ah! you folks\nwarm your feet, you have Sakoski boots, you have wadded great-coats,\nlike archbishops, you lodge on the first floor in houses that have\nporters, you eat truffles, you eat asparagus at forty francs the bunch\nin the month of January, and green peas, you gorge yourselves, and when\nyou want to know whether it is cold, you look in the papers to see what\nthe engineer Chevalier's thermometer says about it. We, it is we who are\nthermometers. We don't need to go out and look on the quay at the corner\nof the Tour de l'Horologe, to find out the number of degrees of cold;\nwe feel our blood congealing in our veins, and the ice forming round our\nhearts, and we say: 'There is no God!' And you come to our caverns, yes\nour caverns, for the purpose of calling us villains! But we'll devour\nyou! But we'll devour you, poor little things! Just see here, Mister\nmillionnaire: I have been a solid man, I have held a license, I have\nbeen an elector, I am a bourgeois, that I am! And it's quite possible\nthat you are not!\"\n\nHere Thenardier took a step towards the men who stood near the door, and\nadded with a shudder:--\n\n\"When I think that he has dared to come here and talk to me like a\ncobbler!\"\n\nThen addressing M. Leblanc with a fresh outburst of frenzy:--\n\n\"And listen to this also, Mister philanthropist! I'm not a suspicious\ncharacter, not a bit of it! I'm not a man whose name nobody knows, and\nwho comes and abducts children from houses! I'm an old French soldier,\nI ought to have been decorated! I was at Waterloo, so I was! And in the\nbattle I saved a general called the Comte of I don't know what. He told\nme his name, but his beastly voice was so weak that I didn't hear. All I\ncaught was Merci [thanks]. I'd rather have had his name than his thanks.\nThat would have helped me to find him again. The picture that you see\nhere, and which was painted by David at Bruqueselles,--do you know what\nit represents? It represents me. David wished to immortalize that\nfeat of prowess. I have that general on my back, and I am carrying him\nthrough the grape-shot. There's the history of it! That general never\ndid a single thing for me; he was no better than the rest! But none the\nless, I saved his life at the risk of my own, and I have the certificate\nof the fact in my pocket! I am a soldier of Waterloo, by all the furies!\nAnd now that I have had the goodness to tell you all this, let's have an\nend of it. I want money, I want a deal of money, I must have an enormous\nlot of money, or I'll exterminate you, by the thunder of the good God!\"\n\nMarius had regained some measure of control over his anguish, and was\nlistening. The last possibility of doubt had just vanished. It certainly\nwas the Thenardier of the will. Marius shuddered at that reproach of\ningratitude directed against his father, and which he was on the point\nof so fatally justifying. His perplexity was redoubled.\n\nMoreover, there was in all these words of Thenardier, in his accent, in\nhis gesture, in his glance which darted flames at every word, there\nwas, in this explosion of an evil nature disclosing everything, in that\nmixture of braggadocio and abjectness, of pride and pettiness, of rage\nand folly, in that chaos of real griefs and false sentiments, in\nthat immodesty of a malicious man tasting the voluptuous delights\nof violence, in that shameless nudity of a repulsive soul, in that\nconflagration of all sufferings combined with all hatreds, something\nwhich was as hideous as evil, and as heart-rending as the truth.\n\nThe picture of the master, the painting by David which he had proposed\nthat M. Leblanc should purchase, was nothing else, as the reader has\ndivined, than the sign of his tavern painted, as it will be remembered,\nby himself, the only relic which he had preserved from his shipwreck at\nMontfermeil.\n\nAs he had ceased to intercept Marius' visual ray, Marius could examine\nthis thing, and in the daub, he actually did recognize a battle, a\nbackground of smoke, and a man carrying another man. It was the group\ncomposed of Pontmercy and Thenardier; the sergeant the rescuer, the\ncolonel rescued. Marius was like a drunken man; this picture restored\nhis father to life in some sort; it was no longer the signboard of the\nwine-shop at Montfermeil, it was a resurrection; a tomb had yawned, a\nphantom had risen there. Marius heard his heart beating in his temples,\nhe had the cannon of Waterloo in his ears, his bleeding father, vaguely\ndepicted on that sinister panel terrified him, and it seemed to him that\nthe misshapen spectre was gazing intently at him.\n\nWhen Thenardier had recovered his breath, he turned his bloodshot eyes\non M. Leblanc, and said to him in a low, curt voice:--\n\n\"What have you to say before we put the handcuffs on you?\"\n\nM. Leblanc held his peace.\n\nIn the midst of this silence, a cracked voice launched this lugubrious\nsarcasm from the corridor:--\n\n\"If there's any wood to be split, I'm there!\"\n\nIt was the man with the axe, who was growing merry.\n\nAt the same moment, an enormous, bristling, and clayey face made its\nappearance at the door, with a hideous laugh which exhibited not teeth,\nbut fangs.\n\nIt was the face of the man with the butcher's axe.\n\n\"Why have you taken off your mask?\" cried Thenardier in a rage.\n\n\"For fun,\" retorted the man.\n\nFor the last few minutes M. Leblanc had appeared to be watching and\nfollowing all the movements of Thenardier, who, blinded and dazzled by\nhis own rage, was stalking to and fro in the den with full confidence\nthat the door was guarded, and of holding an unarmed man fast, he being\narmed himself, of being nine against one, supposing that the female\nThenardier counted for but one man.\n\nDuring his address to the man with the pole-axe, he had turned his back\nto M. Leblanc.\n\nM. Leblanc seized this moment, overturned the chair with his foot and\nthe table with his fist, and with one bound, with prodigious agility,\nbefore Thenardier had time to turn round, he had reached the window. To\nopen it, to scale the frame, to bestride it, was the work of a second\nonly. He was half out when six robust fists seized him and dragged\nhim back energetically into the hovel. These were the three\n\"chimney-builders,\" who had flung themselves upon him. At the same time\nthe Thenardier woman had wound her hands in his hair.\n\nAt the trampling which ensued, the other ruffians rushed up from the\ncorridor. The old man on the bed, who seemed under the influence\nof wine, descended from the pallet and came reeling up, with a\nstone-breaker's hammer in his hand.\n\nOne of the \"chimney-builders,\" whose smirched face was lighted up by\nthe candle, and in whom Marius recognized, in spite of his daubing,\nPanchaud, alias Printanier, alias Bigrenaille, lifted above M. Leblanc's\nhead a sort of bludgeon made of two balls of lead, at the two ends of a\nbar of iron.\n\nMarius could not resist this sight. \"My father,\" he thought, \"forgive\nme!\"\n\nAnd his finger sought the trigger of his pistol.\n\nThe shot was on the point of being discharged when Thenardier's voice\nshouted:--\n\n\"Don't harm him!\"\n\nThis desperate attempt of the victim, far from exasperating Thenardier,\nhad calmed him. There existed in him two men, the ferocious man and\nthe adroit man. Up to that moment, in the excess of his triumph in the\npresence of the prey which had been brought down, and which did not\nstir, the ferocious man had prevailed; when the victim struggled and\ntried to resist, the adroit man reappeared and took the upper hand.\n\n\"Don't hurt him!\" he repeated, and without suspecting it, his first\nsuccess was to arrest the pistol in the act of being discharged, and to\nparalyze Marius, in whose opinion the urgency of the case disappeared,\nand who, in the face of this new phase, saw no inconvenience in waiting\na while longer.\n\nWho knows whether some chance would not arise which would deliver him\nfrom the horrible alternative of allowing Ursule's father to perish, or\nof destroying the colonel's saviour?\n\nA herculean struggle had begun. With one blow full in the chest, M.\nLeblanc had sent the old man tumbling, rolling in the middle of the\nroom, then with two backward sweeps of his hand he had overthrown two\nmore assailants, and he held one under each of his knees; the wretches\nwere rattling in the throat beneath this pressure as under a granite\nmillstone; but the other four had seized the formidable old man by both\narms and the back of his neck, and were holding him doubled up over the\ntwo \"chimney-builders\" on the floor.\n\nThus, the master of some and mastered by the rest, crushing those\nbeneath him and stifling under those on top of him, endeavoring in vain\nto shake off all the efforts which were heaped upon him, M. Leblanc\ndisappeared under the horrible group of ruffians like the wild boar\nbeneath a howling pile of dogs and hounds.\n\nThey succeeded in overthrowing him upon the bed nearest the window, and\nthere they held him in awe. The Thenardier woman had not released her\nclutch on his hair.\n\n\"Don't you mix yourself up in this affair,\" said Thenardier. \"You'll\ntear your shawl.\"\n\nThe Thenardier obeyed, as the female wolf obeys the male wolf, with a\ngrowl.\n\n\"Now,\" said Thenardier, \"search him, you other fellows!\"\n\nM. Leblanc seemed to have renounced the idea of resistance.\n\nThey searched him.\n\nHe had nothing on his person except a leather purse containing six\nfrancs, and his handkerchief.\n\nThenardier put the handkerchief into his own pocket.\n\n\"What! No pocket-book?\" he demanded.\n\n\"No, nor watch,\" replied one of the \"chimney-builders.\"\n\n\"Never mind,\" murmured the masked man who carried the big key, in the\nvoice of a ventriloquist, \"he's a tough old fellow.\"\n\nThenardier went to the corner near the door, picked up a bundle of ropes\nand threw them at the men.\n\n\"Tie him to the leg of the bed,\" said he.\n\nAnd, catching sight of the old man who had been stretched across the\nroom by the blow from M. Leblanc's fist, and who made no movement, he\nadded:--\n\n\"Is Boulatruelle dead?\"\n\n\"No,\" replied Bigrenaille, \"he's drunk.\"\n\n\"Sweep him into a corner,\" said Thenardier.\n\nTwo of the \"chimney-builders\" pushed the drunken man into the corner\nnear the heap of old iron with their feet.\n\n\"Babet,\" said Thenardier in a low tone to the man with the cudgel, \"why\ndid you bring so many; they were not needed.\"\n\n\"What can you do?\" replied the man with the cudgel, \"they all wanted to\nbe in it. This is a bad season. There's no business going on.\"\n\nThe pallet on which M. Leblanc had been thrown was a sort of hospital\nbed, elevated on four coarse wooden legs, roughly hewn.\n\nM. Leblanc let them take their own course.\n\nThe ruffians bound him securely, in an upright attitude, with his feet\non the ground at the head of the bed, the end which was most remote from\nthe window, and nearest to the fireplace.\n\nWhen the last knot had been tied, Thenardier took a chair and seated\nhimself almost facing M. Leblanc.\n\nThenardier no longer looked like himself; in the course of a few moments\nhis face had passed from unbridled violence to tranquil and cunning\nsweetness.\n\nMarius found it difficult to recognize in that polished smile of a man\nin official life the almost bestial mouth which had been foaming but a\nmoment before; he gazed with amazement on that fantastic and alarming\nmetamorphosis, and he felt as a man might feel who should behold a tiger\nconverted into a lawyer.\n\n\"Monsieur--\" said Thenardier.\n\nAnd dismissing with a gesture the ruffians who still kept their hands on\nM. Leblanc:--\n\n\"Stand off a little, and let me have a talk with the gentleman.\"\n\nAll retired towards the door.\n\nHe went on:--\n\n\"Monsieur, you did wrong to try to jump out of the window. You might\nhave broken your leg. Now, if you will permit me, we will converse\nquietly. In the first place, I must communicate to you an observation\nwhich I have made which is, that you have not uttered the faintest cry.\"\n\nThenardier was right, this detail was correct, although it had escaped\nMarius in his agitation. M. Leblanc had barely pronounced a few words,\nwithout raising his voice, and even during his struggle with the six\nruffians near the window he had preserved the most profound and singular\nsilence.\n\nThenardier continued:--\n\n\"Mon Dieu! You might have shouted 'stop thief' a bit, and I should not\nhave thought it improper. 'Murder!' That, too, is said occasionally,\nand, so far as I am concerned, I should not have taken it in bad part.\nIt is very natural that you should make a little row when you find\nyourself with persons who don't inspire you with sufficient confidence.\nYou might have done that, and no one would have troubled you on that\naccount. You would not even have been gagged. And I will tell you why.\nThis room is very private. That's its only recommendation, but it has\nthat in its favor. You might fire off a mortar and it would produce\nabout as much noise at the nearest police station as the snores of a\ndrunken man. Here a cannon would make a boum, and the thunder would make\na pouf. It's a handy lodging. But, in short, you did not shout, and\nit is better so. I present you my compliments, and I will tell you the\nconclusion that I draw from that fact: My dear sir, when a man shouts,\nwho comes? The police. And after the police? Justice. Well! You have not\nmade an outcry; that is because you don't care to have the police and\nthe courts come in any more than we do. It is because,--I have long\nsuspected it,--you have some interest in hiding something. On our side\nwe have the same interest. So we can come to an understanding.\"\n\nAs he spoke thus, it seemed as though Thenardier, who kept his eyes\nfixed on M. Leblanc, were trying to plunge the sharp points which darted\nfrom the pupils into the very conscience of his prisoner. Moreover, his\nlanguage, which was stamped with a sort of moderated, subdued insolence\nand crafty insolence, was reserved and almost choice, and in that\nrascal, who had been nothing but a robber a short time previously, one\nnow felt \"the man who had studied for the priesthood.\"\n\nThe silence preserved by the prisoner, that precaution which had been\ncarried to the point of forgetting all anxiety for his own life, that\nresistance opposed to the first impulse of nature, which is to utter\na cry, all this, it must be confessed, now that his attention had\nbeen called to it, troubled Marius, and affected him with painful\nastonishment.\n\nThenardier's well-grounded observation still further obscured for Marius\nthe dense mystery which enveloped that grave and singular person on whom\nCourfeyrac had bestowed the sobriquet of Monsieur Leblanc.\n\nBut whoever he was, bound with ropes, surrounded with executioners, half\nplunged, so to speak, in a grave which was closing in upon him to the\nextent of a degree with every moment that passed, in the presence\nof Thenardier's wrath, as in the presence of his sweetness, this man\nremained impassive; and Marius could not refrain from admiring at such a\nmoment the superbly melancholy visage.\n\nHere, evidently, was a soul which was inaccessible to terror, and which\ndid not know the meaning of despair. Here was one of those men who\ncommand amazement in desperate circumstances. Extreme as was the crisis,\ninevitable as was the catastrophe, there was nothing here of the agony\nof the drowning man, who opens his horror-filled eyes under the water.\n\nThenardier rose in an unpretending manner, went to the fireplace, shoved\naside the screen, which he leaned against the neighboring pallet, and\nthus unmasked the brazier full of glowing coals, in which the prisoner\ncould plainly see the chisel white-hot and spotted here and there with\ntiny scarlet stars.\n\nThen Thenardier returned to his seat beside M. Leblanc.\n\n\"I continue,\" said he. \"We can come to an understanding. Let us arrange\nthis matter in an amicable way. I was wrong to lose my temper just now,\nI don't know what I was thinking of, I went a great deal too far, I said\nextravagant things. For example, because you are a millionnaire, I told\nyou that I exacted money, a lot of money, a deal of money. That would\nnot be reasonable. Mon Dieu, in spite of your riches, you have expenses\nof your own--who has not? I don't want to ruin you, I am not a greedy\nfellow, after all. I am not one of those people who, because they have\nthe advantage of the position, profit by the fact to make themselves\nridiculous. Why, I'm taking things into consideration and making a\nsacrifice on my side. I only want two hundred thousand francs.\"\n\nM. Leblanc uttered not a word.\n\nThenardier went on:--\n\n\"You see that I put not a little water in my wine; I'm very moderate. I\ndon't know the state of your fortune, but I do know that you don't stick\nat money, and a benevolent man like yourself can certainly give two\nhundred thousand francs to the father of a family who is out of luck.\nCertainly, you are reasonable, too; you haven't imagined that I should\ntake all the trouble I have to-day and organized this affair this\nevening, which has been labor well bestowed, in the opinion of these\ngentlemen, merely to wind up by asking you for enough to go and drink\nred wine at fifteen sous and eat veal at Desnoyer's. Two hundred\nthousand francs--it's surely worth all that. This trifle once out of\nyour pocket, I guarantee you that that's the end of the matter, and that\nyou have no further demands to fear. You will say to me: 'But I haven't\ntwo hundred thousand francs about me.' Oh! I'm not extortionate. I don't\ndemand that. I only ask one thing of you. Have the goodness to write\nwhat I am about to dictate to you.\"\n\nHere Thenardier paused; then he added, emphasizing his words, and\ncasting a smile in the direction of the brazier:--\n\n\"I warn you that I shall not admit that you don't know how to write.\"\n\nA grand inquisitor might have envied that smile.\n\nThenardier pushed the table close to M. Leblanc, and took an inkstand,\na pen, and a sheet of paper from the drawer which he left half open, and\nin which gleamed the long blade of the knife.\n\nHe placed the sheet of paper before M. Leblanc.\n\n\"Write,\" said he.\n\nThe prisoner spoke at last.\n\n\"How do you expect me to write? I am bound.\"\n\n\"That's true, excuse me!\" ejaculated Thenardier, \"you are quite right.\"\n\nAnd turning to Bigrenaille:--\n\n\"Untie the gentleman's right arm.\"\n\nPanchaud, alias Printanier, alias Bigrenaille, executed Thenardier's\norder.\n\nWhen the prisoner's right arm was free, Thenardier dipped the pen in the\nink and presented it to him.\n\n\"Understand thoroughly, sir, that you are in our power, at our\ndiscretion, that no human power can get you out of this, and that we\nshall be really grieved if we are forced to proceed to disagreeable\nextremities. I know neither your name, nor your address, but I warn you,\nthat you will remain bound until the person charged with carrying the\nletter which you are about to write shall have returned. Now, be so good\nas to write.\"\n\n\"What?\" demanded the prisoner.\n\n\"I will dictate.\"\n\nM. Leblanc took the pen.\n\nThenardier began to dictate:--\n\n\"My daughter--\"\n\nThe prisoner shuddered, and raised his eyes to Thenardier.\n\n\"Put down 'My dear daughter'--\" said Thenardier.\n\nM. Leblanc obeyed.\n\nThenardier continued:--\n\n\"Come instantly--\"\n\nHe paused:--\n\n\"You address her as thou, do you not?\"\n\n\"Who?\" asked M. Leblanc.\n\n\"Parbleu!\" cried Thenardier, \"the little one, the Lark.\"\n\nM. Leblanc replied without the slightest apparent emotion:--\n\n\"I do not know what you mean.\"\n\n\"Go on, nevertheless,\" ejaculated Thenardier, and he continued to\ndictate:--\n\n\"Come immediately, I am in absolute need of thee. The person who will\ndeliver this note to thee is instructed to conduct thee to me. I am\nwaiting for thee. Come with confidence.\"\n\nM. Leblanc had written the whole of this.\n\nThenardier resumed:--\n\n\"Ah! erase 'come with confidence'; that might lead her to suppose that\neverything was not as it should be, and that distrust is possible.\"\n\nM. Leblanc erased the three words.\n\n\"Now,\" pursued Thenardier, \"sign it. What's your name?\"\n\nThe prisoner laid down the pen and demanded:--\n\n\"For whom is this letter?\"\n\n\"You know well,\" retorted Thenardier, \"for the little one I just told\nyou so.\"\n\nIt was evident that Thenardier avoided naming the young girl in\nquestion. He said \"the Lark,\" he said \"the little one,\" but he did not\npronounce her name--the precaution of a clever man guarding his secret\nfrom his accomplices. To mention the name was to deliver the whole\n\"affair\" into their hands, and to tell them more about it than there was\nany need of their knowing.\n\nHe went on:--\n\n\"Sign. What is your name?\"\n\n\"Urbain Fabre,\" said the prisoner.\n\nThenardier, with the movement of a cat, dashed his hand into his pocket\nand drew out the handkerchief which had been seized on M. Leblanc. He\nlooked for the mark on it, and held it close to the candle.\n\n\"U. F. That's it. Urbain Fabre. Well, sign it U. F.\"\n\nThe prisoner signed.\n\n\"As two hands are required to fold the letter, give it to me, I will\nfold it.\"\n\nThat done, Thenardier resumed:--\n\n\"Address it, 'Mademoiselle Fabre,' at your house. I know that you live\na long distance from here, near Saint-Jacquesdu-Haut-Pas, because you go\nto mass there every day, but I don't know in what street. I see that\nyou understand your situation. As you have not lied about your name, you\nwill not lie about your address. Write it yourself.\"\n\nThe prisoner paused thoughtfully for a moment, then he took the pen and\nwrote:--\n\n\"Mademoiselle Fabre, at M. Urbain Fabre's, Rue Saint-Dominique-D'Enfer,\nNo. 17.\"\n\nThenardier seized the letter with a sort of feverish convulsion.\n\n\"Wife!\" he cried.\n\nThe Thenardier woman hastened to him.\n\n\"Here's the letter. You know what you have to do. There is a carriage at\nthe door. Set out at once, and return ditto.\"\n\nAnd addressing the man with the meat-axe:--\n\n\"Since you have taken off your nose-screen, accompany the mistress. You\nwill get up behind the fiacre. You know where you left the team?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said the man.\n\nAnd depositing his axe in a corner, he followed Madame Thenardier.\n\nAs they set off, Thenardier thrust his head through the half-open door,\nand shouted into the corridor:--\n\n\"Above all things, don't lose the letter! remember that you carry two\nhundred thousand francs with you!\"\n\nThe Thenardier's hoarse voice replied:--\n\n\"Be easy. I have it in my bosom.\"\n\nA minute had not elapsed, when the sound of the cracking of a whip was\nheard, which rapidly retreated and died away.\n\n\"Good!\" growled Thenardier. \"They're going at a fine pace. At such a\ngallop, the bourgeoise will be back inside three-quarters of an hour.\"\n\nHe drew a chair close to the fireplace, folding his arms, and presenting\nhis muddy boots to the brazier.\n\n\"My feet are cold!\" said he.\n\nOnly five ruffians now remained in the den with Thenardier and the\nprisoner.\n\nThese men, through the black masks or paste which covered their faces,\nand made of them, at fear's pleasure, charcoal-burners, negroes, or\ndemons, had a stupid and gloomy air, and it could be felt that they\nperpetrated a crime like a bit of work, tranquilly, without either wrath\nor mercy, with a sort of ennui. They were crowded together in one corner\nlike brutes, and remained silent.\n\nThenardier warmed his feet.\n\nThe prisoner had relapsed into his taciturnity. A sombre calm had\nsucceeded to the wild uproar which had filled the garret but a few\nmoments before.\n\nThe candle, on which a large \"stranger\" had formed, cast but a dim\nlight in the immense hovel, the brazier had grown dull, and all those\nmonstrous heads cast misshapen shadows on the walls and ceiling.\n\nNo sound was audible except the quiet breathing of the old drunken man,\nwho was fast asleep.\n\nMarius waited in a state of anxiety that was augmented by every trifle.\nThe enigma was more impenetrable than ever.\n\nWho was this \"little one\" whom Thenardier had called the Lark? Was she\nhis \"Ursule\"? The prisoner had not seemed to be affected by that word,\n\"the Lark,\" and had replied in the most natural manner in the world:\n\"I do not know what you mean.\" On the other hand, the two letters U. F.\nwere explained; they meant Urbain Fabre; and Ursule was no longer named\nUrsule. This was what Marius perceived most clearly of all.\n\nA sort of horrible fascination held him nailed to his post, from which\nhe was observing and commanding this whole scene. There he stood,\nalmost incapable of movement or reflection, as though annihilated by the\nabominable things viewed at such close quarters. He waited, in the hope\nof some incident, no matter of what nature, since he could not collect\nhis thoughts and did not know upon what course to decide.\n\n\"In any case,\" he said, \"if she is the Lark, I shall see her, for the\nThenardier woman is to bring her hither. That will be the end, and then\nI will give my life and my blood if necessary, but I will deliver her!\nNothing shall stop me.\"\n\nNearly half an hour passed in this manner. Thenardier seemed to be\nabsorbed in gloomy reflections, the prisoner did not stir. Still, Marius\nfancied that at intervals, and for the last few moments, he had heard a\nfaint, dull noise in the direction of the prisoner.\n\nAll at once, Thenardier addressed the prisoner:\n\n\"By the way, Monsieur Fabre, I might as well say it to you at once.\"\n\nThese few words appeared to be the beginning of an explanation. Marius\nstrained his ears.\n\n\"My wife will be back shortly, don't get impatient. I think that the\nLark really is your daughter, and it seems to me quite natural that you\nshould keep her. Only, listen to me a bit. My wife will go and hunt her\nup with your letter. I told my wife to dress herself in the way she did,\nso that your young lady might make no difficulty about following her.\nThey will both enter the carriage with my comrade behind. Somewhere,\noutside the barrier, there is a trap harnessed to two very good horses.\nYour young lady will be taken to it. She will alight from the fiacre.\nMy comrade will enter the other vehicle with her, and my wife will come\nback here to tell us: 'It's done.' As for the young lady, no harm will\nbe done to her; the trap will conduct her to a place where she will be\nquiet, and just as soon as you have handed over to me those little two\nhundred thousand francs, she will be returned to you. If you have me\narrested, my comrade will give a turn of his thumb to the Lark, that's\nall.\"\n\nThe prisoner uttered not a syllable. After a pause, Thenardier\ncontinued:--\n\n\"It's very simple, as you see. There'll be no harm done unless you wish\nthat there should be harm done. I'm telling you how things stand. I warn\nyou so that you may be prepared.\"\n\nHe paused: the prisoner did not break the silence, and Thenardier\nresumed:--\n\n\"As soon as my wife returns and says to me: 'The Lark is on the way,' we\nwill release you, and you will be free to go and sleep at home. You see\nthat our intentions are not evil.\"\n\nTerrible images passed through Marius' mind. What! That young girl whom\nthey were abducting was not to be brought back? One of those monsters\nwas to bear her off into the darkness? Whither? And what if it were she!\n\nIt was clear that it was she. Marius felt his heart stop beating.\n\nWhat was he to do? Discharge the pistol? Place all those scoundrels in\nthe hands of justice? But the horrible man with the meat-axe would, none\nthe less, be out of reach with the young girl, and Marius reflected on\nThenardier's words, of which he perceived the bloody significance: \"If\nyou have me arrested, my comrade will give a turn of his thumb to the\nLark.\"\n\nNow, it was not alone by the colonel's testament, it was by his own\nlove, it was by the peril of the one he loved, that he felt himself\nrestrained.\n\nThis frightful situation, which had already lasted above half an hour,\nwas changing its aspect every moment.\n\nMarius had sufficient strength of mind to review in succession all the\nmost heart-breaking conjectures, seeking hope and finding none.\n\nThe tumult of his thoughts contrasted with the funereal silence of the\nden.\n\nIn the midst of this silence, the door at the bottom of the staircase\nwas heard to open and shut again.\n\nThe prisoner made a movement in his bonds.\n\n\"Here's the bourgeoise,\" said Thenardier.\n\nHe had hardly uttered the words, when the Thenardier woman did in fact\nrush hastily into the room, red, panting, breathless, with flaming eyes,\nand cried, as she smote her huge hands on her thighs simultaneously:--\n\n\"False address!\"\n\nThe ruffian who had gone with her made his appearance behind her and\npicked up his axe again.\n\nShe resumed:--\n\n\"Nobody there! Rue Saint-Dominique, No. 17, no Monsieur Urbain Fabre!\nThey know not what it means!\"\n\nShe paused, choking, then went on:--\n\n\"Monsieur Thenardier! That old fellow has duped you! You are too good,\nyou see! If it had been me, I'd have chopped the beast in four quarters\nto begin with! And if he had acted ugly, I'd have boiled him alive! He\nwould have been obliged to speak, and say where the girl is, and where\nhe keeps his shiners! That's the way I should have managed matters!\nPeople are perfectly right when they say that men are a deal stupider\nthan women! Nobody at No. 17. It's nothing but a big carriage gate! No\nMonsieur Fabre in the Rue Saint-Dominique! And after all that racing\nand fee to the coachman and all! I spoke to both the porter and the\nportress, a fine, stout woman, and they know nothing about him!\"\n\nMarius breathed freely once more.\n\nShe, Ursule or the Lark, he no longer knew what to call her, was safe.\n\nWhile his exasperated wife vociferated, Thenardier had seated himself on\nthe table.\n\nFor several minutes he uttered not a word, but swung his right foot,\nwhich hung down, and stared at the brazier with an air of savage revery.\n\nFinally, he said to the prisoner, with a slow and singularly ferocious\ntone:\n\n\"A false address? What did you expect to gain by that?\"\n\n\"To gain time!\" cried the prisoner in a thundering voice, and at the\nsame instant he shook off his bonds; they were cut. The prisoner was\nonly attached to the bed now by one leg.\n\nBefore the seven men had time to collect their senses and dash forward,\nhe had bent down into the fireplace, had stretched out his hand to the\nbrazier, and had then straightened himself up again, and now Thenardier,\nthe female Thenardier, and the ruffians, huddled in amazement at the\nextremity of the hovel, stared at him in stupefaction, as almost free\nand in a formidable attitude, he brandished above his head the red-hot\nchisel, which emitted a threatening glow.\n\nThe judicial examination to which the ambush in the Gorbeau house\neventually gave rise, established the fact that a large sou piece, cut\nand worked in a peculiar fashion, was found in the garret, when the\npolice made their descent on it. This sou piece was one of those marvels\nof industry, which are engendered by the patience of the galleys in\nthe shadows and for the shadows, marvels which are nothing else than\ninstruments of escape. These hideous and delicate products of wonderful\nart are to jewellers' work what the metaphors of slang are to poetry.\nThere are Benvenuto Cellinis in the galleys, just as there are Villons\nin language. The unhappy wretch who aspires to deliverance finds means\nsometimes without tools, sometimes with a common wooden-handled knife,\nto saw a sou into two thin plates, to hollow out these plates without\naffecting the coinage stamp, and to make a furrow on the edge of the sou\nin such a manner that the plates will adhere again. This can be screwed\ntogether and unscrewed at will; it is a box. In this box he hides a\nwatch-spring, and this watch-spring, properly handled, cuts good-sized\nchains and bars of iron. The unfortunate convict is supposed to possess\nmerely a sou; not at all, he possesses liberty. It was a large sou of\nthis sort which, during the subsequent search of the police, was found\nunder the bed near the window. They also found a tiny saw of blue steel\nwhich would fit the sou.\n\nIt is probable that the prisoner had this sou piece on his person at the\nmoment when the ruffians searched him, that he contrived to conceal\nit in his hand, and that afterward, having his right hand free, he\nunscrewed it, and used it as a saw to cut the cords which fastened him,\nwhich would explain the faint noise and almost imperceptible movements\nwhich Marius had observed.\n\nAs he had not been able to bend down, for fear of betraying himself, he\nhad not cut the bonds of his left leg.\n\nThe ruffians had recovered from their first surprise.\n\n\"Be easy,\" said Bigrenaille to Thenardier. \"He still holds by one leg,\nand he can't get away. I'll answer for that. I tied that paw for him.\"\n\nIn the meanwhile, the prisoner had begun to speak:--\n\n\"You are wretches, but my life is not worth the trouble of defending it.\nWhen you think that you can make me speak, that you can make me write\nwhat I do not choose to write, that you can make me say what I do not\nchoose to say--\"\n\nHe stripped up his left sleeve, and added:--\n\n\"See here.\"\n\nAt the same moment he extended his arm, and laid the glowing chisel\nwhich he held in his left hand by its wooden handle on his bare flesh.\n\nThe crackling of the burning flesh became audible, and the odor peculiar\nto chambers of torture filled the hovel.\n\n[Illustration: Red Hot Chisel  3b8-20-red-hot-chisel]\n\nMarius reeled in utter horror, the very ruffians shuddered, hardly a\nmuscle of the old man's face contracted, and while the red-hot iron\nsank into the smoking wound, impassive and almost august, he fixed on\nThenardier his beautiful glance, in which there was no hatred, and where\nsuffering vanished in serene majesty.\n\nWith grand and lofty natures, the revolts of the flesh and the senses\nwhen subjected to physical suffering cause the soul to spring forth, and\nmake it appear on the brow, just as rebellions among the soldiery force\nthe captain to show himself.\n\n\"Wretches!\" said he, \"have no more fear of me than I have for you!\"\n\nAnd, tearing the chisel from the wound, he hurled it through the window,\nwhich had been left open; the horrible, glowing tool disappeared into\nthe night, whirling as it flew, and fell far away on the snow.\n\nThe prisoner resumed:--\n\n\"Do what you please with me.\" He was disarmed.\n\n\"Seize him!\" said Thenardier.\n\nTwo of the ruffians laid their hands on his shoulder, and the masked\nman with the ventriloquist's voice took up his station in front of him,\nready to smash his skull at the slightest movement.\n\nAt the same time, Marius heard below him, at the base of the partition,\nbut so near that he could not see who was speaking, this colloquy\nconducted in a low tone:--\n\n\"There is only one thing left to do.\"\n\n\"Cut his throat.\"\n\n\"That's it.\"\n\nIt was the husband and wife taking counsel together.\n\nThenardier walked slowly towards the table, opened the drawer, and\ntook out the knife. Marius fretted with the handle of his pistol.\nUnprecedented perplexity! For the last hour he had had two voices in his\nconscience, the one enjoining him to respect his father's testament, the\nother crying to him to rescue the prisoner. These two voices continued\nuninterruptedly that struggle which tormented him to agony. Up to that\nmoment he had cherished a vague hope that he should find some means\nof reconciling these two duties, but nothing within the limits of\npossibility had presented itself.\n\nHowever, the peril was urgent, the last bounds of delay had been\nreached; Thenardier was standing thoughtfully a few paces distant from\nthe prisoner.\n\nMarius cast a wild glance about him, the last mechanical resource of\ndespair. All at once a shudder ran through him.\n\nAt his feet, on the table, a bright ray of light from the full moon\nilluminated and seemed to point out to him a sheet of paper. On this\npaper he read the following line written that very morning, in large\nletters, by the eldest of the Thenardier girls:--\n\n\"THE BOBBIES ARE HERE.\"\n\nAn idea, a flash, crossed Marius' mind; this was the expedient of which\nhe was in search, the solution of that frightful problem which was\ntorturing him, of sparing the assassin and saving the victim.\n\nHe knelt down on his commode, stretched out his arm, seized the sheet of\npaper, softly detached a bit of plaster from the wall, wrapped the paper\nround it, and tossed the whole through the crevice into the middle of\nthe den.\n\nIt was high time. Thenardier had conquered his last fears or his last\nscruples, and was advancing on the prisoner.\n\n\"Something is falling!\" cried the Thenardier woman.\n\n\"What is it?\" asked her husband.\n\nThe woman darted forward and picked up the bit of plaster. She handed it\nto her husband.\n\n\"Where did this come from?\" demanded Thenardier.\n\n\"Pardie!\" ejaculated his wife, \"where do you suppose it came from?\nThrough the window, of course.\"\n\n\"I saw it pass,\" said Bigrenaille.\n\nThenardier rapidly unfolded the paper and held it close to the candle.\n\n\"It's in Eponine's handwriting. The devil!\"\n\nHe made a sign to his wife, who hastily drew near, and showed her the\nline written on the sheet of paper, then he added in a subdued voice:--\n\n\"Quick! The ladder! Let's leave the bacon in the mousetrap and decamp!\"\n\n\"Without cutting that man's throat?\" asked, the Thenardier woman.\n\n\"We haven't the time.\"\n\n\"Through what?\" resumed Bigrenaille.\n\n\"Through the window,\" replied Thenardier. \"Since Ponine has thrown the\nstone through the window, it indicates that the house is not watched on\nthat side.\"\n\nThe mask with the ventriloquist's voice deposited his huge key on the\nfloor, raised both arms in the air, and opened and clenched his fists,\nthree times rapidly without uttering a word.\n\nThis was the signal like the signal for clearing the decks for action on\nboard ship.\n\nThe ruffians who were holding the prisoner released him; in the\ntwinkling of an eye the rope ladder was unrolled outside the window, and\nsolidly fastened to the sill by the two iron hooks.\n\nThe prisoner paid no attention to what was going on around him. He\nseemed to be dreaming or praying.\n\nAs soon as the ladder was arranged, Thenardier cried:\n\n\"Come! the bourgeoise first!\"\n\nAnd he rushed headlong to the window.\n\nBut just as he was about to throw his leg over, Bigrenaille seized him\nroughly by the collar.\n\n\"Not much, come now, you old dog, after us!\"\n\n\"After us!\" yelled the ruffians.\n\n\"You are children,\" said Thenardier, \"we are losing time. The police are\non our heels.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said the ruffians, \"let's draw lots to see who shall go down\nfirst.\"\n\nThenardier exclaimed:--\n\n\"Are you mad! Are you crazy! What a pack of boobies! You want to waste\ntime, do you? Draw lots, do you? By a wet finger, by a short straw! With\nwritten names! Thrown into a hat!--\"\n\n\"Would you like my hat?\" cried a voice on the threshold.\n\nAll wheeled round. It was Javert.\n\nHe had his hat in his hand, and was holding it out to them with a smile.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXI--ONE SHOULD ALWAYS BEGIN BY ARRESTING THE VICTIMS\n\nAt nightfall, Javert had posted his men and had gone into ambush himself\nbetween the trees of the Rue de la Barrieredes-Gobelins which faced\nthe Gorbeau house, on the other side of the boulevard. He had begun\noperations by opening \"his pockets,\" and dropping into it the two young\ngirls who were charged with keeping a watch on the approaches to the\nden. But he had only \"caged\" Azelma. As for Eponine, she was not at her\npost, she had disappeared, and he had not been able to seize her. Then\nJavert had made a point and had bent his ear to waiting for the signal\nagreed upon. The comings and goings of the fiacres had greatly agitated\nhim. At last, he had grown impatient, and, sure that there was a nest\nthere, sure of being in \"luck,\" having recognized many of the ruffians\nwho had entered, he had finally decided to go upstairs without waiting\nfor the pistol-shot.\n\nIt will be remembered that he had Marius' pass-key.\n\nHe had arrived just in the nick of time.\n\nThe terrified ruffians flung themselves on the arms which they had\nabandoned in all the corners at the moment of flight. In less than a\nsecond, these seven men, horrible to behold, had grouped themselves in\nan attitude of defence, one with his meat-axe, another with his key,\nanother with his bludgeon, the rest with shears, pincers, and hammers.\nThenardier had his knife in his fist. The Thenardier woman snatched up\nan enormous paving-stone which lay in the angle of the window and served\nher daughters as an ottoman.\n\n[Illustration: Snatched up a Paving Stone  3b8-21-paving-stone]\n\nJavert put on his hat again, and advanced a couple of paces into the\nroom, with arms folded, his cane under one arm, his sword in its sheath.\n\n\"Halt there,\" said he. \"You shall not go out by the window, you shall go\nthrough the door. It's less unhealthy. There are seven of you, there\nare fifteen of us. Don't let's fall to collaring each other like men of\nAuvergne.\"\n\nBigrenaille drew out a pistol which he had kept concealed under his\nblouse, and put it in Thenardier's hand, whispering in the latter's\near:--\n\n\"It's Javert. I don't dare fire at that man. Do you dare?\"\n\n\"Parbleu!\" replied Thenardier.\n\n\"Well, then, fire.\"\n\nThenardier took the pistol and aimed at Javert.\n\nJavert, who was only three paces from him, stared intently at him and\ncontented himself with saying:--\n\n\"Come now, don't fire. You'll miss fire.\"\n\nThenardier pulled the trigger. The pistol missed fire.\n\n\"Didn't I tell you so!\" ejaculated Javert.\n\nBigrenaille flung his bludgeon at Javert's feet.\n\n\"You're the emperor of the fiends! I surrender.\"\n\n\"And you?\" Javert asked the rest of the ruffians.\n\nThey replied:--\n\n\"So do we.\"\n\nJavert began again calmly:--\n\n\"That's right, that's good, I said so, you are nice fellows.\"\n\n\"I only ask one thing,\" said Bigrenaille, \"and that is, that I may not\nbe denied tobacco while I am in confinement.\"\n\n\"Granted,\" said Javert.\n\nAnd turning round and calling behind him:--\n\n\"Come in now!\"\n\nA squad of policemen, sword in hand, and agents armed with bludgeons and\ncudgels, rushed in at Javert's summons. They pinioned the ruffians.\n\nThis throng of men, sparely lighted by the single candle, filled the den\nwith shadows.\n\n\"Handcuff them all!\" shouted Javert.\n\n\"Come on!\" cried a voice which was not the voice of a man, but of which\nno one would ever have said: \"It is a woman's voice.\"\n\nThe Thenardier woman had entrenched herself in one of the angles of the\nwindow, and it was she who had just given vent to this roar.\n\nThe policemen and agents recoiled.\n\nShe had thrown off her shawl, but retained her bonnet; her husband, who\nwas crouching behind her, was almost hidden under the discarded\nshawl, and she was shielding him with her body, as she elevated the\npaving-stone above her head with the gesture of a giantess on the point\nof hurling a rock.\n\n\"Beware!\" she shouted.\n\nAll crowded back towards the corridor. A broad open space was cleared in\nthe middle of the garret.\n\nThe Thenardier woman cast a glance at the ruffians who had allowed\nthemselves to be pinioned, and muttered in hoarse and guttural\naccents:--\n\n\"The cowards!\"\n\nJavert smiled, and advanced across the open space which the Thenardier\nwas devouring with her eyes.\n\n\"Don't come near me,\" she cried, \"or I'll crush you.\"\n\n\"What a grenadier!\" ejaculated Javert; \"you've got a beard like a man,\nmother, but I have claws like a woman.\"\n\nAnd he continued to advance.\n\nThe Thenardier, dishevelled and terrible, set her feet far apart, threw\nherself backwards, and hurled the paving-stone at Javert's head. Javert\nducked, the stone passed over him, struck the wall behind, knocked off a\nhuge piece of plastering, and, rebounding from angle to angle across the\nhovel, now luckily almost empty, rested at Javert's feet.\n\nAt the same moment, Javert reached the Thenardier couple. One of his\nbig hands descended on the woman's shoulder; the other on the husband's\nhead.\n\n\"The handcuffs!\" he shouted.\n\nThe policemen trooped in in force, and in a few seconds Javert's order\nhad been executed.\n\nThe Thenardier female, overwhelmed, stared at her pinioned hands, and\nat those of her husband, who had dropped to the floor, and exclaimed,\nweeping:--\n\n\"My daughters!\"\n\n\"They are in the jug,\" said Javert.\n\nIn the meanwhile, the agents had caught sight of the drunken man asleep\nbehind the door, and were shaking him:--\n\nHe awoke, stammering:--\n\n\"Is it all over, Jondrette?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" replied Javert.\n\nThe six pinioned ruffians were standing, and still preserved their\nspectral mien; all three besmeared with black, all three masked.\n\n\"Keep on your masks,\" said Javert.\n\nAnd passing them in review with a glance of a Frederick II. at a Potsdam\nparade, he said to the three \"chimney-builders\":--\n\n\"Good day, Bigrenaille! good day, Brujon! good day, Deuxmilliards!\"\n\nThen turning to the three masked men, he said to the man with the\nmeat-axe:--\n\n\"Good day, Gueulemer!\"\n\nAnd to the man with the cudgel:--\n\n\"Good day, Babet!\"\n\nAnd to the ventriloquist:--\n\n\"Your health, Claquesous.\"\n\nAt that moment, he caught sight of the ruffians' prisoner, who, ever\nsince the entrance of the police, had not uttered a word, and had held\nhis head down.\n\n\"Untie the gentleman!\" said Javert, \"and let no one go out!\"\n\nThat said, he seated himself with sovereign dignity before the table,\nwhere the candle and the writing-materials still remained, drew a\nstamped paper from his pocket, and began to prepare his report.\n\nWhen he had written the first lines, which are formulas that never vary,\nhe raised his eyes:--\n\n\"Let the gentleman whom these gentlemen bound step forward.\"\n\nThe policemen glanced round them.\n\n\"Well,\" said Javert, \"where is he?\"\n\nThe prisoner of the ruffians, M. Leblanc, M. Urbain Fabre, the father of\nUrsule or the Lark, had disappeared.\n\nThe door was guarded, but the window was not. As soon as he had found\nhimself released from his bonds, and while Javert was drawing up his\nreport, he had taken advantage of confusion, the crowd, the darkness,\nand of a moment when the general attention was diverted from him, to\ndash out of the window.\n\nAn agent sprang to the opening and looked out. He saw no one outside.\n\nThe rope ladder was still shaking.\n\n\"The devil!\" ejaculated Javert between his teeth, \"he must have been the\nmost valuable of the lot.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXII--THE LITTLE ONE WHO WAS CRYING IN VOLUME TWO\n\nOn the day following that on which these events took place in the house\non the Boulevard de l'Hopital, a child, who seemed to be coming from the\ndirection of the bridge of Austerlitz, was ascending the side-alley on\nthe right in the direction of the Barriere de Fontainebleau.\n\nNight had fully come.\n\nThis lad was pale, thin, clad in rags, with linen trousers in the month\nof February, and was singing at the top of his voice.\n\nAt the corner of the Rue du Petit-Banquier, a bent old woman was\nrummaging in a heap of refuse by the light of a street lantern; the\nchild jostled her as he passed, then recoiled, exclaiming:--\n\n\"Hello! And I took it for an enormous, enormous dog!\"\n\nHe pronounced the word enormous the second time with a jeering swell\nof the voice which might be tolerably well represented by capitals: \"an\nenormous, ENORMOUS dog.\"\n\nThe old woman straightened herself up in a fury.\n\n\"Nasty brat!\" she grumbled. \"If I hadn't been bending over, I know well\nwhere I would have planted my foot on you.\"\n\nThe boy was already far away.\n\n\"Kisss! kisss!\" he cried. \"After that, I don't think I was mistaken!\"\n\nThe old woman, choking with indignation, now rose completely upright,\nand the red gleam of the lantern fully lighted up her livid face, all\nhollowed into angles and wrinkles, with crow's-feet meeting the corners\nof her mouth.\n\nHer body was lost in the darkness, and only her head was visible. One\nwould have pronounced her a mask of Decrepitude carved out by a light\nfrom the night.\n\nThe boy surveyed her.\n\n\"Madame,\" said he, \"does not possess that style of beauty which pleases\nme.\"\n\nHe then pursued his road, and resumed his song:--\n\n               \"Le roi Coupdesabot\n               S'en allait a la chasse,\n               A la chasse aux corbeaux--\"\n\n\nAt the end of these three lines he paused. He had arrived in front of\nNo. 50-52, and finding the door fastened, he began to assault it with\nresounding and heroic kicks, which betrayed rather the man's shoes that\nhe was wearing than the child's feet which he owned.\n\nIn the meanwhile, the very old woman whom he had encountered at the\ncorner of the Rue du Petit-Banquier hastened up behind him, uttering\nclamorous cries and indulging in lavish and exaggerated gestures.\n\n\"What's this? What's this? Lord God! He's battering the door down! He's\nknocking the house down.\"\n\nThe kicks continued.\n\nThe old woman strained her lungs.\n\n\"Is that the way buildings are treated nowadays?\"\n\nAll at once she paused.\n\nShe had recognized the gamin.\n\n\"What! so it's that imp!\"\n\n\"Why, it's the old lady,\" said the lad. \"Good day, Bougonmuche. I have\ncome to see my ancestors.\"\n\nThe old woman retorted with a composite grimace, and a wonderful\nimprovisation of hatred taking advantage of feebleness and ugliness,\nwhich was, unfortunately, wasted in the dark:--\n\n\"There's no one here.\"\n\n\"Bah!\" retorted the boy, \"where's my father?\"\n\n\"At La Force.\"\n\n\"Come, now! And my mother?\"\n\n\"At Saint-Lazare.\"\n\n\"Well! And my sisters?\"\n\n\"At the Madelonettes.\"\n\nThe lad scratched his head behind his ear, stared at Ma'am Bougon, and\nsaid:--\n\n\"Ah!\"\n\nThen he executed a pirouette on his heel; a moment later, the old woman,\nwho had remained on the door-step, heard him singing in his clear, young\nvoice, as he plunged under the black elm-trees, in the wintry wind:--\n\n               \"Le roi Coupdesabot[31]\n               S'en allait a la chasse,\n               A la chasse aux corbeaux,\n               Monte sur deux echasses.\n               Quand on passait dessous,\n               On lui payait deux sous.\"\n\n\n[THE END OF VOLUME III. \"MARIUS\"]\n\n\n\n\n\nVOLUME IV.--SAINT-DENIS.\n\n[Illustration: Frontispiece Volume Four]\n\n[Illustration: Titlepage Volume Four]\n\n\nTHE IDYL IN THE RUE PLUMET AND THE EPIC IN THE RUE SAINT-DENIS\n\n\n\n\nBOOK FIRST.--A FEW PAGES OF HISTORY\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I--WELL CUT\n\n1831 and 1832, the two years which are immediately connected with the\nRevolution of July, form one of the most peculiar and striking moments\nof history. These two years rise like two mountains midway between those\nwhich precede and those which follow them. They have a revolutionary\ngrandeur. Precipices are to be distinguished there. The social masses,\nthe very assizes of civilization, the solid group of superposed and\nadhering interests, the century-old profiles of the ancient French\nformation, appear and disappear in them every instant, athwart the storm\nclouds of systems, of passions, and of theories. These appearances\nand disappearances have been designated as movement and resistance.\nAt intervals, truth, that daylight of the human soul, can be descried\nshining there.\n\nThis remarkable epoch is decidedly circumscribed and is beginning to\nbe sufficiently distant from us to allow of our grasping the principal\nlines even at the present day.\n\nWe shall make the attempt.\n\nThe Restoration had been one of those intermediate phases, hard to\ndefine, in which there is fatigue, buzzing, murmurs, sleep, tumult,\nand which are nothing else than the arrival of a great nation at a\nhalting-place.\n\nThese epochs are peculiar and mislead the politicians who desire to\nconvert them to profit. In the beginning, the nation asks nothing but\nrepose; it thirsts for but one thing, peace; it has but one ambition,\nto be small. Which is the translation of remaining tranquil. Of great\nevents, great hazards, great adventures, great men, thank God, we\nhave seen enough, we have them heaped higher than our heads. We would\nexchange Caesar for Prusias, and Napoleon for the King of Yvetot. \"What\na good little king was he!\" We have marched since daybreak, we have\nreached the evening of a long and toilsome day; we have made our first\nchange with Mirabeau, the second with Robespierre, the third with\nBonaparte; we are worn out. Each one demands a bed.\n\nDevotion which is weary, heroism which has grown old, ambitions which\nare sated, fortunes which are made, seek, demand, implore, solicit,\nwhat? A shelter. They have it. They take possession of peace, of\ntranquillity, of leisure; behold, they are content. But, at the same\ntime certain facts arise, compel recognition, and knock at the door in\ntheir turn. These facts are the products of revolutions and wars, they\nare, they exist, they have the right to install themselves in society,\nand they do install themselves therein; and most of the time, facts\nare the stewards of the household and fouriers[32] who do nothing but\nprepare lodgings for principles.\n\nThis, then, is what appears to philosophical politicians:--\n\nAt the same time that weary men demand repose, accomplished facts demand\nguarantees. Guarantees are the same to facts that repose is to men.\n\nThis is what England demanded of the Stuarts after the Protector; this\nis what France demanded of the Bourbons after the Empire.\n\nThese guarantees are a necessity of the times. They must be accorded.\nPrinces \"grant\" them, but in reality, it is the force of things which\ngives them. A profound truth, and one useful to know, which the Stuarts\ndid not suspect in 1662 and which the Bourbons did not even obtain a\nglimpse of in 1814.\n\nThe predestined family, which returned to France when Napoleon fell, had\nthe fatal simplicity to believe that it was itself which bestowed, and\nthat what it had bestowed it could take back again; that the House of\nBourbon possessed the right divine, that France possessed nothing, and\nthat the political right conceded in the charter of Louis XVIII. was\nmerely a branch of the right divine, was detached by the House of\nBourbon and graciously given to the people until such day as it should\nplease the King to reassume it. Still, the House of Bourbon should have\nfelt, from the displeasure created by the gift, that it did not come\nfrom it.\n\nThis house was churlish to the nineteenth century. It put on an\nill-tempered look at every development of the nation. To make use of a\ntrivial word, that is to say, of a popular and a true word, it looked\nglum. The people saw this.\n\nIt thought it possessed strength because the Empire had been carried\naway before it like a theatrical stage-setting. It did not perceive that\nit had, itself, been brought in in the same fashion. It did not perceive\nthat it also lay in that hand which had removed Napoleon.\n\nIt thought that it had roots, because it was the past. It was mistaken;\nit formed a part of the past, but the whole past was France. The roots\nof French society were not fixed in the Bourbons, but in the nations.\nThese obscure and lively roots constituted, not the right of a family,\nbut the history of a people. They were everywhere, except under the\nthrone.\n\nThe House of Bourbon was to France the illustrious and bleeding knot in\nher history, but was no longer the principal element of her destiny,\nand the necessary base of her politics. She could get along without the\nBourbons; she had done without them for two and twenty years; there\nhad been a break of continuity; they did not suspect the fact. And how\nshould they have suspected it, they who fancied that Louis XVII. reigned\non the 9th of Thermidor, and that Louis XVIII. was reigning at the\nbattle of Marengo? Never, since the origin of history, had princes been\nso blind in the presence of facts and the portion of divine authority\nwhich facts contain and promulgate. Never had that pretension here below\nwhich is called the right of kings denied to such a point the right from\non high.\n\nA capital error which led this family to lay its hand once more on the\nguarantees \"granted\" in 1814, on the concessions, as it termed them.\nSad. A sad thing! What it termed its concessions were our conquests;\nwhat it termed our encroachments were our rights.\n\nWhen the hour seemed to it to have come, the Restoration, supposing\nitself victorious over Bonaparte and well-rooted in the country, that is\nto say, believing itself to be strong and deep, abruptly decided on its\nplan of action, and risked its stroke. One morning it drew itself up\nbefore the face of France, and, elevating its voice, it contested the\ncollective title and the individual right of the nation to sovereignty,\nof the citizen to liberty. In other words, it denied to the nation\nthat which made it a nation, and to the citizen that which made him a\ncitizen.\n\nThis is the foundation of those famous acts which are called the\nordinances of July. The Restoration fell.\n\nIt fell justly. But, we admit, it had not been absolutely hostile to\nall forms of progress. Great things had been accomplished, with it\nalongside.\n\nUnder the Restoration, the nation had grown accustomed to calm\ndiscussion, which had been lacking under the Republic, and to grandeur\nin peace, which had been wanting under the Empire. France free and\nstrong had offered an encouraging spectacle to the other peoples of\nEurope. The Revolution had had the word under Robespierre; the cannon\nhad had the word under Bonaparte; it was under Louis XVIII. and Charles\nX. that it was the turn of intelligence to have the word. The wind\nceased, the torch was lighted once more. On the lofty heights, the\npure light of mind could be seen flickering. A magnificent, useful, and\ncharming spectacle. For a space of fifteen years, those great principles\nwhich are so old for the thinker, so new for the statesman, could be\nseen at work in perfect peace, on the public square; equality before the\nlaw, liberty of conscience, liberty of speech, liberty of the press, the\naccessibility of all aptitudes to all functions. Thus it proceeded until\n1830. The Bourbons were an instrument of civilization which broke in the\nhands of Providence.\n\nThe fall of the Bourbons was full of grandeur, not on their side, but\non the side of the nation. They quitted the throne with gravity, but\nwithout authority; their descent into the night was not one of those\nsolemn disappearances which leave a sombre emotion in history; it\nwas neither the spectral calm of Charles I., nor the eagle scream of\nNapoleon. They departed, that is all. They laid down the crown, and\nretained no aureole. They were worthy, but they were not august. They\nlacked, in a certain measure, the majesty of their misfortune. Charles\nX. during the voyage from Cherbourg, causing a round table to be cut\nover into a square table, appeared to be more anxious about imperilled\netiquette than about the crumbling monarchy. This diminution saddened\ndevoted men who loved their persons, and serious men who honored their\nrace. The populace was admirable. The nation, attacked one morning with\nweapons, by a sort of royal insurrection, felt itself in the possession\nof so much force that it did not go into a rage. It defended itself,\nrestrained itself, restored things to their places, the government to\nlaw, the Bourbons to exile, alas! and then halted! It took the old king\nCharles X. from beneath that dais which had sheltered Louis XIV. and\nset him gently on the ground. It touched the royal personages only with\nsadness and precaution. It was not one man, it was not a few men, it\nwas France, France entire, France victorious and intoxicated with her\nvictory, who seemed to be coming to herself, and who put into practice,\nbefore the eyes of the whole world, these grave words of Guillaume du\nVair after the day of the Barricades:--\n\n\"It is easy for those who are accustomed to skim the favors of the\ngreat, and to spring, like a bird from bough to bough, from an afflicted\nfortune to a flourishing one, to show themselves harsh towards their\nPrince in his adversity; but as for me, the fortune of my Kings and\nespecially of my afflicted Kings, will always be venerable to me.\"\n\nThe Bourbons carried away with them respect, but not regret. As we have\njust stated, their misfortune was greater than they were. They faded out\nin the horizon.\n\nThe Revolution of July instantly had friends and enemies throughout the\nentire world. The first rushed toward her with joy and enthusiasm, the\nothers turned away, each according to his nature. At the first blush,\nthe princes of Europe, the owls of this dawn, shut their eyes, wounded\nand stupefied, and only opened them to threaten. A fright which can be\ncomprehended, a wrath which can be pardoned. This strange revolution had\nhardly produced a shock; it had not even paid to vanquished royalty the\nhonor of treating it as an enemy, and of shedding its blood. In the eyes\nof despotic governments, who are always interested in having liberty\ncalumniate itself, the Revolution of July committed the fault of being\nformidable and of remaining gentle. Nothing, however, was attempted or\nplotted against it. The most discontented, the most irritated, the most\ntrembling, saluted it; whatever our egotism and our rancor may be, a\nmysterious respect springs from events in which we are sensible of the\ncollaboration of some one who is working above man.\n\nThe Revolution of July is the triumph of right overthrowing the fact. A\nthing which is full of splendor.\n\nRight overthrowing the fact. Hence the brilliancy of the Revolution of\n1830, hence, also, its mildness. Right triumphant has no need of being\nviolent.\n\nRight is the just and the true.\n\nThe property of right is to remain eternally beautiful and pure. The\nfact, even when most necessary to all appearances, even when most\nthoroughly accepted by contemporaries, if it exist only as a fact, and\nif it contain only too little of right, or none at all, is infallibly\ndestined to become, in the course of time, deformed, impure, perhaps,\neven monstrous. If one desires to learn at one blow, to what degree of\nhideousness the fact can attain, viewed at the distance of centuries,\nlet him look at Machiavelli. Machiavelli is not an evil genius, nor a\ndemon, nor a miserable and cowardly writer; he is nothing but the fact.\nAnd he is not only the Italian fact; he is the European fact, the\nfact of the sixteenth century. He seems hideous, and so he is, in the\npresence of the moral idea of the nineteenth.\n\nThis conflict of right and fact has been going on ever since the origin\nof society. To terminate this duel, to amalgamate the pure idea with the\nhumane reality, to cause right to penetrate pacifically into the fact\nand the fact into right, that is the task of sages.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II--BADLY SEWED\n\nBut the task of sages is one thing, the task of clever men is another.\nThe Revolution of 1830 came to a sudden halt.\n\nAs soon as a revolution has made the coast, the skilful make haste to\nprepare the shipwreck.\n\nThe skilful in our century have conferred on themselves the title of\nStatesmen; so that this word, statesmen, has ended by becoming somewhat\nof a slang word. It must be borne in mind, in fact, that wherever\nthere is nothing but skill, there is necessarily pettiness. To say \"the\nskilful\" amounts to saying \"the mediocre.\"\n\nIn the same way, to say \"statesmen\" is sometimes equivalent to saying\n\"traitors.\" If, then, we are to believe the skilful, revolutions like\nthe Revolution of July are severed arteries; a prompt ligature is\nindispensable. The right, too grandly proclaimed, is shaken. Also, right\nonce firmly fixed, the state must be strengthened. Liberty once assured,\nattention must be directed to power.\n\nHere the sages are not, as yet, separated from the skilful, but they\nbegin to be distrustful. Power, very good. But, in the first place, what\nis power? In the second, whence comes it? The skilful do not seem to\nhear the murmured objection, and they continue their manoeuvres.\n\nAccording to the politicians, who are ingenious in putting the mask\nof necessity on profitable fictions, the first requirement of a people\nafter a revolution, when this people forms part of a monarchical\ncontinent, is to procure for itself a dynasty. In this way, say they,\npeace, that is to say, time to dress our wounds, and to repair\nthe house, can be had after a revolution. The dynasty conceals the\nscaffolding and covers the ambulance. Now, it is not always easy to\nprocure a dynasty.\n\nIf it is absolutely necessary, the first man of genius or even the first\nman of fortune who comes to hand suffices for the manufacturing of a\nking. You have, in the first case, Napoleon; in the second, Iturbide.\n\nBut the first family that comes to hand does not suffice to make a\ndynasty. There is necessarily required a certain modicum of antiquity in\na race, and the wrinkle of the centuries cannot be improvised.\n\nIf we place ourselves at the point of view of the \"statesmen,\" after\nmaking all allowances, of course, after a revolution, what are the\nqualities of the king which result from it? He may be and it is useful\nfor him to be a revolutionary; that is to say, a participant in his own\nperson in that revolution, that he should have lent a hand to it, that\nhe should have either compromised or distinguished himself therein, that\nhe should have touched the axe or wielded the sword in it.\n\nWhat are the qualities of a dynasty? It should be national; that is to\nsay, revolutionary at a distance, not through acts committed, but by\nreason of ideas accepted. It should be composed of past and be historic;\nbe composed of future and be sympathetic.\n\nAll this explains why the early revolutions contented themselves with\nfinding a man, Cromwell or Napoleon; and why the second absolutely\ninsisted on finding a family, the House of Brunswick or the House of\nOrleans.\n\nRoyal houses resemble those Indian fig-trees, each branch of which,\nbending over to the earth, takes root and becomes a fig-tree itself.\nEach branch may become a dynasty. On the sole condition that it shall\nbend down to the people.\n\nSuch is the theory of the skilful.\n\nHere, then, lies the great art: to make a little render to success the\nsound of a catastrophe in order that those who profit by it may tremble\nfrom it also, to season with fear every step that is taken, to augment\nthe curve of the transition to the point of retarding progress, to dull\nthat aurora, to denounce and retrench the harshness of enthusiasm, to\ncut all angles and nails, to wad triumph, to muffle up right, to envelop\nthe giant-people in flannel, and to put it to bed very speedily, to\nimpose a diet on that excess of health, to put Hercules on the treatment\nof a convalescent, to dilute the event with the expedient, to offer to\nspirits thirsting for the ideal that nectar thinned out with a potion,\nto take one's precautions against too much success, to garnish the\nrevolution with a shade.\n\n1830 practised this theory, already applied to England by 1688.\n\n1830 is a revolution arrested midway. Half of progress, quasi-right.\nNow, logic knows not the \"almost,\" absolutely as the sun knows not the\ncandle.\n\nWho arrests revolutions half-way? The bourgeoisie?\n\nWhy?\n\nBecause the bourgeoisie is interest which has reached satisfaction.\nYesterday it was appetite, to-day it is plenitude, to-morrow it will be\nsatiety.\n\nThe phenomenon of 1814 after Napoleon was reproduced in 1830 after\nCharles X.\n\nThe attempt has been made, and wrongly, to make a class of the\nbourgeoisie. The bourgeoisie is simply the contented portion of the\npeople. The bourgeois is the man who now has time to sit down. A chair\nis not a caste.\n\nBut through a desire to sit down too soon, one may arrest the very march\nof the human race. This has often been the fault of the bourgeoisie.\n\nOne is not a class because one has committed a fault. Selfishness is not\none of the divisions of the social order.\n\nMoreover, we must be just to selfishness. The state to which that part\nof the nation which is called the bourgeoisie aspired after the shock\nof 1830 was not the inertia which is complicated with indifference and\nlaziness, and which contains a little shame; it was not the slumber\nwhich presupposes a momentary forgetfulness accessible to dreams; it was\nthe halt.\n\nThe halt is a word formed of a singular double and almost contradictory\nsense: a troop on the march, that is to say, movement; a stand, that is\nto say, repose.\n\nThe halt is the restoration of forces; it is repose armed and on the\nalert; it is the accomplished fact which posts sentinels and holds\nitself on its guard.\n\nThe halt presupposes the combat of yesterday and the combat of\nto-morrow.\n\nIt is the partition between 1830 and 1848.\n\nWhat we here call combat may also be designated as progress.\n\nThe bourgeoisie then, as well as the statesmen, required a man who\nshould express this word Halt. An Although-Because. A composite\nindividuality, signifying revolution and signifying stability, in other\nterms, strengthening the present by the evident compatibility of the\npast with the future.\n\nThis man was \"already found.\" His name was Louis Philippe d'Orleans.\n\nThe 221 made Louis Philippe King. Lafayette undertook the coronation.\n\nHe called it the best of republics. The town-hall of Paris took the\nplace of the Cathedral of Rheims.\n\nThis substitution of a half-throne for a whole throne was \"the work of\n1830.\"\n\nWhen the skilful had finished, the immense vice of their solution became\napparent. All this had been accomplished outside the bounds of absolute\nright. Absolute right cried: \"I protest!\" then, terrible to say, it\nretired into the darkness.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III--LOUIS PHILIPPE\n\nRevolutions have a terrible arm and a happy hand, they strike firmly and\nchoose well. Even incomplete, even debased and abused and reduced to the\nstate of a junior revolution like the Revolution of 1830, they nearly\nalways retain sufficient providential lucidity to prevent them from\nfalling amiss. Their eclipse is never an abdication.\n\nNevertheless, let us not boast too loudly; revolutions also may be\ndeceived, and grave errors have been seen.\n\nLet us return to 1830. 1830, in its deviation, had good luck. In the\nestablishment which entitled itself order after the revolution had been\ncut short, the King amounted to more than royalty. Louis Philippe was a\nrare man.\n\nThe son of a father to whom history will accord certain attenuating\ncircumstances, but also as worthy of esteem as that father had been of\nblame; possessing all private virtues and many public virtues; careful\nof his health, of his fortune, of his person, of his affairs, knowing\nthe value of a minute and not always the value of a year; sober, serene,\npeaceable, patient; a good man and a good prince; sleeping with his\nwife, and having in his palace lackeys charged with the duty of showing\nthe conjugal bed to the bourgeois, an ostentation of the regular\nsleeping-apartment which had become useful after the former illegitimate\ndisplays of the elder branch; knowing all the languages of Europe, and,\nwhat is more rare, all the languages of all interests, and speaking\nthem; an admirable representative of the \"middle class,\" but\noutstripping it, and in every way greater than it; possessing excellent\nsense, while appreciating the blood from which he had sprung, counting\nmost of all on his intrinsic worth, and, on the question of his race,\nvery particular, declaring himself Orleans and not Bourbon; thoroughly\nthe first Prince of the Blood Royal while he was still only a Serene\nHighness, but a frank bourgeois from the day he became king; diffuse in\npublic, concise in private; reputed, but not proved to be a miser; at\nbottom, one of those economists who are readily prodigal at their own\nfancy or duty; lettered, but not very sensitive to letters; a gentleman,\nbut not a chevalier; simple, calm, and strong; adored by his family and\nhis household; a fascinating talker, an undeceived statesman, inwardly\ncold, dominated by immediate interest, always governing at the shortest\nrange, incapable of rancor and of gratitude, making use without mercy of\nsuperiority on mediocrity, clever in getting parliamentary majorities to\nput in the wrong those mysterious unanimities which mutter dully under\nthrones; unreserved, sometimes imprudent in his lack of reserve, but\nwith marvellous address in that imprudence; fertile in expedients, in\ncountenances, in masks; making France fear Europe and Europe France!\nIncontestably fond of his country, but preferring his family; assuming\nmore domination than authority and more authority than dignity, a\ndisposition which has this unfortunate property, that as it turns\neverything to success, it admits of ruse and does not absolutely\nrepudiate baseness, but which has this valuable side, that it preserves\npolitics from violent shocks, the state from fractures, and society\nfrom catastrophes; minute, correct, vigilant, attentive, sagacious,\nindefatigable; contradicting himself at times and giving himself the\nlie; bold against Austria at Ancona, obstinate against England in Spain,\nbombarding Antwerp, and paying off Pritchard; singing the Marseillaise\nwith conviction, inaccessible to despondency, to lassitude, to the taste\nfor the beautiful and the ideal, to daring generosity, to Utopia, to\nchimeras, to wrath, to vanity, to fear; possessing all the forms\nof personal intrepidity; a general at Valmy; a soldier at Jemappes;\nattacked eight times by regicides and always smiling. Brave as a\ngrenadier, courageous as a thinker; uneasy only in the face of the\nchances of a European shaking up, and unfitted for great political\nadventures; always ready to risk his life, never his work; disguising\nhis will in influence, in order that he might be obeyed as an\nintelligence rather than as a king; endowed with observation and not\nwith divination; not very attentive to minds, but knowing men, that is\nto say requiring to see in order to judge; prompt and penetrating\ngood sense, practical wisdom, easy speech, prodigious memory; drawing\nincessantly on this memory, his only point of resemblance with Caesar,\nAlexander, and Napoleon; knowing deeds, facts, details, dates, proper\nnames, ignorant of tendencies, passions, the diverse geniuses of the\ncrowd, the interior aspirations, the hidden and obscure uprisings of\nsouls, in a word, all that can be designated as the invisible currents\nof consciences; accepted by the surface, but little in accord with\nFrance lower down; extricating himself by dint of tact; governing too\nmuch and not enough; his own first minister; excellent at creating out\nof the pettiness of realities an obstacle to the immensity of ideas;\nmingling a genuine creative faculty of civilization, of order and\norganization, an indescribable spirit of proceedings and chicanery, the\nfounder and lawyer of a dynasty; having something of Charlemagne and\nsomething of an attorney; in short, a lofty and original figure, a\nprince who understood how to create authority in spite of the uneasiness\nof France, and power in spite of the jealousy of Europe. Louis Philippe\nwill be classed among the eminent men of his century, and would be\nranked among the most illustrious governors of history had he loved\nglory but a little, and if he had had the sentiment of what is great to\nthe same degree as the feeling for what is useful.\n\nLouis Philippe had been handsome, and in his old age he remained\ngraceful; not always approved by the nation, he always was so by the\nmasses; he pleased. He had that gift of charming. He lacked majesty; he\nwore no crown, although a king, and no white hair, although an old man;\nhis manners belonged to the old regime and his habits to the new; a\nmixture of the noble and the bourgeois which suited 1830; Louis Philippe\nwas transition reigning; he had preserved the ancient pronunciation\nand the ancient orthography which he placed at the service of opinions\nmodern; he loved Poland and Hungary, but he wrote les Polonois, and he\npronounced les Hongrais. He wore the uniform of the national guard, like\nCharles X., and the ribbon of the Legion of Honor, like Napoleon.\n\nHe went a little to chapel, not at all to the chase, never to the opera.\nIncorruptible by sacristans, by whippers-in, by ballet-dancers; this\nmade a part of his bourgeois popularity. He had no heart. He went out\nwith his umbrella under his arm, and this umbrella long formed a part of\nhis aureole. He was a bit of a mason, a bit of a gardener, something\nof a doctor; he bled a postilion who had tumbled from his horse; Louis\nPhilippe no more went about without his lancet, than did Henri IV.\nwithout his poniard. The Royalists jeered at this ridiculous king, the\nfirst who had ever shed blood with the object of healing.\n\nFor the grievances against Louis Philippe, there is one deduction to be\nmade; there is that which accuses royalty, that which accuses the reign,\nthat which accuses the King; three columns which all give different\ntotals. Democratic right confiscated, progress becomes a matter of\nsecondary interest, the protests of the street violently repressed,\nmilitary execution of insurrections, the rising passed over by arms, the\nRue Transnonain, the counsels of war, the absorption of the real\ncountry by the legal country, on half shares with three hundred thousand\nprivileged persons,--these are the deeds of royalty; Belgium refused,\nAlgeria too harshly conquered, and, as in the case of India by the\nEnglish, with more barbarism than civilization, the breach of faith, to\nAbd-el-Kader, Blaye, Deutz bought, Pritchard paid,--these are the doings\nof the reign; the policy which was more domestic than national was the\ndoing of the King.\n\nAs will be seen, the proper deduction having been made, the King's\ncharge is decreased.\n\nThis is his great fault; he was modest in the name of France.\n\nWhence arises this fault?\n\nWe will state it.\n\nLouis Philippe was rather too much of a paternal king; that incubation\nof a family with the object of founding a dynasty is afraid of\neverything and does not like to be disturbed; hence excessive timidity,\nwhich is displeasing to the people, who have the 14th of July in their\ncivil and Austerlitz in their military tradition.\n\nMoreover, if we deduct the public duties which require to be fulfilled\nfirst of all, that deep tenderness of Louis Philippe towards his\nfamily was deserved by the family. That domestic group was worthy of\nadmiration. Virtues there dwelt side by side with talents. One of Louis\nPhilippe's daughters, Marie d'Orleans, placed the name of her race among\nartists, as Charles d'Orleans had placed it among poets. She made of\nher soul a marble which she named Jeanne d'Arc. Two of Louis Philippe's\ndaughters elicited from Metternich this eulogium: \"They are young people\nsuch as are rarely seen, and princes such as are never seen.\"\n\nThis, without any dissimulation, and also without any exaggeration, is\nthe truth about Louis Philippe.\n\nTo be Prince Equality, to bear in his own person the contradiction of\nthe Restoration and the Revolution, to have that disquieting side of the\nrevolutionary which becomes reassuring in governing power, therein lay\nthe fortune of Louis Philippe in 1830; never was there a more complete\nadaptation of a man to an event; the one entered into the other, and the\nincarnation took place. Louis Philippe is 1830 made man. Moreover, he\nhad in his favor that great recommendation to the throne, exile. He had\nbeen proscribed, a wanderer, poor. He had lived by his own labor. In\nSwitzerland, this heir to the richest princely domains in France had\nsold an old horse in order to obtain bread. At Reichenau, he gave\nlessons in mathematics, while his sister Adelaide did wool work and\nsewed. These souvenirs connected with a king rendered the bourgeoisie\nenthusiastic. He had, with his own hands, demolished the iron cage of\nMont-Saint-Michel, built by Louis XI, and used by Louis XV. He was the\ncompanion of Dumouriez, he was the friend of Lafayette; he had belonged\nto the Jacobins' club; Mirabeau had slapped him on the shoulder; Danton\nhad said to him: \"Young man!\" At the age of four and twenty, in '93,\nbeing then M. de Chartres, he had witnessed, from the depth of a box,\nthe trial of Louis XVI., so well named that poor tyrant. The blind\nclairvoyance of the Revolution, breaking royalty in the King and the\nKing with royalty, did so almost without noticing the man in the fierce\ncrushing of the idea, the vast storm of the Assembly-Tribunal, the\npublic wrath interrogating, Capet not knowing what to reply, the\nalarming, stupefied vacillation by that royal head beneath that sombre\nbreath, the relative innocence of all in that catastrophe, of those\nwho condemned as well as of the man condemned,--he had looked on those\nthings, he had contemplated that giddiness; he had seen the centuries\nappear before the bar of the Assembly-Convention; he had beheld, behind\nLouis XVI., that unfortunate passer-by who was made responsible, the\nterrible culprit, the monarchy, rise through the shadows; and there had\nlingered in his soul the respectful fear of these immense justices of\nthe populace, which are almost as impersonal as the justice of God.\n\nThe trace left in him by the Revolution was prodigious. Its memory was\nlike a living imprint of those great years, minute by minute. One day,\nin the presence of a witness whom we are not permitted to doubt, he\nrectified from memory the whole of the letter A in the alphabetical list\nof the Constituent Assembly.\n\nLouis Philippe was a king of the broad daylight. While he reigned the\npress was free, the tribune was free, conscience and speech were free.\nThe laws of September are open to sight. Although fully aware of the\ngnawing power of light on privileges, he left his throne exposed to the\nlight. History will do justice to him for this loyalty.\n\nLouis Philippe, like all historical men who have passed from the scene,\nis to-day put on his trial by the human conscience. His case is, as yet,\nonly in the lower court.\n\nThe hour when history speaks with its free and venerable accent, has\nnot yet sounded for him; the moment has not come to pronounce a definite\njudgment on this king; the austere and illustrious historian Louis Blanc\nhas himself recently softened his first verdict; Louis Philippe was\nelected by those two almosts which are called the 221 and 1830, that is\nto say, by a half-Parliament, and a half-revolution; and in any case,\nfrom the superior point of view where philosophy must place itself, we\ncannot judge him here, as the reader has seen above, except with certain\nreservations in the name of the absolute democratic principle; in the\neyes of the absolute, outside these two rights, the right of man in the\nfirst place, the right of the people in the second, all is usurpation;\nbut what we can say, even at the present day, that after making these\nreserves is, that to sum up the whole, and in whatever manner he is\nconsidered, Louis Philippe, taken in himself, and from the point of view\nof human goodness, will remain, to use the antique language of ancient\nhistory, one of the best princes who ever sat on a throne.\n\nWhat is there against him? That throne. Take away Louis Philippe the\nking, there remains the man. And the man is good. He is good at times\neven to the point of being admirable. Often, in the midst of his gravest\nsouvenirs, after a day of conflict with the whole diplomacy of the\ncontinent, he returned at night to his apartments, and there, exhausted\nwith fatigue, overwhelmed with sleep, what did he do? He took a death\nsentence and passed the night in revising a criminal suit, considering\nit something to hold his own against Europe, but that it was a still\ngreater matter to rescue a man from the executioner. He obstinately\nmaintained his opinion against his keeper of the seals; he disputed the\nground with the guillotine foot by foot against the crown attorneys,\nthose chatterers of the law, as he called them. Sometimes the pile of\nsentences covered his table; he examined them all; it was anguish to\nhim to abandon these miserable, condemned heads. One day, he said to\nthe same witness to whom we have recently referred: \"I won seven last\nnight.\" During the early years of his reign, the death penalty was\nas good as abolished, and the erection of a scaffold was a violence\ncommitted against the King. The Greve having disappeared with the elder\nbranch, a bourgeois place of execution was instituted under the name\nof the Barriere-Saint-Jacques; \"practical men\" felt the necessity of\na quasi-legitimate guillotine; and this was one of the victories of\nCasimir Perier, who represented the narrow sides of the bourgeoisie,\nover Louis Philippe, who represented its liberal sides. Louis Philippe\nannotated Beccaria with his own hand. After the Fieschi machine, he\nexclaimed: \"What a pity that I was not wounded! Then I might have\npardoned!\" On another occasion, alluding to the resistance offered by\nhis ministry, he wrote in connection with a political criminal, who is\none of the most generous figures of our day: \"His pardon is granted; it\nonly remains for me to obtain it.\" Louis Philippe was as gentle as Louis\nIX. and as kindly as Henri IV.\n\nNow, to our mind, in history, where kindness is the rarest of pearls,\nthe man who is kindly almost takes precedence of the man who is great.\n\nLouis Philippe having been severely judged by some, harshly, perhaps, by\nothers, it is quite natural that a man, himself a phantom at the present\nday, who knew that king, should come and testify in his favor before\nhistory; this deposition, whatever else it may be, is evidently and\nabove all things, entirely disinterested; an epitaph penned by a dead\nman is sincere; one shade may console another shade; the sharing of the\nsame shadows confers the right to praise it; it is not greatly to\nbe feared that it will ever be said of two tombs in exile: \"This one\nflattered the other.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV--CRACKS BENEATH THE FOUNDATION\n\nAt the moment when the drama which we are narrating is on the point of\npenetrating into the depths of one of the tragic clouds which envelop\nthe beginning of Louis Philippe's reign, it was necessary that there\nshould be no equivoque, and it became requisite that this book should\noffer some explanation with regard to this king.\n\nLouis Philippe had entered into possession of his royal authority\nwithout violence, without any direct action on his part, by virtue of a\nrevolutionary change, evidently quite distinct from the real aim of the\nRevolution, but in which he, the Duc d'Orleans, exercised no personal\ninitiative. He had been born a Prince, and he believed himself to have\nbeen elected King. He had not served this mandate on himself; he had not\ntaken it; it had been offered to him, and he had accepted it; convinced,\nwrongly, to be sure, but convinced nevertheless, that the offer was in\naccordance with right and that the acceptance of it was in accordance\nwith duty. Hence his possession was in good faith. Now, we say it in\ngood conscience, Louis Philippe being in possession in perfect good\nfaith, and the democracy being in good faith in its attack, the amount\nof terror discharged by the social conflicts weighs neither on the\nKing nor on the democracy. A clash of principles resembles a clash of\nelements. The ocean defends the water, the hurricane defends the\nair, the King defends Royalty, the democracy defends the people; the\nrelative, which is the monarchy, resists the absolute, which is the\nrepublic; society bleeds in this conflict, but that which constitutes\nits suffering to-day will constitute its safety later on; and, in any\ncase, those who combat are not to be blamed; one of the two parties is\nevidently mistaken; the right is not, like the Colossus of Rhodes, on\ntwo shores at once, with one foot on the republic, and one in Royalty;\nit is indivisible, and all on one side; but those who are in error are\nso sincerely; a blind man is no more a criminal than a Vendean is a\nruffian. Let us, then, impute to the fatality of things alone these\nformidable collisions. Whatever the nature of these tempests may be,\nhuman irresponsibility is mingled with them.\n\nLet us complete this exposition.\n\nThe government of 1830 led a hard life immediately. Born yesterday, it\nwas obliged to fight to-day.\n\nHardly installed, it was already everywhere conscious of vague movements\nof traction on the apparatus of July so recently laid, and so lacking in\nsolidity.\n\nResistance was born on the morrow; perhaps even, it was born on the\npreceding evening. From month to month the hostility increased, and from\nbeing concealed it became patent.\n\nThe Revolution of July, which gained but little acceptance outside of\nFrance by kings, had been diversely interpreted in France, as we have\nsaid.\n\nGod delivers over to men his visible will in events, an obscure text\nwritten in a mysterious tongue. Men immediately make translations of it;\ntranslations hasty, incorrect, full of errors, of gaps, and of nonsense.\nVery few minds comprehend the divine language. The most sagacious, the\ncalmest, the most profound, decipher slowly, and when they arrive with\ntheir text, the task has long been completed; there are already twenty\ntranslations on the public place. From each remaining springs a party,\nand from each misinterpretation a faction; and each party thinks that it\nalone has the true text, and each faction thinks that it possesses the\nlight.\n\nPower itself is often a faction.\n\nThere are, in revolutions, swimmers who go against the current; they are\nthe old parties.\n\nFor the old parties who clung to heredity by the grace of God, think\nthat revolutions, having sprung from the right to revolt, one has the\nright to revolt against them. Error. For in these revolutions, the one\nwho revolts is not the people; it is the king. Revolution is precisely\nthe contrary of revolt. Every revolution, being a normal outcome,\ncontains within itself its legitimacy, which false revolutionists\nsometimes dishonor, but which remains even when soiled, which survives\neven when stained with blood.\n\nRevolutions spring not from an accident, but from necessity. A\nrevolution is a return from the fictitious to the real. It is because it\nmust be that it is.\n\nNone the less did the old legitimist parties assail the Revolution of\n1830 with all the vehemence which arises from false reasoning. Errors\nmake excellent projectiles. They strike it cleverly in its vulnerable\nspot, in default of a cuirass, in its lack of logic; they attacked this\nrevolution in its royalty. They shouted to it: \"Revolution, why this\nking?\" Factions are blind men who aim correctly.\n\nThis cry was uttered equally by the republicans. But coming from\nthem, this cry was logical. What was blindness in the legitimists was\nclearness of vision in the democrats. 1830 had bankrupted the people.\nThe enraged democracy reproached it with this.\n\nBetween the attack of the past and the attack of the future, the\nestablishment of July struggled. It represented the minute at\nloggerheads on the one hand with the monarchical centuries, on the other\nhand with eternal right.\n\nIn addition, and beside all this, as it was no longer revolution and had\nbecome a monarchy, 1830 was obliged to take precedence of all Europe. To\nkeep the peace, was an increase of complication. A harmony established\ncontrary to sense is often more onerous than a war. From this secret\nconflict, always muzzled, but always growling, was born armed peace,\nthat ruinous expedient of civilization which in the harness of the\nEuropean cabinets is suspicious in itself. The Royalty of July reared\nup, in spite of the fact that it caught it in the harness of European\ncabinets. Metternich would gladly have put it in kicking-straps. Pushed\non in France by progress, it pushed on the monarchies, those loiterers\nin Europe. After having been towed, it undertook to tow.\n\nMeanwhile, within her, pauperism, the proletariat, salary, education,\npenal servitude, prostitution, the fate of the woman, wealth, misery,\nproduction, consumption, division, exchange, coin, credit, the rights of\ncapital, the rights of labor,--all these questions were multiplied above\nsociety, a terrible slope.\n\nOutside of political parties properly so called, another movement became\nmanifest. Philosophical fermentation replied to democratic fermentation.\nThe elect felt troubled as well as the masses; in another manner, but\nquite as much.\n\nThinkers meditated, while the soil, that is to say, the people,\ntraversed by revolutionary currents, trembled under them with\nindescribably vague epileptic shocks. These dreamers, some isolated,\nothers united in families and almost in communion, turned over social\nquestions in a pacific but profound manner; impassive miners, who\ntranquilly pushed their galleries into the depths of a volcano, hardly\ndisturbed by the dull commotion and the furnaces of which they caught\nglimpses.\n\nThis tranquillity was not the least beautiful spectacle of this agitated\nepoch.\n\nThese men left to political parties the question of rights, they\noccupied themselves with the question of happiness.\n\nThe well-being of man, that was what they wanted to extract from\nsociety.\n\nThey raised material questions, questions of agriculture, of industry,\nof commerce, almost to the dignity of a religion. In civilization, such\nas it has formed itself, a little by the command of God, a great deal by\nthe agency of man, interests combine, unite, and amalgamate in a\nmanner to form a veritable hard rock, in accordance with a dynamic law,\npatiently studied by economists, those geologists of politics. These men\nwho grouped themselves under different appellations, but who may all be\ndesignated by the generic title of socialists, endeavored to pierce that\nrock and to cause it to spout forth the living waters of human felicity.\n\nFrom the question of the scaffold to the question of war, their works\nembraced everything. To the rights of man, as proclaimed by the French\nRevolution, they added the rights of woman and the rights of the child.\n\nThe reader will not be surprised if, for various reasons, we do not\nhere treat in a thorough manner, from the theoretical point of view, the\nquestions raised by socialism. We confine ourselves to indicating them.\n\nAll the problems that the socialists proposed to themselves, cosmogonic\nvisions, revery and mysticism being cast aside, can be reduced to two\nprincipal problems.\n\nFirst problem: To produce wealth.\n\nSecond problem: To share it.\n\nThe first problem contains the question of work.\n\nThe second contains the question of salary.\n\nIn the first problem the employment of forces is in question.\n\nIn the second, the distribution of enjoyment.\n\nFrom the proper employment of forces results public power.\n\nFrom a good distribution of enjoyments results individual happiness.\n\nBy a good distribution, not an equal but an equitable distribution must\nbe understood.\n\nFrom these two things combined, the public power without, individual\nhappiness within, results social prosperity.\n\nSocial prosperity means the man happy, the citizen free, the nation\ngreat.\n\nEngland solves the first of these two problems. She creates wealth\nadmirably, she divides it badly. This solution which is complete on\none side only leads her fatally to two extremes: monstrous opulence,\nmonstrous wretchedness. All enjoyments for some, all privations for the\nrest, that is to say, for the people; privilege, exception, monopoly,\nfeudalism, born from toil itself. A false and dangerous situation, which\nsates public power or private misery, which sets the roots of the State\nin the sufferings of the individual. A badly constituted grandeur in\nwhich are combined all the material elements and into which no moral\nelement enters.\n\nCommunism and agrarian law think that they solve the second problem.\nThey are mistaken. Their division kills production. Equal partition\nabolishes emulation; and consequently labor. It is a partition made\nby the butcher, which kills that which it divides. It is therefore\nimpossible to pause over these pretended solutions. Slaying wealth is\nnot the same thing as dividing it.\n\nThe two problems require to be solved together, to be well solved. The\ntwo problems must be combined and made but one.\n\nSolve only the first of the two problems; you will be Venice, you will\nbe England. You will have, like Venice, an artificial power, or, like\nEngland, a material power; you will be the wicked rich man. You will die\nby an act of violence, as Venice died, or by bankruptcy, as England\nwill fall. And the world will allow to die and fall all that is merely\nselfishness, all that does not represent for the human race either a\nvirtue or an idea.\n\nIt is well understood here, that by the words Venice, England, we\ndesignate not the peoples, but social structures; the oligarchies\nsuperposed on nations, and not the nations themselves. The nations\nalways have our respect and our sympathy. Venice, as a people, will live\nagain; England, the aristocracy, will fall, but England, the nation, is\nimmortal. That said, we continue.\n\nSolve the two problems, encourage the wealthy, and protect the poor,\nsuppress misery, put an end to the unjust farming out of the feeble by\nthe strong, put a bridle on the iniquitous jealousy of the man who\nis making his way against the man who has reached the goal, adjust,\nmathematically and fraternally, salary to labor, mingle gratuitous and\ncompulsory education with the growth of childhood, and make of science\nthe base of manliness, develop minds while keeping arms busy, be at one\nand the same time a powerful people and a family of happy men, render\nproperty democratic, not by abolishing it, but by making it universal,\nso that every citizen, without exception, may be a proprietor, an easier\nmatter than is generally supposed; in two words, learn how to produce\nwealth and how to distribute it, and you will have at once moral and\nmaterial greatness; and you will be worthy to call yourself France.\n\nThis is what socialism said outside and above a few sects which have\ngone astray; that is what it sought in facts, that is what it sketched\nout in minds.\n\nEfforts worthy of admiration! Sacred attempts!\n\nThese doctrines, these theories, these resistances, the unforeseen\nnecessity for the statesman to take philosophers into account, confused\nevidences of which we catch a glimpse, a new system of politics to be\ncreated, which shall be in accord with the old world without too much\ndisaccord with the new revolutionary ideal, a situation in which it\nbecame necessary to use Lafayette to defend Polignac, the intuition of\nprogress transparent beneath the revolt, the chambers and streets, the\ncompetitions to be brought into equilibrium around him, his faith in\nthe Revolution, perhaps an eventual indefinable resignation born of the\nvague acceptance of a superior definitive right, his desire to remain of\nhis race, his domestic spirit, his sincere respect for the people, his\nown honesty, preoccupied Louis Philippe almost painfully, and there were\nmoments when strong and courageous as he was, he was overwhelmed by the\ndifficulties of being a king.\n\nHe felt under his feet a formidable disaggregation, which was not,\nnevertheless, a reduction to dust, France being more France than ever.\n\nPiles of shadows covered the horizon. A strange shade, gradually drawing\nnearer, extended little by little over men, over things, over ideas;\na shade which came from wraths and systems. Everything which had been\nhastily stifled was moving and fermenting. At times the conscience of\nthe honest man resumed its breathing, so great was the discomfort\nof that air in which sophisms were intermingled with truths. Spirits\ntrembled in the social anxiety like leaves at the approach of a storm.\nThe electric tension was such that at certain instants, the first comer,\na stranger, brought light. Then the twilight obscurity closed in again.\nAt intervals, deep and dull mutterings allowed a judgment to be formed\nas to the quantity of thunder contained by the cloud.\n\nTwenty months had barely elapsed since the Revolution of July, the year\n1832 had opened with an aspect of something impending and threatening.\n\nThe distress of the people, the laborers without bread, the last Prince\nde Conde engulfed in the shadows, Brussels expelling the Nassaus as\nParis did the Bourbons, Belgium offering herself to a French Prince\nand giving herself to an English Prince, the Russian hatred of Nicolas,\nbehind us the demons of the South, Ferdinand in Spain, Miguel in\nPortugal, the earth quaking in Italy, Metternich extending his hand over\nBologna, France treating Austria sharply at Ancona, at the North no one\nknew what sinister sound of the hammer nailing up Poland in her coffin,\nirritated glances watching France narrowly all over Europe, England, a\nsuspected ally, ready to give a push to that which was tottering and to\nhurl herself on that which should fall, the peerage sheltering itself\nbehind Beccaria to refuse four heads to the law, the fleurs-de-lys\nerased from the King's carriage, the cross torn from Notre Dame,\nLafayette lessened, Laffitte ruined, Benjamin Constant dead in\nindigence, Casimir Perier dead in the exhaustion of his power; political\nand social malady breaking out simultaneously in the two capitals of the\nkingdom, the one in the city of thought, the other in the city of toil;\nat Paris civil war, at Lyons servile war; in the two cities, the same\nglare of the furnace; a crater-like crimson on the brow of the people;\nthe South rendered fanatic, the West troubled, the Duchesse de Berry in\nla Vendee, plots, conspiracies, risings, cholera, added the sombre roar\nof tumult of events to the sombre roar of ideas.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V--FACTS WHENCE HISTORY SPRINGS AND WHICH HISTORY IGNORES\n\nTowards the end of April, everything had become aggravated. The\nfermentation entered the boiling state. Ever since 1830, petty partial\nrevolts had been going on here and there, which were quickly suppressed,\nbut ever bursting forth afresh, the sign of a vast underlying\nconflagration. Something terrible was in preparation. Glimpses could be\ncaught of the features still indistinct and imperfectly lighted, of a\npossible revolution. France kept an eye on Paris; Paris kept an eye on\nthe Faubourg Saint-Antoine.\n\nThe Faubourg Saint-Antoine, which was in a dull glow, was beginning its\nebullition.\n\n[Illustration: A Street Orator  4b1-5-street-orator]\n\nThe wine-shops of the Rue de Charonne were, although the union of\nthe two epithets seems singular when applied to wine-shops, grave and\nstormy.\n\nThe government was there purely and simply called in question. There\npeople publicly discussed the question of fighting or of keeping quiet.\nThere were back shops where workingmen were made to swear that they\nwould hasten into the street at the first cry of alarm, and \"that they\nwould fight without counting the number of the enemy.\" This engagement\nonce entered into, a man seated in the corner of the wine-shop \"assumed\na sonorous tone,\" and said, \"You understand! You have sworn!\"\n\nSometimes they went up stairs, to a private room on the first floor,\nand there scenes that were almost masonic were enacted. They made the\ninitiated take oaths to render service to himself as well as to the\nfathers of families. That was the formula.\n\nIn the tap-rooms, \"subversive\" pamphlets were read. They treated the\ngovernment with contempt, says a secret report of that time.\n\nWords like the following could be heard there:--\n\n\"I don't know the names of the leaders. We folks shall not know the day\nuntil two hours beforehand.\" One workman said: \"There are three hundred\nof us, let each contribute ten sous, that will make one hundred and\nfifty francs with which to procure powder and shot.\"\n\nAnother said: \"I don't ask for six months, I don't ask for even two.\nIn less than a fortnight we shall be parallel with the government. With\ntwenty-five thousand men we can face them.\" Another said: \"I don't sleep\nat night, because I make cartridges all night.\" From time to time,\nmen \"of bourgeois appearance, and in good coats\" came and \"caused\nembarrassment,\" and with the air of \"command,\" shook hands with the most\nimportant, and then went away. They never stayed more than ten minutes.\nSignificant remarks were exchanged in a low tone: \"The plot is ripe, the\nmatter is arranged.\" \"It was murmured by all who were there,\" to borrow\nthe very expression of one of those who were present. The exaltation was\nsuch that one day, a workingman exclaimed, before the whole wine-shop:\n\"We have no arms!\" One of his comrades replied: \"The soldiers have!\"\nthus parodying without being aware of the fact, Bonaparte's proclamation\nto the army in Italy: \"When they had anything of a more secret nature on\nhand,\" adds one report, \"they did not communicate it to each other.\" It\nis not easy to understand what they could conceal after what they said.\n\nThese reunions were sometimes periodical. At certain ones of them, there\nwere never more than eight or ten persons present, and they were always\nthe same. In others, any one entered who wished, and the room was\nso full that they were forced to stand. Some went thither through\nenthusiasm and passion; others because it was on their way to their\nwork. As during the Revolution, there were patriotic women in some of\nthese wine-shops who embraced new-comers.\n\nOther expressive facts came to light.\n\nA man would enter a shop, drink, and go his way with the remark:\n\"Wine-merchant, the revolution will pay what is due to you.\"\n\nRevolutionary agents were appointed in a wine-shop facing the Rue de\nCharonne. The balloting was carried on in their caps.\n\nWorkingmen met at the house of a fencing-master who gave lessons in\nthe Rue de Cotte. There there was a trophy of arms formed of wooden\nbroadswords, canes, clubs, and foils. One day, the buttons were removed\nfrom the foils.\n\nA workman said: \"There are twenty-five of us, but they don't count\non me, because I am looked upon as a machine.\" Later on, that machine\nbecame Quenisset.\n\nThe indefinite things which were brewing gradually acquired a strange\nand indescribable notoriety. A woman sweeping off her doorsteps said\nto another woman: \"For a long time, there has been a strong force busy\nmaking cartridges.\" In the open street, proclamation could be seen\naddressed to the National Guard in the departments. One of these\nproclamations was signed: Burtot, wine-merchant.\n\nOne day a man with his beard worn like a collar and with an Italian\naccent mounted a stone post at the door of a liquor-seller in the Marche\nLenoir, and read aloud a singular document, which seemed to emanate from\nan occult power. Groups formed around him, and applauded.\n\nThe passages which touched the crowd most deeply were collected and\nnoted down. \"--Our doctrines are trammelled, our proclamations torn, our\nbill-stickers are spied upon and thrown into prison.\"--\"The breakdown\nwhich has recently taken place in cottons has converted to us many\nmediums.\"--\"The future of nations is being worked out in our obscure\nranks.\"--\"Here are the fixed terms: action or reaction, revolution or\ncounter-revolution. For, at our epoch, we no longer believe either in\ninertia or in immobility. For the people against the people, that is the\nquestion. There is no other.\"--\"On the day when we cease to suit you,\nbreak us, but up to that day, help us to march on.\" All this in broad\ndaylight.\n\nOther deeds, more audacious still, were suspicious in the eyes of the\npeople by reason of their very audacity. On the 4th of April, 1832, a\npasser-by mounted the post on the corner which forms the angle of the\nRue Sainte-Marguerite and shouted: \"I am a Babouvist!\" But beneath\nBabeuf, the people scented Gisquet.\n\nAmong other things, this man said:--\n\n\"Down with property! The opposition of the left is cowardly and\ntreacherous. When it wants to be on the right side, it preaches\nrevolution, it is democratic in order to escape being beaten, and\nroyalist so that it may not have to fight. The republicans are beasts\nwith feathers. Distrust the republicans, citizens of the laboring\nclasses.\"\n\n\"Silence, citizen spy!\" cried an artisan.\n\nThis shout put an end to the discourse.\n\nMysterious incidents occurred.\n\nAt nightfall, a workingman encountered near the canal a \"very well\ndressed man,\" who said to him: \"Whither are you bound, citizen?\" \"Sir,\"\nreplied the workingman, \"I have not the honor of your acquaintance.\" \"I\nknow you very well, however.\" And the man added: \"Don't be alarmed, I\nam an agent of the committee. You are suspected of not being quite\nfaithful. You know that if you reveal anything, there is an eye fixed on\nyou.\" Then he shook hands with the workingman and went away, saying: \"We\nshall meet again soon.\"\n\nThe police, who were on the alert, collected singular dialogues, not\nonly in the wine-shops, but in the street.\n\n\"Get yourself received very soon,\" said a weaver to a cabinet-maker.\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"There is going to be a shot to fire.\"\n\nTwo ragged pedestrians exchanged these remarkable replies, fraught with\nevident Jacquerie:--\n\n\"Who governs us?\"\n\n\"M. Philippe.\"\n\n\"No, it is the bourgeoisie.\"\n\nThe reader is mistaken if he thinks that we take the word Jacquerie in a\nbad sense. The Jacques were the poor.\n\nOn another occasion two men were heard to say to each other as they\npassed by: \"We have a good plan of attack.\"\n\nOnly the following was caught of a private conversation between four men\nwho were crouching in a ditch of the circle of the Barriere du Trone:--\n\n\"Everything possible will be done to prevent his walking about Paris any\nmore.\"\n\nWho was the he? Menacing obscurity.\n\n\"The principal leaders,\" as they said in the faubourg, held themselves\napart. It was supposed that they met for consultation in a wine-shop\nnear the point Saint-Eustache. A certain Aug--, chief of the Society\naid for tailors, Rue Mondetour, had the reputation of serving as\nintermediary central between the leaders and the Faubourg Saint-Antoine.\n\nNevertheless, there was always a great deal of mystery about these\nleaders, and no certain fact can invalidate the singular arrogance of\nthis reply made later on by a man accused before the Court of Peers:--\n\n\"Who was your leader?\"\n\n\"I knew of none and I recognized none.\"\n\nThere was nothing but words, transparent but vague; sometimes idle\nreports, rumors, hearsay. Other indications cropped up.\n\nA carpenter, occupied in nailing boards to a fence around the ground\non which a house was in process of construction, in the Rue de Reuilly\nfound on that plot the torn fragment of a letter on which were still\nlegible the following lines:--\n\n\nThe committee must take measures to prevent recruiting in the sections\nfor the different societies.\n\n\nAnd, as a postscript:--\n\n\nWe have learned that there are guns in the Rue du Faubourg-Poissonniere,\nNo. 5 [bis], to the number of five or six thousand, in the house of a\ngunsmith in that court. The section owns no arms.\n\n\nWhat excited the carpenter and caused him to show this thing to his\nneighbors was the fact, that a few paces further on he picked up another\npaper, torn like the first, and still more significant, of which we\nreproduce a facsimile, because of the historical interest attaching to\nthese strange documents:--\n\n[Illustration: Code Table 4b1-5 page 26]\n\n +------------------------------------------------------------+\n | Q | C | D | E | Learn this list by heart.  After so doing\n | | | | | | you will tear it up.  The men admitted\n | | | | | | will do the same when you have transmitted\n | | | | | | their orders to them.\n | | | | | | Health and Fraternity,\n | | | | | | u og a fe L. |\n +------------------------------------------------------------+\n\nIt was only later on that the persons who were in the secret of this\nfind at the time, learned the significance of those four capital\nletters: quinturions, centurions, decurions, eclaireurs [scouts], and\nthe sense of the letters: u og a fe, which was a date, and meant April\n15th, 1832. Under each capital letter were inscribed names followed by\nvery characteristic notes. Thus: Q. Bannerel. 8 guns, 83 cartridges. A\nsafe man.--C. Boubiere. 1 pistol, 40 cartridges.--D. Rollet. 1 foil,\n1 pistol, 1 pound of powder.--E. Tessier. 1 sword, 1 cartridge-box.\nExact.--Terreur. 8 guns. Brave, etc.\n\nFinally, this carpenter found, still in the same enclosure, a third\npaper on which was written in pencil, but very legibly, this sort of\nenigmatical list:--\n\n          Unite:  Blanchard: Arbre-Sec. 6.\n          Barra.  Soize.  Salle-au-Comte.\n          Kosciusko. Aubry the Butcher?\n          J. J. R.\n          Caius Gracchus.\n          Right of revision.  Dufond.  Four.\n          Fall of the Girondists.  Derbac.  Maubuee.\n          Washington.  Pinson.  1 pistol, 86 cartridges.\n          Marseillaise.\n          Sovereignty of the people. Michel. Quincampoix. Sword.\n          Hoche.\n          Marceau.  Plato.  Arbre-Sec.\n          Warsaw.  Tilly, crier of the Populaire.\n\n\nThe honest bourgeois into whose hands this list fell knew its\nsignificance. It appears that this list was the complete nomenclature of\nthe sections of the fourth arondissement of the Society of the Rights\nof Man, with the names and dwellings of the chiefs of sections. To-day,\nwhen all these facts which were obscure are nothing more than history,\nwe may publish them. It should be added, that the foundation of the\nSociety of the Rights of Man seems to have been posterior to the date\nwhen this paper was found. Perhaps this was only a rough draft.\n\nStill, according to all the remarks and the words, according to written\nnotes, material facts begin to make their appearance.\n\nIn the Rue Popincourt, in the house of a dealer in bric-abrac, there\nwere seized seven sheets of gray paper, all folded alike lengthwise\nand in four; these sheets enclosed twenty-six squares of this same\ngray paper folded in the form of a cartridge, and a card, on which was\nwritten the following:--\n\n           Saltpetre . . . . . . . . . . .  12 ounces.\n           Sulphur   . . . . . . . . . . .   2 ounces.\n           Charcoal  . . . . . . . . . . .   2 ounces and a half.\n           Water     . . . . . . . . . . .   2 ounces.\n\n\nThe report of the seizure stated that the drawer exhaled a strong smell\nof powder.\n\nA mason returning from his day's work, left behind him a little package\non a bench near the bridge of Austerlitz. This package was taken to\nthe police station. It was opened, and in it were found two printed\ndialogues, signed Lahautiere, a song entitled: \"Workmen, band together,\"\nand a tin box full of cartridges.\n\nOne artisan drinking with a comrade made the latter feel him to see how\nwarm he was; the other man felt a pistol under his waistcoat.\n\nIn a ditch on the boulevard, between Pere-Lachaise and the Barriere\ndu Trone, at the most deserted spot, some children, while playing,\ndiscovered beneath a mass of shavings and refuse bits of wood, a\nbag containing a bullet-mould, a wooden punch for the preparation of\ncartridges, a wooden bowl, in which there were grains of hunting-powder,\nand a little cast-iron pot whose interior presented evident traces of\nmelted lead.\n\nPolice agents, making their way suddenly and unexpectedly at five\no'clock in the morning, into the dwelling of a certain Pardon, who\nwas afterwards a member of the Barricade-Merry section and got himself\nkilled in the insurrection of April, 1834, found him standing near his\nbed, and holding in his hand some cartridges which he was in the act of\npreparing.\n\nTowards the hour when workingmen repose, two men were seen to meet\nbetween the Barriere Picpus and the Barriere Charenton in a little lane\nbetween two walls, near a wine-shop, in front of which there was a \"Jeu\nde Siam.\"[33] One drew a pistol from beneath his blouse and handed it to\nthe other. As he was handing it to him, he noticed that the perspiration\nof his chest had made the powder damp. He primed the pistol and added\nmore powder to what was already in the pan. Then the two men parted.\n\nA certain Gallais, afterwards killed in the Rue Beaubourg in the affair\nof April, boasted of having in his house seven hundred cartridges and\ntwenty-four flints.\n\nThe government one day received a warning that arms and two hundred\nthousand cartridges had just been distributed in the faubourg. On\nthe following week thirty thousand cartridges were distributed. The\nremarkable point about it was, that the police were not able to seize a\nsingle one.\n\nAn intercepted letter read: \"The day is not far distant when, within\nfour hours by the clock, eighty thousand patriots will be under arms.\"\n\nAll this fermentation was public, one might almost say tranquil. The\napproaching insurrection was preparing its storm calmly in the face of\nthe government. No singularity was lacking to this still subterranean\ncrisis, which was already perceptible. The bourgeois talked peaceably to\nthe working-classes of what was in preparation. They said: \"How is the\nrising coming along?\" in the same tone in which they would have said:\n\"How is your wife?\"\n\nA furniture-dealer, of the Rue Moreau, inquired: \"Well, when are you\ngoing to make the attack?\"\n\nAnother shop-keeper said:--\n\n\"The attack will be made soon.\"\n\n\"I know it. A month ago, there were fifteen thousand of you, now there\nare twenty-five thousand.\" He offered his gun, and a neighbor offered a\nsmall pistol which he was willing to sell for seven francs.\n\nMoreover, the revolutionary fever was growing. Not a point in Paris nor\nin France was exempt from it. The artery was beating everywhere. Like\nthose membranes which arise from certain inflammations and form in the\nhuman body, the network of secret societies began to spread all over the\ncountry. From the associations of the Friends of the People, which was\nat the same time public and secret, sprang the Society of the Rights of\nMan, which also dated from one of the orders of the day: Pluviose, Year\n40 of the republican era, which was destined to survive even the mandate\nof the Court of Assizes which pronounced its dissolution, and which\ndid not hesitate to bestow on its sections significant names like the\nfollowing:--\n\n     Pikes.\n     Tocsin.\n     Signal cannon.\n     Phrygian cap.\n     January 21.\n     The beggars.\n     The vagabonds.\n     Forward march.\n     Robespierre.\n     Level.\n     Ca Ira.\n\nThe Society of the Rights of Man engendered the Society of Action. These\nwere impatient individuals who broke away and hastened ahead. Other\nassociations sought to recruit themselves from the great mother\nsocieties. The members of sections complained that they were torn\nasunder. Thus, the Gallic Society, and the committee of organization of\nthe Municipalities. Thus the associations for the liberty of the press,\nfor individual liberty, for the instruction of the people against\nindirect taxes. Then the Society of Equal Workingmen which was divided\ninto three fractions, the levellers, the communists, the reformers.\nThen the Army of the Bastilles, a sort of cohort organized on a military\nfooting, four men commanded by a corporal, ten by a sergeant, twenty by\na sub-lieutenant, forty by a lieutenant; there were never more than\nfive men who knew each other. Creation where precaution is combined with\naudacity and which seemed stamped with the genius of Venice.\n\nThe central committee, which was at the head, had two arms, the Society\nof Action, and the Army of the Bastilles.\n\nA legitimist association, the Chevaliers of Fidelity, stirred about\namong these the republican affiliations. It was denounced and repudiated\nthere.\n\nThe Parisian societies had ramifications in the principal cities, Lyons,\nNantes, Lille, Marseilles, and each had its Society of the Rights of\nMan, the Charbonniere, and The Free Men. All had a revolutionary society\nwhich was called the Cougourde. We have already mentioned this word.\n\nIn Paris, the Faubourg Saint-Marceau kept up an equal buzzing with the\nFaubourg Saint-Antoine, and the schools were no less moved than the\nfaubourgs. A cafe in the Rue Saint-Hyacinthe and the wine-shop of the\nSeven Billiards, Rue des Mathurins-Saint-Jacques, served as rallying\npoints for the students. The Society of the Friends of the A B C\naffiliated to the Mutualists of Angers, and to the Cougourde of Aix,\nmet, as we have seen, in the Cafe Musain. These same young men assembled\nalso, as we have stated already, in a restaurant wine-shop of the Rue\nMondetour which was called Corinthe. These meetings were secret. Others\nwere as public as possible, and the reader can judge of their boldness\nfrom these fragments of an interrogatory undergone in one of the\nulterior prosecutions: \"Where was this meeting held?\" \"In the Rue de la\nPaix.\" \"At whose house?\" \"In the street.\" \"What sections were there?\"\n\"Only one.\" \"Which?\" \"The Manuel section.\" \"Who was its leader?\"\n\"I.\" \"You are too young to have decided alone upon the bold course of\nattacking the government. Where did your instructions come from?\" \"From\nthe central committee.\"\n\nThe army was mined at the same time as the population, as was proved\nsubsequently by the operations of Beford, Luneville, and Epinard. They\ncounted on the fifty-second regiment, on the fifth, on the eighth, on\nthe thirty-seventh, and on the twentieth light cavalry. In Burgundy and\nin the southern towns they planted the liberty tree; that is to say, a\npole surmounted by a red cap.\n\nSuch was the situation.\n\nThe Faubourg Saint-Antoine, more than any other group of the population,\nas we stated in the beginning, accentuated this situation and made\nit felt. That was the sore point. This old faubourg, peopled like\nan ant-hill, laborious, courageous, and angry as a hive of bees, was\nquivering with expectation and with the desire for a tumult. Everything\nwas in a state of agitation there, without any interruption, however, of\nthe regular work. It is impossible to convey an idea of this lively yet\nsombre physiognomy. In this faubourg exists poignant distress hidden\nunder attic roofs; there also exist rare and ardent minds. It is\nparticularly in the matter of distress and intelligence that it is\ndangerous to have extremes meet.\n\nThe Faubourg Saint-Antoine had also other causes to tremble; for it\nreceived the counter-shock of commercial crises, of failures, strikes,\nslack seasons, all inherent to great political disturbances. In times\nof revolution misery is both cause and effect. The blow which it deals\nrebounds upon it. This population full of proud virtue, capable to the\nhighest degree of latent heat, always ready to fly to arms, prompt to\nexplode, irritated, deep, undermined, seemed to be only awaiting the\nfall of a spark. Whenever certain sparks float on the horizon chased\nby the wind of events, it is impossible not to think of the Faubourg\nSaint-Antoine and of the formidable chance which has placed at the very\ngates of Paris that powder-house of suffering and ideas.\n\nThe wine-shops of the Faubourg Antoine, which have been more than\nonce drawn in the sketches which the reader has just perused, possess\nhistorical notoriety. In troublous times people grow intoxicated there\nmore on words than on wine. A sort of prophetic spirit and an afflatus\nof the future circulates there, swelling hearts and enlarging souls. The\ncabarets of the Faubourg Saint-Antoine resemble those taverns of Mont\nAventine erected on the cave of the Sibyl and communicating with\nthe profound and sacred breath; taverns where the tables were almost\ntripods, and where was drunk what Ennius calls the sibylline wine.\n\nThe Faubourg Saint-Antoine is a reservoir of people. Revolutionary\nagitations create fissures there, through which trickles the popular\nsovereignty. This sovereignty may do evil; it can be mistaken like any\nother; but, even when led astray, it remains great. We may say of it as\nof the blind cyclops, Ingens.\n\nIn '93, according as the idea which was floating about was good or evil,\naccording as it was the day of fanaticism or of enthusiasm, there leaped\nforth from the Faubourg Saint-Antoine now savage legions, now heroic\nbands.\n\nSavage. Let us explain this word. When these bristling men, who in the\nearly days of the revolutionary chaos, tattered, howling, wild, with\nuplifted bludgeon, pike on high, hurled themselves upon ancient Paris in\nan uproar, what did they want? They wanted an end to oppression, an\nend to tyranny, an end to the sword, work for men, instruction for the\nchild, social sweetness for the woman, liberty, equality, fraternity,\nbread for all, the idea for all, the Edenizing of the world. Progress;\nand that holy, sweet, and good thing, progress, they claimed in terrible\nwise, driven to extremities as they were, half naked, club in fist,\na roar in their mouths. They were savages, yes; but the savages of\ncivilization.\n\nThey proclaimed right furiously; they were desirous, if only with\nfear and trembling, to force the human race to paradise. They seemed\nbarbarians, and they were saviours. They demanded light with the mask of\nnight.\n\nFacing these men, who were ferocious, we admit, and terrifying, but\nferocious and terrifying for good ends, there are other men, smiling,\nembroidered, gilded, beribboned, starred, in silk stockings, in white\nplumes, in yellow gloves, in varnished shoes, who, with their elbows on\na velvet table, beside a marble chimney-piece, insist gently on demeanor\nand the preservation of the past, of the Middle Ages, of divine right,\nof fanaticism, of innocence, of slavery, of the death penalty, of war,\nglorifying in low tones and with politeness, the sword, the stake, and\nthe scaffold. For our part, if we were forced to make a choice between\nthe barbarians of civilization and the civilized men of barbarism, we\nshould choose the barbarians.\n\nBut, thank Heaven, still another choice is possible. No perpendicular\nfall is necessary, in front any more than in the rear.\n\nNeither despotism nor terrorism. We desire progress with a gentle slope.\n\nGod takes care of that. God's whole policy consists in rendering slopes\nless steep.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI--ENJOLRAS AND HIS LIEUTENANTS\n\nIt was about this epoch that Enjolras, in view of a possible\ncatastrophe, instituted a kind of mysterious census.\n\nAll were present at a secret meeting at the Cafe Musain.\n\nEnjolras said, mixing his words with a few half-enigmatical but\nsignificant metaphors:--\n\n\"It is proper that we should know where we stand and on whom we may\ncount. If combatants are required, they must be provided. It can do no\nharm to have something with which to strike. Passers-by always have more\nchance of being gored when there are bulls on the road than when there\nare none. Let us, therefore, reckon a little on the herd. How many of us\nare there? There is no question of postponing this task until to-morrow.\nRevolutionists should always be hurried; progress has no time to lose.\nLet us mistrust the unexpected. Let us not be caught unprepared. We must\ngo over all the seams that we have made and see whether they hold fast.\nThis business ought to be concluded to-day. Courfeyrac, you will see the\npolytechnic students. It is their day to go out. To-day is Wednesday.\nFeuilly, you will see those of the Glaciere, will you not? Combeferre\nhas promised me to go to Picpus. There is a perfect swarm and an\nexcellent one there. Bahorel will visit the Estrapade. Prouvaire, the\nmasons are growing lukewarm; you will bring us news from the lodge of\nthe Rue de Grenelle-Saint-Honore. Joly will go to Dupuytren's clinical\nlecture, and feel the pulse of the medical school. Bossuet will take a\nlittle turn in the court and talk with the young law licentiates. I will\ntake charge of the Cougourde myself.\"\n\n\"That arranges everything,\" said Courfeyrac.\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"What else is there?\"\n\n\"A very important thing.\"\n\n\"What is that?\" asked Courfeyrac.\n\n\"The Barriere du Maine,\" replied Enjolras.\n\nEnjolras remained for a moment as though absorbed in reflection, then he\nresumed:--\n\n\"At the Barriere du Maine there are marble-workers, painters, and\njourneymen in the studios of sculptors. They are an enthusiastic family,\nbut liable to cool off. I don't know what has been the matter with\nthem for some time past. They are thinking of something else. They are\nbecoming extinguished. They pass their time playing dominoes. There is\nurgent need that some one should go and talk with them a little, but\nwith firmness. They meet at Richefeu's. They are to be found there\nbetween twelve and one o'clock. Those ashes must be fanned into a glow.\nFor that errand I had counted on that abstracted Marius, who is a good\nfellow on the whole, but he no longer comes to us. I need some one for\nthe Barriere du Maine. I have no one.\"\n\n\"What about me?\" said Grantaire. \"Here am I.\"\n\n\"You?\"\n\n\"I.\"\n\n\"You indoctrinate republicans! you warm up hearts that have grown cold\nin the name of principle!\"\n\n\"Why not?\"\n\n\"Are you good for anything?\"\n\n\"I have a vague ambition in that direction,\" said Grantaire.\n\n\"You do not believe in everything.\"\n\n\"I believe in you.\"\n\n\"Grantaire will you do me a service?\"\n\n\"Anything. I'll black your boots.\"\n\n\"Well, don't meddle with our affairs. Sleep yourself sober from your\nabsinthe.\"\n\n\"You are an ingrate, Enjolras.\"\n\n\"You the man to go to the Barriere du Maine! You capable of it!\"\n\n\"I am capable of descending the Rue de Gres, of crossing the Place\nSaint-Michel, of sloping through the Rue Monsieur-le-Prince, of taking\nthe Rue de Vaugirard, of passing the Carmelites, of turning into the Rue\nd'Assas, of reaching the Rue du Cherche-Midi, of leaving behind me the\nConseil de Guerre, of pacing the Rue des Vielles Tuileries, of striding\nacross the boulevard, of following the Chaussee du Maine, of passing\nthe barrier, and entering Richefeu's. I am capable of that. My shoes are\ncapable of that.\"\n\n\"Do you know anything of those comrades who meet at Richefeu's?\"\n\n\"Not much. We only address each other as thou.\"\n\n\"What will you say to them?\"\n\n\"I will speak to them of Robespierre, pardi! Of Danton. Of principles.\"\n\n\"You?\"\n\n\"I. But I don't receive justice. When I set about it, I am terrible. I\nhave read Prudhomme, I know the Social Contract, I know my constitution\nof the year Two by heart. 'The liberty of one citizen ends where the\nliberty of another citizen begins.' Do you take me for a brute? I have\nan old bank-bill of the Republic in my drawer. The Rights of Man, the\nsovereignty of the people, sapristi! I am even a bit of a Hebertist. I\ncan talk the most superb twaddle for six hours by the clock, watch in\nhand.\"\n\n\"Be serious,\" said Enjolras.\n\n\"I am wild,\" replied Grantaire.\n\nEnjolras meditated for a few moments, and made the gesture of a man who\nhas taken a resolution.\n\n\"Grantaire,\" he said gravely, \"I consent to try you. You shall go to the\nBarriere du Maine.\"\n\nGrantaire lived in furnished lodgings very near the Cafe Musain. He went\nout, and five minutes later he returned. He had gone home to put on a\nRobespierre waistcoat.\n\n\"Red,\" said he as he entered, and he looked intently at Enjolras. Then,\nwith the palm of his energetic hand, he laid the two scarlet points of\nthe waistcoat across his breast.\n\nAnd stepping up to Enjolras, he whispered in his ear:--\n\n\"Be easy.\"\n\nHe jammed his hat on resolutely and departed.\n\nA quarter of an hour later, the back room of the Cafe Musain was\ndeserted. All the friends of the A B C were gone, each in his own\ndirection, each to his own task. Enjolras, who had reserved the\nCougourde of Aix for himself, was the last to leave.\n\nThose members of the Cougourde of Aix who were in Paris then met on the\nplain of Issy, in one of the abandoned quarries which are so numerous in\nthat side of Paris.\n\nAs Enjolras walked towards this place, he passed the whole situation\nin review in his own mind. The gravity of events was self-evident. When\nfacts, the premonitory symptoms of latent social malady, move heavily,\nthe slightest complication stops and entangles them. A phenomenon whence\narises ruin and new births. Enjolras descried a luminous uplifting\nbeneath the gloomy skirts of the future. Who knows? Perhaps the moment\nwas at hand. The people were again taking possession of right, and\nwhat a fine spectacle! The revolution was again majestically taking\npossession of France and saying to the world: \"The sequel to-morrow!\"\nEnjolras was content. The furnace was being heated. He had at that\nmoment a powder train of friends scattered all over Paris. He composed,\nin his own mind, with Combeferre's philosophical and penetrating\neloquence, Feuilly's cosmopolitan enthusiasm, Courfeyrac's dash,\nBahorel's smile, Jean Prouvaire's melancholy, Joly's science, Bossuet's\nsarcasms, a sort of electric spark which took fire nearly everywhere at\nonce. All hands to work. Surely, the result would answer to the effort.\nThis was well. This made him think of Grantaire.\n\n\"Hold,\" said he to himself, \"the Barriere du Maine will not take me far\nout of my way. What if I were to go on as far as Richefeu's? Let us have\na look at what Grantaire is about, and see how he is getting on.\"\n\nOne o'clock was striking from the Vaugirard steeple when Enjolras\nreached the Richefeu smoking-room.\n\nHe pushed open the door, entered, folded his arms, letting the door fall\nto and strike his shoulders, and gazed at that room filled with tables,\nmen, and smoke.\n\nA voice broke forth from the mist of smoke, interrupted by another\nvoice. It was Grantaire holding a dialogue with an adversary.\n\nGrantaire was sitting opposite another figure, at a marble Saint-Anne\ntable, strewn with grains of bran and dotted with dominos. He was\nhammering the table with his fist, and this is what Enjolras heard:--\n\n\"Double-six.\"\n\n\"Fours.\"\n\n\"The pig! I have no more.\"\n\n\"You are dead. A two.\"\n\n\"Six.\"\n\n\"Three.\"\n\n\"One.\"\n\n\"It's my move.\"\n\n\"Four points.\"\n\n\"Not much.\"\n\n\"It's your turn.\"\n\n\"I have made an enormous mistake.\"\n\n\"You are doing well.\"\n\n\"Fifteen.\"\n\n\"Seven more.\"\n\n\"That makes me twenty-two.\" [Thoughtfully, \"Twenty-two!\"]\n\n\"You weren't expecting that double-six. If I had placed it at the\nbeginning, the whole play would have been changed.\"\n\n\"A two again.\"\n\n\"One.\"\n\n\"One! Well, five.\"\n\n\"I haven't any.\"\n\n\"It was your play, I believe?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Blank.\"\n\n\"What luck he has! Ah! You are lucky! [Long revery.] Two.\"\n\n\"One.\"\n\n\"Neither five nor one. That's bad for you.\"\n\n\"Domino.\"\n\n\"Plague take it!\"\n\n\n\n\nBOOK SECOND.--EPONINE\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I--THE LARK'S MEADOW\n\nMarius had witnessed the unexpected termination of the ambush upon whose\ntrack he had set Javert; but Javert had no sooner quitted the building,\nbearing off his prisoners in three hackney-coaches, than Marius also\nglided out of the house. It was only nine o'clock in the evening. Marius\nbetook himself to Courfeyrac. Courfeyrac was no longer the imperturbable\ninhabitant of the Latin Quarter, he had gone to live in the Rue de la\nVerrerie \"for political reasons\"; this quarter was one where, at that\nepoch, insurrection liked to install itself. Marius said to Courfeyrac:\n\"I have come to sleep with you.\" Courfeyrac dragged a mattress off his\nbed, which was furnished with two, spread it out on the floor, and said:\n\"There.\"\n\nAt seven o'clock on the following morning, Marius returned to the hovel,\npaid the quarter's rent which he owed to Ma'am Bougon, had his books,\nhis bed, his table, his commode, and his two chairs loaded on a\nhand-cart and went off without leaving his address, so that when Javert\nreturned in the course of the morning, for the purpose of questioning\nMarius as to the events of the preceding evening, he found only Ma'am\nBougon, who answered: \"Moved away!\"\n\nMa'am Bougon was convinced that Marius was to some extent an accomplice\nof the robbers who had been seized the night before. \"Who would ever\nhave said it?\" she exclaimed to the portresses of the quarter, \"a young\nman like that, who had the air of a girl!\"\n\nMarius had two reasons for this prompt change of residence. The first\nwas, that he now had a horror of that house, where he had beheld, so\nclose at hand, and in its most repulsive and most ferocious development,\na social deformity which is, perhaps, even more terrible than the wicked\nrich man, the wicked poor man. The second was, that he did not wish\nto figure in the lawsuit which would insue in all probability, and be\nbrought in to testify against Thenardier.\n\nJavert thought that the young man, whose name he had forgotten, was\nafraid, and had fled, or perhaps, had not even returned home at the time\nof the ambush; he made some efforts to find him, however, but without\nsuccess.\n\nA month passed, then another. Marius was still with Courfeyrac. He had\nlearned from a young licentiate in law, an habitual frequenter of the\ncourts, that Thenardier was in close confinement. Every Monday,\nMarius had five francs handed in to the clerk's office of La Force for\nThenardier.\n\nAs Marius had no longer any money, he borrowed the five francs from\nCourfeyrac. It was the first time in his life that he had ever borrowed\nmoney. These periodical five francs were a double riddle to Courfeyrac\nwho lent and to Thenardier who received them. \"To whom can they go?\"\nthought Courfeyrac. \"Whence can this come to me?\" Thenardier asked\nhimself.\n\nMoreover, Marius was heart-broken. Everything had plunged through a\ntrap-door once more. He no longer saw anything before him; his life\nwas again buried in mystery where he wandered fumblingly. He had for a\nmoment beheld very close at hand, in that obscurity, the young girl whom\nhe loved, the old man who seemed to be her father, those unknown beings,\nwho were his only interest and his only hope in this world; and, at the\nvery moment when he thought himself on the point of grasping them, a\ngust had swept all these shadows away. Not a spark of certainty and\ntruth had been emitted even in the most terrible of collisions. No\nconjecture was possible. He no longer knew even the name that he thought\nhe knew. It certainly was not Ursule. And the Lark was a nickname. And\nwhat was he to think of the old man? Was he actually in hiding from\nthe police? The white-haired workman whom Marius had encountered in the\nvicinity of the Invalides recurred to his mind. It now seemed probable\nthat that workingman and M. Leblanc were one and the same person. So he\ndisguised himself? That man had his heroic and his equivocal sides. Why\nhad he not called for help? Why had he fled? Was he, or was he not,\nthe father of the young girl? Was he, in short, the man whom Thenardier\nthought that he recognized? Thenardier might have been mistaken. These\nformed so many insoluble problems. All this, it is true, detracted\nnothing from the angelic charms of the young girl of the Luxembourg.\nHeart-rending distress; Marius bore a passion in his heart, and night\nover his eyes. He was thrust onward, he was drawn, and he could not\nstir. All had vanished, save love. Of love itself he had lost the\ninstincts and the sudden illuminations. Ordinarily, this flame which\nburns us lights us also a little, and casts some useful gleams without.\nBut Marius no longer even heard these mute counsels of passion. He never\nsaid to himself: \"What if I were to go to such a place? What if I were\nto try such and such a thing?\" The girl whom he could no longer call\nUrsule was evidently somewhere; nothing warned Marius in what direction\nhe should seek her. His whole life was now summed up in two words;\nabsolute uncertainty within an impenetrable fog. To see her once again;\nhe still aspired to this, but he no longer expected it.\n\nTo crown all, his poverty had returned. He felt that icy breath close to\nhim, on his heels. In the midst of his torments, and long before\nthis, he had discontinued his work, and nothing is more dangerous than\ndiscontinued work; it is a habit which vanishes. A habit which is easy\nto get rid of, and difficult to take up again.\n\nA certain amount of dreaming is good, like a narcotic in discreet doses.\nIt lulls to sleep the fevers of the mind at labor, which are sometimes\nsevere, and produces in the spirit a soft and fresh vapor which corrects\nthe over-harsh contours of pure thought, fills in gaps here and there,\nbinds together and rounds off the angles of the ideas. But too much\ndreaming sinks and drowns. Woe to the brain-worker who allows himself to\nfall entirely from thought into revery! He thinks that he can re-ascend\nwith equal ease, and he tells himself that, after all, it is the same\nthing. Error!\n\nThought is the toil of the intelligence, revery its voluptuousness. To\nreplace thought with revery is to confound a poison with a food.\n\nMarius had begun in that way, as the reader will remember. Passion had\nsupervened and had finished the work of precipitating him into chimaeras\nwithout object or bottom. One no longer emerges from one's self except\nfor the purpose of going off to dream. Idle production. Tumultuous and\nstagnant gulf. And, in proportion as labor diminishes, needs increase.\nThis is a law. Man, in a state of revery, is generally prodigal and\nslack; the unstrung mind cannot hold life within close bounds.\n\nThere is, in that mode of life, good mingled with evil, for if\nenervation is baleful, generosity is good and healthful. But the poor\nman who is generous and noble, and who does not work, is lost. Resources\nare exhausted, needs crop up.\n\nFatal declivity down which the most honest and the firmest as well as\nthe most feeble and most vicious are drawn, and which ends in one of two\nholds, suicide or crime.\n\nBy dint of going outdoors to think, the day comes when one goes out to\nthrow one's self in the water.\n\nExcess of revery breeds men like Escousse and Lebras.\n\nMarius was descending this declivity at a slow pace, with his eyes\nfixed on the girl whom he no longer saw. What we have just written seems\nstrange, and yet it is true. The memory of an absent being kindles in\nthe darkness of the heart; the more it has disappeared, the more it\nbeams; the gloomy and despairing soul sees this light on its horizon;\nthe star of the inner night. She--that was Marius' whole thought. He\nmeditated of nothing else; he was confusedly conscious that his old coat\nwas becoming an impossible coat, and that his new coat was growing old,\nthat his shirts were wearing out, that his hat was wearing out, that his\nboots were giving out, and he said to himself: \"If I could but see her\nonce again before I die!\"\n\nOne sweet idea alone was left to him, that she had loved him, that her\nglance had told him so, that she did not know his name, but that she did\nknow his soul, and that, wherever she was, however mysterious the place,\nshe still loved him perhaps. Who knows whether she were not thinking of\nhim as he was thinking of her? Sometimes, in those inexplicable hours\nsuch as are experienced by every heart that loves, though he had no\nreasons for anything but sadness and yet felt an obscure quiver of joy,\nhe said to himself: \"It is her thoughts that are coming to me!\" Then he\nadded: \"Perhaps my thoughts reach her also.\"\n\nThis illusion, at which he shook his head a moment later, was\nsufficient, nevertheless, to throw beams, which at times resembled hope,\ninto his soul. From time to time, especially at that evening hour which\nis the most depressing to even the dreamy, he allowed the purest, the\nmost impersonal, the most ideal of the reveries which filled his brain,\nto fall upon a notebook which contained nothing else. He called this\n\"writing to her.\"\n\nIt must not be supposed that his reason was deranged. Quite the\ncontrary. He had lost the faculty of working and of moving firmly\ntowards any fixed goal, but he was endowed with more clear-sightedness\nand rectitude than ever. Marius surveyed by a calm and real, although\npeculiar light, what passed before his eyes, even the most indifferent\ndeeds and men; he pronounced a just criticism on everything with a sort\nof honest dejection and candid disinterestedness. His judgment, which\nwas almost wholly disassociated from hope, held itself aloof and soared\non high.\n\nIn this state of mind nothing escaped him, nothing deceived him, and\nevery moment he was discovering the foundation of life, of humanity, and\nof destiny. Happy, even in the midst of anguish, is he to whom God has\ngiven a soul worthy of love and of unhappiness! He who has not viewed\nthe things of this world and the heart of man under this double light\nhas seen nothing and knows nothing of the true.\n\nThe soul which loves and suffers is in a state of sublimity.\n\nHowever, day followed day, and nothing new presented itself. It\nmerely seemed to him, that the sombre space which still remained to be\ntraversed by him was growing shorter with every instant. He thought that\nhe already distinctly perceived the brink of the bottomless abyss.\n\n\"What!\" he repeated to himself, \"shall I not see her again before then!\"\n\nWhen you have ascended the Rue Saint-Jacques, left the barrier on one\nside and followed the old inner boulevard for some distance, you reach\nthe Rue de la Sante, then the Glaciere, and, a little while before\narriving at the little river of the Gobelins, you come to a sort of\nfield which is the only spot in the long and monotonous chain of the\nboulevards of Paris, where Ruysdeel would be tempted to sit down.\n\nThere is something indescribable there which exhales grace, a green\nmeadow traversed by tightly stretched lines, from which flutter rags\ndrying in the wind, and an old market-gardener's house, built in the\ntime of Louis XIII., with its great roof oddly pierced with dormer\nwindows, dilapidated palisades, a little water amid poplar-trees,\nwomen, voices, laughter; on the horizon the Pantheon, the pole of\nthe Deaf-Mutes, the Val-de-Grace, black, squat, fantastic, amusing,\nmagnificent, and in the background, the severe square crests of the\ntowers of Notre Dame.\n\nAs the place is worth looking at, no one goes thither. Hardly one cart\nor wagoner passes in a quarter of an hour.\n\nIt chanced that Marius' solitary strolls led him to this plot of\nground, near the water. That day, there was a rarity on the boulevard,\na passer-by. Marius, vaguely impressed with the almost savage beauty of\nthe place, asked this passer-by:--\"What is the name of this spot?\"\n\nThe person replied: \"It is the Lark's meadow.\"\n\nAnd he added: \"It was here that Ulbach killed the shepherdess of Ivry.\"\n\nBut after the word \"Lark\" Marius heard nothing more. These sudden\ncongealments in the state of revery, which a single word suffices to\nevoke, do occur. The entire thought is abruptly condensed around an\nidea, and it is no longer capable of perceiving anything else.\n\nThe Lark was the appellation which had replaced Ursule in the depths of\nMarius' melancholy.--\"Stop,\" said he with a sort of unreasoning stupor\npeculiar to these mysterious asides, \"this is her meadow. I shall know\nwhere she lives now.\"\n\nIt was absurd, but irresistible.\n\nAnd every day he returned to that meadow of the Lark.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II--EMBRYONIC FORMATION OF CRIMES IN THE INCUBATION OF PRISONS\n\nJavert's triumph in the Gorbeau hovel seemed complete, but had not been\nso.\n\nIn the first place, and this constituted the principal anxiety, Javert\nhad not taken the prisoner prisoner. The assassinated man who flees\nis more suspicious than the assassin, and it is probable that this\npersonage, who had been so precious a capture for the ruffians, would be\nno less fine a prize for the authorities.\n\nAnd then, Montparnasse had escaped Javert.\n\nAnother opportunity of laying hands on that \"devil's dandy\" must be\nwaited for. Montparnasse had, in fact, encountered Eponine as she stood\non the watch under the trees of the boulevard, and had led her off,\npreferring to play Nemorin with the daughter rather than Schinderhannes\nwith the father. It was well that he did so. He was free. As for\nEponine, Javert had caused her to be seized; a mediocre consolation.\nEponine had joined Azelma at Les Madelonettes.\n\nAnd finally, on the way from the Gorbeau house to La Force, one of the\nprincipal prisoners, Claquesous, had been lost. It was not known how\nthis had been effected, the police agents and the sergeants \"could\nnot understand it at all.\" He had converted himself into vapor, he had\nslipped through the handcuffs, he had trickled through the crevices of\nthe carriage, the fiacre was cracked, and he had fled; all that they\nwere able to say was, that on arriving at the prison, there was no\nClaquesous. Either the fairies or the police had had a hand in it. Had\nClaquesous melted into the shadows like a snow-flake in water? Had there\nbeen unavowed connivance of the police agents? Did this man belong\nto the double enigma of order and disorder? Was he concentric with\ninfraction and repression? Had this sphinx his fore paws in crime and\nhis hind paws in authority? Javert did not accept such comminations, and\nwould have bristled up against such compromises; but his squad included\nother inspectors besides himself, who were more initiated than he,\nperhaps, although they were his subordinates in the secrets of the\nPrefecture, and Claquesous had been such a villain that he might make\na very good agent. It is an excellent thing for ruffianism and an\nadmirable thing for the police to be on such intimate juggling terms\nwith the night. These double-edged rascals do exist. However that may\nbe, Claquesous had gone astray and was not found again. Javert appeared\nto be more irritated than amazed at this.\n\nAs for Marius, \"that booby of a lawyer,\" who had probably become\nfrightened, and whose name Javert had forgotten, Javert attached very\nlittle importance to him. Moreover, a lawyer can be hunted up at any\ntime. But was he a lawyer after all?\n\nThe investigation had begun.\n\nThe magistrate had thought it advisable not to put one of these men of\nthe band of Patron Minette in close confinement, in the hope that he\nwould chatter. This man was Brujon, the long-haired man of the Rue du\nPetit-Banquier. He had been let loose in the Charlemagne courtyard, and\nthe eyes of the watchers were fixed on him.\n\nThis name of Brujon is one of the souvenirs of La Force. In that hideous\ncourtyard, called the court of the Batiment-Neuf (New Building), which\nthe administration called the court Saint-Bernard, and which the robbers\ncalled the Fosseaux-Lions (The Lion's Ditch), on that wall covered with\nscales and leprosy, which rose on the left to a level with the roofs,\nnear an old door of rusty iron which led to the ancient chapel of the\nducal residence of La Force, then turned in a dormitory for ruffians,\nthere could still be seen, twelve years ago, a sort of fortress roughly\ncarved in the stone with a nail, and beneath it this signature:--\n\n                       BRUJON, 1811.\n\n\nThe Brujon of 1811 was the father of the Brujon of 1832.\n\nThe latter, of whom the reader caught but a glimpse at the Gorbeau\nhouse, was a very cunning and very adroit young spark, with a bewildered\nand plaintive air. It was in consequence of this plaintive air that the\nmagistrate had released him, thinking him more useful in the Charlemagne\nyard than in close confinement.\n\nRobbers do not interrupt their profession because they are in the hands\nof justice. They do not let themselves be put out by such a trifle as\nthat. To be in prison for one crime is no reason for not beginning on\nanother crime. They are artists, who have one picture in the salon, and\nwho toil, none the less, on a new work in their studios.\n\nBrujon seemed to be stupefied by prison. He could sometimes be seen\nstanding by the hour together in front of the sutler's window in the\nCharlemagne yard, staring like an idiot at the sordid list of prices\nwhich began with: garlic, 62 centimes, and ended with: cigar, 5\ncentimes. Or he passed his time in trembling, chattering his teeth,\nsaying that he had a fever, and inquiring whether one of the eight and\ntwenty beds in the fever ward was vacant.\n\nAll at once, towards the end of February, 1832, it was discovered that\nBrujon, that somnolent fellow, had had three different commissions\nexecuted by the errand-men of the establishment, not under his own name,\nbut in the name of three of his comrades; and they had cost him in all\nfifty sous, an exorbitant outlay which attracted the attention of the\nprison corporal.\n\nInquiries were instituted, and on consulting the tariff of commissions\nposted in the convict's parlor, it was learned that the fifty sous could\nbe analyzed as follows: three commissions; one to the Pantheon, ten\nsous; one to Val-de-Grace, fifteen sous; and one to the Barriere de\nGrenelle, twenty-five sous. This last was the dearest of the whole\ntariff. Now, at the Pantheon, at the Val-de-Grace, and at the Barriere\nde Grenelle were situated the domiciles of the three very redoubtable\nprowlers of the barriers, Kruideniers, alias Bizarre, Glorieux, an\nex-convict, and Barre-Carosse, upon whom the attention of the police was\ndirected by this incident. It was thought that these men were members\nof Patron Minette; two of those leaders, Babet and Gueulemer, had been\ncaptured. It was supposed that the messages, which had been addressed,\nnot to houses, but to people who were waiting for them in the street,\nmust have contained information with regard to some crime that had been\nplotted. They were in possession of other indications; they laid hand on\nthe three prowlers, and supposed that they had circumvented some one or\nother of Brujon's machinations.\n\nAbout a week after these measures had been taken, one night, as the\nsuperintendent of the watch, who had been inspecting the lower dormitory\nin the Batiment-Neuf, was about to drop his chestnut in the box--this\nwas the means adopted to make sure that the watchmen performed their\nduties punctually; every hour a chestnut must be dropped into all the\nboxes nailed to the doors of the dormitories--a watchman looked through\nthe peep-hole of the dormitory and beheld Brujon sitting on his bed and\nwriting something by the light of the hall-lamp. The guardian entered,\nBrujon was put in a solitary cell for a month, but they were not able to\nseize what he had written. The police learned nothing further about it.\n\nWhat is certain is, that on the following morning, a \"postilion\"\nwas flung from the Charlemagne yard into the Lions' Ditch, over the\nfive-story building which separated the two court-yards.\n\nWhat prisoners call a \"postilion\" is a pellet of bread artistically\nmoulded, which is sent into Ireland, that is to say, over the roofs of a\nprison, from one courtyard to another. Etymology: over England; from one\nland to another; into Ireland. This little pellet falls in the yard. The\nman who picks it up opens it and finds in it a note addressed to some\nprisoner in that yard. If it is a prisoner who finds the treasure, he\nforwards the note to its destination; if it is a keeper, or one of the\nprisoners secretly sold who are called sheep in prisons and foxes in the\ngalleys, the note is taken to the office and handed over to the police.\n\nOn this occasion, the postilion reached its address, although the person\nto whom it was addressed was, at that moment, in solitary confinement.\nThis person was no other than Babet, one of the four heads of Patron\nMinette.\n\nThe postilion contained a roll of paper on which only these two lines\nwere written:--\n\n\"Babet. There is an affair in the Rue Plumet. A gate on a garden.\"\n\nThis is what Brujon had written the night before.\n\nIn spite of male and female searchers, Babet managed to pass the note on\nfrom La Force to the Salpetriere, to a \"good friend\" whom he had and who\nwas shut up there. This woman in turn transmitted the note to another\nwoman of her acquaintance, a certain Magnon, who was strongly suspected\nby the police, though not yet arrested. This Magnon, whose name the\nreader has already seen, had relations with the Thenardier, which will\nbe described in detail later on, and she could, by going to see Eponine,\nserve as a bridge between the Salpetriere and Les Madelonettes.\n\nIt happened, that at precisely that moment, as proofs were wanting\nin the investigation directed against Thenardier in the matter of his\ndaughters, Eponine and Azelma were released. When Eponine came out,\nMagnon, who was watching the gate of the Madelonettes, handed her\nBrujon's note to Babet, charging her to look into the matter.\n\nEponine went to the Rue Plumet, recognized the gate and the garden,\nobserved the house, spied, lurked, and, a few days later, brought to\nMagnon, who delivers in the Rue Clocheperce, a biscuit, which Magnon\ntransmitted to Babet's mistress in the Salpetriere. A biscuit, in the\nshady symbolism of prisons, signifies: Nothing to be done.\n\nSo that in less than a week from that time, as Brujon and Babet met in\nthe circle of La Force, the one on his way to the examination, the other\non his way from it:--\n\n\"Well?\" asked Brujon, \"the Rue P.?\"\n\n\"Biscuit,\" replied Babet. Thus did the foetus of crime engendered by\nBrujon in La Force miscarry.\n\nThis miscarriage had its consequences, however, which were perfectly\ndistinct from Brujon's programme. The reader will see what they were.\n\nOften when we think we are knotting one thread, we are tying quite\nanother.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III--APPARITION TO FATHER MABEUF\n\nMarius no longer went to see any one, but he sometimes encountered\nFather Mabeuf by chance.\n\nWhile Marius was slowly descending those melancholy steps which may be\ncalled the cellar stairs, and which lead to places without light, where\nthe happy can be heard walking overhead, M. Mabeuf was descending on his\nside.\n\nThe Flora of Cauteretz no longer sold at all. The experiments on indigo\nhad not been successful in the little garden of Austerlitz, which had\na bad exposure. M. Mabeuf could cultivate there only a few plants which\nlove shade and dampness. Nevertheless, he did not become discouraged. He\nhad obtained a corner in the Jardin des Plantes, with a good exposure,\nto make his trials with indigo \"at his own expense.\" For this purpose he\nhad pawned his copperplates of the Flora. He had reduced his breakfast\nto two eggs, and he left one of these for his old servant, to whom he\nhad paid no wages for the last fifteen months. And often his breakfast\nwas his only meal. He no longer smiled with his infantile smile, he had\ngrown morose and no longer received visitors. Marius did well not to\ndream of going thither. Sometimes, at the hour when M. Mabeuf was on his\nway to the Jardin des Plantes, the old man and the young man passed\neach other on the Boulevard de l'Hopital. They did not speak, and only\nexchanged a melancholy sign of the head. A heart-breaking thing it is\nthat there comes a moment when misery looses bonds! Two men who have\nbeen friends become two chance passers-by.\n\nRoyal the bookseller was dead. M. Mabeuf no longer knew his books,\nhis garden, or his indigo: these were the three forms which happiness,\npleasure, and hope had assumed for him. This sufficed him for his\nliving. He said to himself: \"When I shall have made my balls of blueing,\nI shall be rich, I will withdraw my copperplates from the pawn-shop,\nI will put my Flora in vogue again with trickery, plenty of money and\nadvertisements in the newspapers and I will buy, I know well where, a\ncopy of Pierre de Medine's Art de Naviguer, with wood-cuts, edition of\n1655.\" In the meantime, he toiled all day over his plot of indigo, and\nat night he returned home to water his garden, and to read his books. At\nthat epoch, M. Mabeuf was nearly eighty years of age.\n\nOne evening he had a singular apparition.\n\nHe had returned home while it was still broad daylight. Mother\nPlutarque, whose health was declining, was ill and in bed. He had dined\non a bone, on which a little meat lingered, and a bit of bread that he\nhad found on the kitchen table, and had seated himself on an overturned\nstone post, which took the place of a bench in his garden.\n\nNear this bench there rose, after the fashion in orchard-gardens, a sort\nof large chest, of beams and planks, much dilapidated, a rabbit-hutch on\nthe ground floor, a fruit-closet on the first. There was nothing in the\nhutch, but there were a few apples in the fruit-closet,--the remains of\nthe winter's provision.\n\nM. Mabeuf had set himself to turning over and reading, with the aid of\nhis glasses, two books of which he was passionately fond and in which,\na serious thing at his age, he was interested. His natural timidity\nrendered him accessible to the acceptance of superstitions in a certain\ndegree. The first of these books was the famous treatise of President\nDelancre, De l'inconstance des Demons; the other was a quarto by Mutor\nde la Rubaudiere, Sur les Diables de Vauvert et les Gobelins de la\nBievre. This last-mentioned old volume interested him all the more,\nbecause his garden had been one of the spots haunted by goblins in\nformer times. The twilight had begun to whiten what was on high and to\nblacken all below. As he read, over the top of the book which he held\nin his hand, Father Mabeuf was surveying his plants, and among others a\nmagnificent rhododendron which was one of his consolations; four days of\nheat, wind, and sun without a drop of rain, had passed; the stalks were\nbending, the buds drooping, the leaves falling; all this needed water,\nthe rhododendron was particularly sad. Father Mabeuf was one of those\npersons for whom plants have souls. The old man had toiled all day over\nhis indigo plot, he was worn out with fatigue, but he rose, laid\nhis books on the bench, and walked, all bent over and with tottering\nfootsteps, to the well, but when he had grasped the chain, he could not\neven draw it sufficiently to unhook it. Then he turned round and cast a\nglance of anguish toward heaven which was becoming studded with stars.\n\nThe evening had that serenity which overwhelms the troubles of man\nbeneath an indescribably mournful and eternal joy. The night promised to\nbe as arid as the day had been.\n\n\"Stars everywhere!\" thought the old man; \"not the tiniest cloud! Not a\ndrop of water!\"\n\nAnd his head, which had been upraised for a moment, fell back upon his\nbreast.\n\nHe raised it again, and once more looked at the sky, murmuring:--\n\n\"A tear of dew! A little pity!\"\n\nHe tried again to unhook the chain of the well, and could not.\n\nAt that moment, he heard a voice saying:--\n\n\"Father Mabeuf, would you like to have me water your garden for you?\"\n\nAt the same time, a noise as of a wild animal passing became audible\nin the hedge, and he beheld emerging from the shrubbery a sort of tall,\nslender girl, who drew herself up in front of him and stared boldly at\nhim. She had less the air of a human being than of a form which had just\nblossomed forth from the twilight.\n\nBefore Father Mabeuf, who was easily terrified, and who was, as we have\nsaid, quick to take alarm, was able to reply by a single syllable, this\nbeing, whose movements had a sort of odd abruptness in the darkness, had\nunhooked the chain, plunged in and withdrawn the bucket, and filled the\nwatering-pot, and the goodman beheld this apparition, which had bare\nfeet and a tattered petticoat, running about among the flower-beds\ndistributing life around her. The sound of the watering-pot on the\nleaves filled Father Mabeuf's soul with ecstasy. It seemed to him that\nthe rhododendron was happy now.\n\nThe first bucketful emptied, the girl drew a second, then a third. She\nwatered the whole garden.\n\nThere was something about her, as she thus ran about among paths, where\nher outline appeared perfectly black, waving her angular arms, and with\nher fichu all in rags, that resembled a bat.\n\nWhen she had finished, Father Mabeuf approached her with tears in his\neyes, and laid his hand on her brow.\n\n\"God will bless you,\" said he, \"you are an angel since you take care of\nthe flowers.\"\n\n\"No,\" she replied. \"I am the devil, but that's all the same to me.\"\n\nThe old man exclaimed, without either waiting for or hearing her\nresponse:--\n\n\"What a pity that I am so unhappy and so poor, and that I can do nothing\nfor you!\"\n\n\"You can do something,\" said she.\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"Tell me where M. Marius lives.\"\n\nThe old man did not understand. \"What Monsieur Marius?\"\n\nHe raised his glassy eyes and seemed to be seeking something that had\nvanished.\n\n\"A young man who used to come here.\"\n\nIn the meantime, M. Mabeuf had searched his memory.\n\n\"Ah! yes--\" he exclaimed. \"I know what you mean. Wait! Monsieur\nMarius--the Baron Marius Pontmercy, parbleu! He lives,--or rather, he no\nlonger lives,--ah well, I don't know.\"\n\nAs he spoke, he had bent over to train a branch of rhododendron, and he\ncontinued:--\n\n\"Hold, I know now. He very often passes along the boulevard, and goes in\nthe direction of the Glaciere, Rue Croulebarbe. The meadow of the Lark.\nGo there. It is not hard to meet him.\"\n\nWhen M. Mabeuf straightened himself up, there was no longer any one\nthere; the girl had disappeared.\n\nHe was decidedly terrified.\n\n\"Really,\" he thought, \"if my garden had not been watered, I should think\nthat she was a spirit.\"\n\nAn hour later, when he was in bed, it came back to him, and as he fell\nasleep, at that confused moment when thought, like that fabulous bird\nwhich changes itself into a fish in order to cross the sea, little by\nlittle assumes the form of a dream in order to traverse slumber, he said\nto himself in a bewildered way:--\n\n\"In sooth, that greatly resembles what Rubaudiere narrates of the\ngoblins. Could it have been a goblin?\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV--AN APPARITION TO MARIUS\n\nSome days after this visit of a \"spirit\" to Farmer Mabeuf, one\nmorning,--it was on a Monday, the day when Marius borrowed the\nhundred-sou piece from Courfeyrac for Thenardier--Marius had put this\ncoin in his pocket, and before carrying it to the clerk's office, he\nhad gone \"to take a little stroll,\" in the hope that this would make him\nwork on his return. It was always thus, however. As soon as he rose, he\nseated himself before a book and a sheet of paper in order to scribble\nsome translation; his task at that epoch consisted in turning into\nFrench a celebrated quarrel between Germans, the Gans and Savigny\ncontroversy; he took Savigny, he took Gans, read four lines, tried to\nwrite one, could not, saw a star between him and his paper, and rose\nfrom his chair, saying: \"I shall go out. That will put me in spirits.\"\n\nAnd off he went to the Lark's meadow.\n\nThere he beheld more than ever the star, and less than ever Savigny and\nGans.\n\nHe returned home, tried to take up his work again, and did not succeed;\nthere was no means of re-knotting a single one of the threads which\nwere broken in his brain; then he said to himself: \"I will not go out\nto-morrow. It prevents my working.\" And he went out every day.\n\nHe lived in the Lark's meadow more than in Courfeyrac's lodgings. That\nwas his real address: Boulevard de la Sante, at the seventh tree from\nthe Rue Croulebarbe.\n\nThat morning he had quitted the seventh tree and had seated himself on\nthe parapet of the River des Gobelins. A cheerful sunlight penetrated\nthe freshly unfolded and luminous leaves.\n\nHe was dreaming of \"Her.\" And his meditation turning to a reproach, fell\nback upon himself; he reflected dolefully on his idleness, his paralysis\nof soul, which was gaining on him, and of that night which was growing\nmore dense every moment before him, to such a point that he no longer\neven saw the sun.\n\nNevertheless, athwart this painful extrication of indistinct ideas which\nwas not even a monologue, so feeble had action become in him, and he\nhad no longer the force to care to despair, athwart this melancholy\nabsorption, sensations from without did reach him. He heard behind him,\nbeneath him, on both banks of the river, the laundresses of the Gobelins\nbeating their linen, and above his head, the birds chattering and\nsinging in the elm-trees. On the one hand, the sound of liberty, the\ncareless happiness of the leisure which has wings; on the other, the\nsound of toil. What caused him to meditate deeply, and almost reflect,\nwere two cheerful sounds.\n\nAll at once, in the midst of his dejected ecstasy, he heard a familiar\nvoice saying:--\n\n\"Come! Here he is!\"\n\nHe raised his eyes, and recognized that wretched child who had come to\nhim one morning, the elder of the Thenardier daughters, Eponine; he knew\nher name now. Strange to say, she had grown poorer and prettier,\ntwo steps which it had not seemed within her power to take. She had\naccomplished a double progress, towards the light and towards distress.\nShe was barefooted and in rags, as on the day when she had so resolutely\nentered his chamber, only her rags were two months older now, the holes\nwere larger, the tatters more sordid. It was the same harsh voice,\nthe same brow dimmed and wrinkled with tan, the same free, wild, and\nvacillating glance. She had besides, more than formerly, in her face\nthat indescribably terrified and lamentable something which sojourn in a\nprison adds to wretchedness.\n\nShe had bits of straw and hay in her hair, not like Ophelia through\nhaving gone mad from the contagion of Hamlet's madness, but because she\nhad slept in the loft of some stable.\n\nAnd in spite of it all, she was beautiful. What a star art thou, O\nyouth!\n\nIn the meantime, she had halted in front of Marius with a trace of joy\nin her livid countenance, and something which resembled a smile.\n\nShe stood for several moments as though incapable of speech.\n\n\"So I have met you at last!\" she said at length. \"Father Mabeuf was\nright, it was on this boulevard! How I have hunted for you! If you only\nknew! Do you know? I have been in the jug. A fortnight! They let me out!\nseeing that there was nothing against me, and that, moreover, I had not\nreached years of discretion. I lack two months of it. Oh! how I have\nhunted for you! These six weeks! So you don't live down there any more?\"\n\n\"No,\" said Marius.\n\n\"Ah! I understand. Because of that affair. Those take-downs are\ndisagreeable. You cleared out. Come now! Why do you wear old hats like\nthis! A young man like you ought to have fine clothes. Do you know,\nMonsieur Marius, Father Mabeuf calls you Baron Marius, I don't know\nwhat. It isn't true that you are a baron? Barons are old fellows, they\ngo to the Luxembourg, in front of the chateau, where there is the most\nsun, and they read the Quotidienne for a sou. I once carried a letter to\na baron of that sort. He was over a hundred years old. Say, where do you\nlive now?\"\n\nMarius made no reply.\n\n\"Ah!\" she went on, \"you have a hole in your shirt. I must sew it up for\nyou.\"\n\nShe resumed with an expression which gradually clouded over:--\n\n\"You don't seem glad to see me.\"\n\nMarius held his peace; she remained silent for a moment, then\nexclaimed:--\n\n\"But if I choose, nevertheless, I could force you to look glad!\"\n\n\"What?\" demanded Marius. \"What do you mean?\"\n\n\"Ah! you used to call me thou,\" she retorted.\n\n\"Well, then, what dost thou mean?\"\n\nShe bit her lips; she seemed to hesitate, as though a prey to some sort\nof inward conflict. At last she appeared to come to a decision.\n\n\"So much the worse, I don't care. You have a melancholy air, I want you\nto be pleased. Only promise me that you will smile. I want to see you\nsmile and hear you say: 'Ah, well, that's good.' Poor Mr. Marius! you\nknow? You promised me that you would give me anything I like--\"\n\n\"Yes! Only speak!\"\n\nShe looked Marius full in the eye, and said:--\n\n\"I have the address.\"\n\nMarius turned pale. All the blood flowed back to his heart.\n\n\"What address?\"\n\n\"The address that you asked me to get!\"\n\nShe added, as though with an effort:--\n\n\"The address--you know very well!\"\n\n\"Yes!\" stammered Marius.\n\n\"Of that young lady.\"\n\nThis word uttered, she sighed deeply.\n\nMarius sprang from the parapet on which he had been sitting and seized\nher hand distractedly.\n\n\"Oh! Well! lead me thither! Tell me! Ask of me anything you wish! Where\nis it?\"\n\n\"Come with me,\" she responded. \"I don't know the street or number very\nwell; it is in quite the other direction from here, but I know the house\nwell, I will take you to it.\"\n\nShe withdrew her hand and went on, in a tone which could have rent\nthe heart of an observer, but which did not even graze Marius in his\nintoxicated and ecstatic state:--\n\n\"Oh! how glad you are!\"\n\nA cloud swept across Marius' brow. He seized Eponine by the arm:--\n\n\"Swear one thing to me!\"\n\n\"Swear!\" said she, \"what does that mean? Come! You want me to swear?\"\n\nAnd she laughed.\n\n\"Your father! promise me, Eponine! Swear to me that you will not give\nthis address to your father!\"\n\nShe turned to him with a stupefied air.\n\n\"Eponine! How do you know that my name is Eponine?\"\n\n\"Promise what I tell you!\"\n\nBut she did not seem to hear him.\n\n\"That's nice! You have called me Eponine!\"\n\nMarius grasped both her arms at once.\n\n\"But answer me, in the name of Heaven! pay attention to what I am saying\nto you, swear to me that you will not tell your father this address that\nyou know!\"\n\n\"My father!\" said she. \"Ah yes, my father! Be at ease. He's in close\nconfinement. Besides, what do I care for my father!\"\n\n\"But you do not promise me!\" exclaimed Marius.\n\n\"Let go of me!\" she said, bursting into a laugh, \"how you do shake me!\nYes! Yes! I promise that! I swear that to you! What is that to me? I\nwill not tell my father the address. There! Is that right? Is that it?\"\n\n\"Nor to any one?\" said Marius.\n\n\"Nor to any one.\"\n\n\"Now,\" resumed Marius, \"take me there.\"\n\n\"Immediately?\"\n\n\"Immediately.\"\n\n\"Come along. Ah! how pleased he is!\" said she.\n\nAfter a few steps she halted.\n\n\"You are following me too closely, Monsieur Marius. Let me go on ahead,\nand follow me so, without seeming to do it. A nice young man like you\nmust not be seen with a woman like me.\"\n\nNo tongue can express all that lay in that word, woman, thus pronounced\nby that child.\n\nShe proceeded a dozen paces and then halted once more; Marius joined\nher. She addressed him sideways, and without turning towards him:--\n\n\"By the way, you know that you promised me something?\"\n\nMarius fumbled in his pocket. All that he owned in the world was the\nfive francs intended for Thenardier the father. He took them and laid\nthem in Eponine's hand.\n\nShe opened her fingers and let the coin fall to the ground, and gazed at\nhim with a gloomy air.\n\n\"I don't want your money,\" said she.\n\n\n\n\nBOOK THIRD.--THE HOUSE IN THE RUE PLUMET\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I--THE HOUSE WITH A SECRET\n\nAbout the middle of the last century, a chief justice in the Parliament\nof Paris having a mistress and concealing the fact, for at that period\nthe grand seignors displayed their mistresses, and the bourgeois\nconcealed them, had \"a little house\" built in the Faubourg\nSaint-Germain, in the deserted Rue Blomet, which is now called Rue\nPlumet, not far from the spot which was then designated as Combat des\nAnimaux.\n\nThis house was composed of a single-storied pavilion; two rooms on the\nground floor, two chambers on the first floor, a kitchen down stairs,\na boudoir up stairs, an attic under the roof, the whole preceded by a\ngarden with a large gate opening on the street. This garden was about\nan acre and a half in extent. This was all that could be seen by\npassers-by; but behind the pavilion there was a narrow courtyard, and\nat the end of the courtyard a low building consisting of two rooms and\na cellar, a sort of preparation destined to conceal a child and nurse\nin case of need. This building communicated in the rear by a masked\ndoor which opened by a secret spring, with a long, narrow, paved winding\ncorridor, open to the sky, hemmed in with two lofty walls, which, hidden\nwith wonderful art, and lost as it were between garden enclosures and\ncultivated land, all of whose angles and detours it followed, ended in\nanother door, also with a secret lock which opened a quarter of a league\naway, almost in another quarter, at the solitary extremity of the Rue du\nBabylone.\n\nThrough this the chief justice entered, so that even those who were\nspying on him and following him would merely have observed that the\njustice betook himself every day in a mysterious way somewhere, and\nwould never have suspected that to go to the Rue de Babylone was to go\nto the Rue Blomet. Thanks to clever purchasers of land, the magistrate\nhad been able to make a secret, sewer-like passage on his own property,\nand consequently, without interference. Later on, he had sold in little\nparcels, for gardens and market gardens, the lots of ground adjoining\nthe corridor, and the proprietors of these lots on both sides thought\nthey had a party wall before their eyes, and did not even suspect the\nlong, paved ribbon winding between two walls amid their flower-beds and\ntheir orchards. Only the birds beheld this curiosity. It is probable\nthat the linnets and tomtits of the last century gossiped a great deal\nabout the chief justice.\n\nThe pavilion, built of stone in the taste of Mansard, wainscoted and\nfurnished in the Watteau style, rocaille on the inside, old-fashioned\non the outside, walled in with a triple hedge of flowers, had something\ndiscreet, coquettish, and solemn about it, as befits a caprice of love\nand magistracy.\n\nThis house and corridor, which have now disappeared, were in existence\nfifteen years ago. In '93 a coppersmith had purchased the house with\nthe idea of demolishing it, but had not been able to pay the price; the\nnation made him bankrupt. So that it was the house which demolished the\ncoppersmith. After that, the house remained uninhabited, and fell slowly\nto ruin, as does every dwelling to which the presence of man does not\ncommunicate life. It had remained fitted with its old furniture, was\nalways for sale or to let, and the ten or a dozen people who passed\nthrough the Rue Plumet were warned of the fact by a yellow and illegible\nbit of writing which had hung on the garden wall since 1819.\n\nTowards the end of the Restoration, these same passers-by might have\nnoticed that the bill had disappeared, and even that the shutters on the\nfirst floor were open. The house was occupied, in fact. The windows had\nshort curtains, a sign that there was a woman about.\n\nIn the month of October, 1829, a man of a certain age had presented\nhimself and had hired the house just as it stood, including, of course,\nthe back building and the lane which ended in the Rue de Babylone. He\nhad had the secret openings of the two doors to this passage repaired.\nThe house, as we have just mentioned, was still very nearly furnished\nwith the justice's old fitting; the new tenant had ordered some\nrepairs, had added what was lacking here and there, had replaced the\npaving-stones in the yard, bricks in the floors, steps in the stairs,\nmissing bits in the inlaid floors and the glass in the lattice windows,\nand had finally installed himself there with a young girl and an elderly\nmaid-servant, without commotion, rather like a person who is slipping\nin than like a man who is entering his own house. The neighbors did not\ngossip about him, for the reason that there were no neighbors.\n\nThis unobtrusive tenant was Jean Valjean, the young girl was Cosette.\nThe servant was a woman named Toussaint, whom Jean Valjean had saved\nfrom the hospital and from wretchedness, and who was elderly, a\nstammerer, and from the provinces, three qualities which had decided\nJean Valjean to take her with him. He had hired the house under the name\nof M. Fauchelevent, independent gentleman. In all that has been\nrelated heretofore, the reader has, doubtless, been no less prompt than\nThenardier to recognize Jean Valjean.\n\nWhy had Jean Valjean quitted the convent of the Petit-Picpus? What had\nhappened?\n\nNothing had happened.\n\nIt will be remembered that Jean Valjean was happy in the convent, so\nhappy that his conscience finally took the alarm. He saw Cosette every\nday, he felt paternity spring up and develop within him more and more,\nhe brooded over the soul of that child, he said to himself that she\nwas his, that nothing could take her from him, that this would last\nindefinitely, that she would certainly become a nun, being thereto\ngently incited every day, that thus the convent was henceforth the\nuniverse for her as it was for him, that he should grow old there, and\nthat she would grow up there, that she would grow old there, and that\nhe should die there; that, in short, delightful hope, no separation\nwas possible. On reflecting upon this, he fell into perplexity. He\ninterrogated himself. He asked himself if all that happiness were\nreally his, if it were not composed of the happiness of another, of\nthe happiness of that child which he, an old man, was confiscating and\nstealing; if that were not theft? He said to himself, that this child\nhad a right to know life before renouncing it, that to deprive her in\nadvance, and in some sort without consulting her, of all joys, under\nthe pretext of saving her from all trials, to take advantage of her\nignorance of her isolation, in order to make an artificial vocation\ngerminate in her, was to rob a human creature of its nature and to lie\nto God. And who knows if, when she came to be aware of all this some\nday, and found herself a nun to her sorrow, Cosette would not come to\nhate him? A last, almost selfish thought, and less heroic than the rest,\nbut which was intolerable to him. He resolved to quit the convent.\n\nHe resolved on this; he recognized with anguish, the fact that it was\nnecessary. As for objections, there were none. Five years' sojourn\nbetween these four walls and of disappearance had necessarily destroyed\nor dispersed the elements of fear. He could return tranquilly among men.\nHe had grown old, and all had undergone a change. Who would recognize\nhim now? And then, to face the worst, there was danger only for himself,\nand he had no right to condemn Cosette to the cloister for the reason\nthat he had been condemned to the galleys. Besides, what is danger in\ncomparison with the right? Finally, nothing prevented his being prudent\nand taking his precautions.\n\nAs for Cosette's education, it was almost finished and complete.\n\nHis determination once taken, he awaited an opportunity. It was not long\nin presenting itself. Old Fauchelevent died.\n\nJean Valjean demanded an audience with the revered prioress and told her\nthat, having come into a little inheritance at the death of his brother,\nwhich permitted him henceforth to live without working, he should leave\nthe service of the convent and take his daughter with him; but that, as\nit was not just that Cosette, since she had not taken the vows, should\nhave received her education gratuitously, he humbly begged the Reverend\nPrioress to see fit that he should offer to the community, as indemnity,\nfor the five years which Cosette had spent there, the sum of five\nthousand francs.\n\nIt was thus that Jean Valjean quitted the convent of the Perpetual\nAdoration.\n\nOn leaving the convent, he took in his own arms the little valise the\nkey to which he still wore on his person, and would permit no porter to\ntouch it. This puzzled Cosette, because of the odor of embalming which\nproceeded from it.\n\nLet us state at once, that this trunk never quitted him more. He always\nhad it in his chamber. It was the first and only thing sometimes, that\nhe carried off in his moving when he moved about. Cosette laughed at it,\nand called this valise his inseparable, saying: \"I am jealous of it.\"\n\nNevertheless, Jean Valjean did not reappear in the open air without\nprofound anxiety.\n\nHe discovered the house in the Rue Plumet, and hid himself from\nsight there. Henceforth he was in the possession of the name:--Ultime\nFauchelevent.\n\nAt the same time he hired two other apartments in Paris, in order that\nhe might attract less attention than if he were to remain always in the\nsame quarter, and so that he could, at need, take himself off at the\nslightest disquietude which should assail him, and in short, so that\nhe might not again be caught unprovided as on the night when he had\nso miraculously escaped from Javert. These two apartments were very\npitiable, poor in appearance, and in two quarters which were far remote\nfrom each other, the one in the Rue de l'Ouest, the other in the Rue de\nl'Homme Arme.\n\nHe went from time to time, now to the Rue de l'Homme Arme, now to the\nRue de l'Ouest, to pass a month or six weeks, without taking Toussaint.\nHe had himself served by the porters, and gave himself out as a\ngentleman from the suburbs, living on his funds, and having a little\ntemporary resting-place in town. This lofty virtue had three domiciles\nin Paris for the sake of escaping from the police.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II--JEAN VALJEAN AS A NATIONAL GUARD\n\nHowever, properly speaking, he lived in the Rue Plumet, and he had\narranged his existence there in the following fashion:--\n\nCosette and the servant occupied the pavilion; she had the big\nsleeping-room with the painted pier-glasses, the boudoir with the gilded\nfillets, the justice's drawing-room furnished with tapestries and vast\narm-chairs; she had the garden. Jean Valjean had a canopied bed of\nantique damask in three colors and a beautiful Persian rug purchased in\nthe Rue du Figuier-Saint-Paul at Mother Gaucher's, put into Cosette's\nchamber, and, in order to redeem the severity of these magnificent\nold things, he had amalgamated with this bric-a-brac all the gay and\ngraceful little pieces of furniture suitable to young girls, an etagere,\na bookcase filled with gilt-edged books, an inkstand, a blotting-book,\npaper, a work-table incrusted with mother of pearl, a silver-gilt\ndressing-case, a toilet service in Japanese porcelain. Long damask\ncurtains with a red foundation and three colors, like those on the\nbed, hung at the windows of the first floor. On the ground floor, the\ncurtains were of tapestry. All winter long, Cosette's little house was\nheated from top to bottom. Jean Valjean inhabited the sort of porter's\nlodge which was situated at the end of the back courtyard, with a\nmattress on a folding-bed, a white wood table, two straw chairs, an\nearthenware water-jug, a few old volumes on a shelf, his beloved valise\nin one corner, and never any fire. He dined with Cosette, and he had a\nloaf of black bread on the table for his own use.\n\nWhen Toussaint came, he had said to her: \"It is the young lady who is\nthe mistress of this house.\"--\"And you, monsieur?\" Toussaint replied in\namazement.--\"I am a much better thing than the master, I am the father.\"\n\nCosette had been taught housekeeping in the convent, and she regulated\ntheir expenditure, which was very modest. Every day, Jean Valjean put\nhis arm through Cosette's and took her for a walk. He led her to the\nLuxembourg, to the least frequented walk, and every Sunday he took her\nto mass at Saint-Jacques-du-Haut-Pas, because that was a long way off.\nAs it was a very poor quarter, he bestowed alms largely there, and the\npoor people surrounded him in church, which had drawn down upon him\nThenardier's epistle: \"To the benevolent gentleman of the church of\nSaint-Jacques-du-Haut-Pas.\" He was fond of taking Cosette to visit the\npoor and the sick. No stranger ever entered the house in the Rue Plumet.\nToussaint brought their provisions, and Jean Valjean went himself for\nwater to a fountain near by on the boulevard. Their wood and wine were\nput into a half-subterranean hollow lined with rock-work which lay near\nthe Rue de Babylone and which had formerly served the chief-justice as\na grotto; for at the epoch of follies and \"Little Houses\" no love was\nwithout a grotto.\n\nIn the door opening on the Rue de Babylone, there was a box destined for\nthe reception of letters and papers; only, as the three inhabitants of\nthe pavilion in the Rue Plumet received neither papers nor letters, the\nentire usefulness of that box, formerly the go-between of a love\naffair, and the confidant of a love-lorn lawyer, was now limited to\nthe tax-collector's notices, and the summons of the guard. For M.\nFauchelevent, independent gentleman, belonged to the national guard;\nhe had not been able to escape through the fine meshes of the census of\n1831. The municipal information collected at that time had even reached\nthe convent of the Petit-Picpus, a sort of impenetrable and holy cloud,\nwhence Jean Valjean had emerged in venerable guise, and, consequently,\nworthy of mounting guard in the eyes of the townhall.\n\nThree or four times a year, Jean Valjean donned his uniform and mounted\nguard; he did this willingly, however; it was a correct disguise which\nmixed him with every one, and yet left him solitary. Jean Valjean had\njust attained his sixtieth birthday, the age of legal exemption; but he\ndid not appear to be over fifty; moreover, he had no desire to escape\nhis sergeant-major nor to quibble with Comte de Lobau; he possessed\nno civil status, he was concealing his name, he was concealing his\nidentity, so he concealed his age, he concealed everything; and, as we\nhave just said, he willingly did his duty as a national guard; the sum\nof his ambition lay in resembling any other man who paid his taxes. This\nman had for his ideal, within, the angel, without, the bourgeois.\n\nLet us note one detail, however; when Jean Valjean went out with\nCosette, he dressed as the reader has already seen, and had the air of\na retired officer. When he went out alone, which was generally at night,\nhe was always dressed in a workingman's trousers and blouse, and wore\na cap which concealed his face. Was this precaution or humility? Both.\nCosette was accustomed to the enigmatical side of her destiny, and\nhardly noticed her father's peculiarities. As for Toussaint, she\nvenerated Jean Valjean, and thought everything he did right.\n\nOne day, her butcher, who had caught a glimpse of Jean Valjean, said to\nher: \"That's a queer fish.\" She replied: \"He's a saint.\"\n\nNeither Jean Valjean nor Cosette nor Toussaint ever entered or emerged\nexcept by the door on the Rue de Babylone. Unless seen through the\ngarden gate it would have been difficult to guess that they lived in\nthe Rue Plumet. That gate was always closed. Jean Valjean had left the\ngarden uncultivated, in order not to attract attention.\n\nIn this, possibly, he made a mistake.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III--FOLIIS AC FRONDIBUS\n\nThe garden thus left to itself for more than half a century had become\nextraordinary and charming. The passers-by of forty years ago halted to\ngaze at it, without a suspicion of the secrets which it hid in its fresh\nand verdant depths. More than one dreamer of that epoch often allowed\nhis thoughts and his eyes to penetrate indiscreetly between the bars of\nthat ancient, padlocked gate, twisted, tottering, fastened to two\ngreen and moss-covered pillars, and oddly crowned with a pediment of\nundecipherable arabesque.\n\nThere was a stone bench in one corner, one or two mouldy statues,\nseveral lattices which had lost their nails with time, were rotting on\nthe wall, and there were no walks nor turf; but there was enough grass\neverywhere. Gardening had taken its departure, and nature had returned.\nWeeds abounded, which was a great piece of luck for a poor corner of\nland. The festival of gilliflowers was something splendid. Nothing\nin this garden obstructed the sacred effort of things towards life;\nvenerable growth reigned there among them. The trees had bent over\ntowards the nettles, the plant had sprung upward, the branch had\ninclined, that which crawls on the earth had gone in search of that\nwhich expands in the air, that which floats on the wind had bent over\ntowards that which trails in the moss; trunks, boughs, leaves, fibres,\nclusters, tendrils, shoots, spines, thorns, had mingled, crossed,\nmarried, confounded themselves in each other; vegetation in a deep\nand close embrace, had celebrated and accomplished there, under the\nwell-pleased eye of the Creator, in that enclosure three hundred feet\nsquare, the holy mystery of fraternity, symbol of the human fraternity.\nThis garden was no longer a garden, it was a colossal thicket, that is\nto say, something as impenetrable as a forest, as peopled as a city,\nquivering like a nest, sombre like a cathedral, fragrant like a bouquet,\nsolitary as a tomb, living as a throng.\n\nIn Floreal[34] this enormous thicket, free behind its gate and within\nits four walls, entered upon the secret labor of germination, quivered\nin the rising sun, almost like an animal which drinks in the breaths of\ncosmic love, and which feels the sap of April rising and boiling in\nits veins, and shakes to the wind its enormous wonderful green locks,\nsprinkled on the damp earth, on the defaced statues, on the crumbling\nsteps of the pavilion, and even on the pavement of the deserted street,\nflowers like stars, dew like pearls, fecundity, beauty, life, joy,\nperfumes. At midday, a thousand white butterflies took refuge there, and\nit was a divine spectacle to see that living summer snow whirling about\nthere in flakes amid the shade. There, in those gay shadows of verdure,\na throng of innocent voices spoke sweetly to the soul, and what the\ntwittering forgot to say the humming completed. In the evening, a dreamy\nvapor exhaled from the garden and enveloped it; a shroud of mist, a\ncalm and celestial sadness covered it; the intoxicating perfume of the\nhoneysuckles and convolvulus poured out from every part of it, like an\nexquisite and subtle poison; the last appeals of the woodpeckers and\nthe wagtails were audible as they dozed among the branches; one felt the\nsacred intimacy of the birds and the trees; by day the wings rejoice the\nleaves, by night the leaves protect the wings.\n\nIn winter the thicket was black, dripping, bristling, shivering, and\nallowed some glimpse of the house. Instead of flowers on the branches\nand dew in the flowers, the long silvery tracks of the snails were\nvisible on the cold, thick carpet of yellow leaves; but in any fashion,\nunder any aspect, at all seasons, spring, winter, summer, autumn, this\ntiny enclosure breathed forth melancholy, contemplation, solitude,\nliberty, the absence of man, the presence of God; and the rusty old gate\nhad the air of saying: \"This garden belongs to me.\"\n\nIt was of no avail that the pavements of Paris were there on every side,\nthe classic and splendid hotels of the Rue de Varennes a couple of paces\naway, the dome of the Invalides close at hand, the Chamber of Deputies\nnot far off; the carriages of the Rue de Bourgogne and of the Rue\nSaint-Dominique rumbled luxuriously, in vain, in the vicinity, in vain\ndid the yellow, brown, white, and red omnibuses cross each other's\ncourse at the neighboring cross-roads; the Rue Plumet was the desert;\nand the death of the former proprietors, the revolution which had passed\nover it, the crumbling away of ancient fortunes, absence, forgetfulness,\nforty years of abandonment and widowhood, had sufficed to restore to\nthis privileged spot ferns, mulleins, hemlock, yarrow, tall weeds, great\ncrimped plants, with large leaves of pale green cloth, lizards, beetles,\nuneasy and rapid insects; to cause to spring forth from the depths\nof the earth and to reappear between those four walls a certain\nindescribable and savage grandeur; and for nature, which disconcerts\nthe petty arrangements of man, and which sheds herself always thoroughly\nwhere she diffuses herself at all, in the ant as well as in the eagle,\nto blossom out in a petty little Parisian garden with as much rude force\nand majesty as in a virgin forest of the New World.\n\nNothing is small, in fact; any one who is subject to the profound\nand penetrating influence of nature knows this. Although no absolute\nsatisfaction is given to philosophy, either to circumscribe the cause\nor to limit the effect, the contemplator falls into those unfathomable\necstasies caused by these decompositions of force terminating in unity.\nEverything toils at everything.\n\nAlgebra is applied to the clouds; the radiation of the star profits\nthe rose; no thinker would venture to affirm that the perfume of the\nhawthorn is useless to the constellations. Who, then, can calculate the\ncourse of a molecule? How do we know that the creation of worlds is not\ndetermined by the fall of grains of sand? Who knows the reciprocal\nebb and flow of the infinitely great and the infinitely little, the\nreverberations of causes in the precipices of being, and the avalanches\nof creation? The tiniest worm is of importance; the great is little, the\nlittle is great; everything is balanced in necessity; alarming vision\nfor the mind. There are marvellous relations between beings and things;\nin that inexhaustible whole, from the sun to the grub, nothing despises\nthe other; all have need of each other. The light does not bear away\nterrestrial perfumes into the azure depths, without knowing what it is\ndoing; the night distributes stellar essences to the sleeping flowers.\nAll birds that fly have round their leg the thread of the infinite.\nGermination is complicated with the bursting forth of a meteor and with\nthe peck of a swallow cracking its egg, and it places on one level the\nbirth of an earthworm and the advent of Socrates. Where the telescope\nends, the microscope begins. Which of the two possesses the larger field\nof vision? Choose. A bit of mould is a pleiad of flowers; a nebula is an\nant-hill of stars. The same promiscuousness, and yet more unprecedented,\nexists between the things of the intelligence and the facts of\nsubstance. Elements and principles mingle, combine, wed, multiply with\neach other, to such a point that the material and the moral world are\nbrought eventually to the same clearness. The phenomenon is perpetually\nreturning upon itself. In the vast cosmic exchanges the universal life\ngoes and comes in unknown quantities, rolling entirely in the invisible\nmystery of effluvia, employing everything, not losing a single dream,\nnot a single slumber, sowing an animalcule here, crumbling to bits a\nplanet there, oscillating and winding, making of light a force and of\nthought an element, disseminated and invisible, dissolving all,\nexcept that geometrical point, the I; bringing everything back to the\nsoul-atom; expanding everything in God, entangling all activity, from\nsummit to base, in the obscurity of a dizzy mechanism, attaching the\nflight of an insect to the movement of the earth, subordinating, who\nknows? Were it only by the identity of the law, the evolution of the\ncomet in the firmament to the whirling of the infusoria in the drop\nof water. A machine made of mind. Enormous gearing, the prime motor of\nwhich is the gnat, and whose final wheel is the zodiac.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV--CHANGE OF GATE\n\nIt seemed that this garden, created in olden days to conceal wanton\nmysteries, had been transformed and become fitted to shelter chaste\nmysteries. There were no longer either arbors, or bowling greens, or\ntunnels, or grottos; there was a magnificent, dishevelled obscurity\nfalling like a veil over all. Paphos had been made over into Eden. It is\nimpossible to say what element of repentance had rendered this retreat\nwholesome. This flower-girl now offered her blossom to the soul. This\ncoquettish garden, formerly decidedly compromised, had returned to\nvirginity and modesty. A justice assisted by a gardener, a goodman who\nthought that he was a continuation of Lamoignon, and another goodman who\nthought that he was a continuation of Lenotre, had turned it about, cut,\nruffled, decked, moulded it to gallantry; nature had taken possession of\nit once more, had filled it with shade, and had arranged it for love.\n\nThere was, also, in this solitude, a heart which was quite ready. Love\nhad only to show himself; he had here a temple composed of verdure,\ngrass, moss, the sight of birds, tender shadows, agitated branches, and\na soul made of sweetness, of faith, of candor, of hope, of aspiration,\nand of illusion.\n\nCosette had left the convent when she was still almost a child; she was\na little more than fourteen, and she was at the \"ungrateful age\"; we\nhave already said, that with the exception of her eyes, she was homely\nrather than pretty; she had no ungraceful feature, but she was awkward,\nthin, timid and bold at once, a grown-up little girl, in short.\n\nHer education was finished, that is to say, she has been taught\nreligion, and even and above all, devotion; then \"history,\" that is to\nsay the thing that bears that name in convents, geography, grammar,\nthe participles, the kings of France, a little music, a little drawing,\netc.; but in all other respects she was utterly ignorant, which is a\ngreat charm and a great peril. The soul of a young girl should not be\nleft in the dark; later on, mirages that are too abrupt and too lively\nare formed there, as in a dark chamber. She should be gently and\ndiscreetly enlightened, rather with the reflection of realities than\nwith their harsh and direct light. A useful and graciously austere\nhalf-light which dissipates puerile fears and obviates falls. There is\nnothing but the maternal instinct, that admirable intuition composed of\nthe memories of the virgin and the experience of the woman, which knows\nhow this half-light is to be created and of what it should consist.\n\nNothing supplies the place of this instinct. All the nuns in the world\nare not worth as much as one mother in the formation of a young girl's\nsoul.\n\nCosette had had no mother. She had only had many mothers, in the plural.\n\nAs for Jean Valjean, he was, indeed, all tenderness, all solicitude; but\nhe was only an old man and he knew nothing at all.\n\nNow, in this work of education, in this grave matter of preparing a\nwoman for life, what science is required to combat that vast ignorance\nwhich is called innocence!\n\nNothing prepares a young girl for passions like the convent. The convent\nturns the thoughts in the direction of the unknown. The heart, thus\nthrown back upon itself, works downward within itself, since it cannot\noverflow, and grows deep, since it cannot expand. Hence visions,\nsuppositions, conjectures, outlines of romances, a desire for\nadventures, fantastic constructions, edifices built wholly in the inner\nobscurity of the mind, sombre and secret abodes where the passions\nimmediately find a lodgement as soon as the open gate permits them to\nenter. The convent is a compression which, in order to triumph over the\nhuman heart, should last during the whole life.\n\nOn quitting the convent, Cosette could have found nothing more sweet and\nmore dangerous than the house in the Rue Plumet. It was the continuation\nof solitude with the beginning of liberty; a garden that was closed, but\na nature that was acrid, rich, voluptuous, and fragrant; the same dreams\nas in the convent, but with glimpses of young men; a grating, but one\nthat opened on the street.\n\nStill, when she arrived there, we repeat, she was only a child. Jean\nValjean gave this neglected garden over to her. \"Do what you like with\nit,\" he said to her. This amused Cosette; she turned over all the clumps\nand all the stones, she hunted for \"beasts\"; she played in it, while\nawaiting the time when she would dream in it; she loved this garden\nfor the insects that she found beneath her feet amid the grass, while\nawaiting the day when she would love it for the stars that she would see\nthrough the boughs above her head.\n\nAnd then, she loved her father, that is to say, Jean Valjean, with\nall her soul, with an innocent filial passion which made the goodman\na beloved and charming companion to her. It will be remembered that M.\nMadeleine had been in the habit of reading a great deal. Jean Valjean\nhad continued this practice; he had come to converse well; he possessed\nthe secret riches and the eloquence of a true and humble mind which has\nspontaneously cultivated itself. He retained just enough sharpness to\nseason his kindness; his mind was rough and his heart was soft. During\ntheir conversations in the Luxembourg, he gave her explanations of\neverything, drawing on what he had read, and also on what he had\nsuffered. As she listened to him, Cosette's eyes wandered vaguely about.\n\nThis simple man sufficed for Cosette's thought, the same as the wild\ngarden sufficed for her eyes. When she had had a good chase after the\nbutterflies, she came panting up to him and said: \"Ah! How I have run!\"\nHe kissed her brow.\n\nCosette adored the goodman. She was always at his heels. Where Jean\nValjean was, there happiness was. Jean Valjean lived neither in the\npavilion nor the garden; she took greater pleasure in the paved back\ncourtyard, than in the enclosure filled with flowers, and in his little\nlodge furnished with straw-seated chairs than in the great drawing-room\nhung with tapestry, against which stood tufted easy-chairs. Jean Valjean\nsometimes said to her, smiling at his happiness in being importuned: \"Do\ngo to your own quarters! Leave me alone a little!\"\n\nShe gave him those charming and tender scoldings which are so graceful\nwhen they come from a daughter to her father.\n\n\"Father, I am very cold in your rooms; why don't you have a carpet here\nand a stove?\"\n\n\"Dear child, there are so many people who are better than I and who have\nnot even a roof over their heads.\"\n\n\"Then why is there a fire in my rooms, and everything that is needed?\"\n\n\"Because you are a woman and a child.\"\n\n\"Bah! must men be cold and feel uncomfortable?\"\n\n\"Certain men.\"\n\n\"That is good, I shall come here so often that you will be obliged to\nhave a fire.\"\n\nAnd again she said to him:--\n\n\"Father, why do you eat horrible bread like that?\"\n\n\"Because, my daughter.\"\n\n\"Well, if you eat it, I will eat it too.\"\n\nThen, in order to prevent Cosette eating black bread, Jean Valjean ate\nwhite bread.\n\nCosette had but a confused recollection of her childhood. She prayed\nmorning and evening for her mother whom she had never known. The\nThenardiers had remained with her as two hideous figures in a dream. She\nremembered that she had gone \"one day, at night,\" to fetch water in a\nforest. She thought that it had been very far from Paris. It seemed to\nher that she had begun to live in an abyss, and that it was Jean Valjean\nwho had rescued her from it. Her childhood produced upon her the effect\nof a time when there had been nothing around her but millepeds, spiders,\nand serpents. When she meditated in the evening, before falling asleep,\nas she had not a very clear idea that she was Jean Valjean's daughter,\nand that he was her father, she fancied that the soul of her mother had\npassed into that good man and had come to dwell near her.\n\nWhen he was seated, she leaned her cheek against his white hair, and\ndropped a silent tear, saying to herself: \"Perhaps this man is my\nmother.\"\n\nCosette, although this is a strange statement to make, in the profound\nignorance of a girl brought up in a convent,--maternity being also\nabsolutely unintelligible to virginity,--had ended by fancying that she\nhad had as little mother as possible. She did not even know her mother's\nname. Whenever she asked Jean Valjean, Jean Valjean remained silent. If\nshe repeated her question, he responded with a smile. Once she insisted;\nthe smile ended in a tear.\n\nThis silence on the part of Jean Valjean covered Fantine with darkness.\n\nWas it prudence? Was it respect? Was it a fear that he should deliver\nthis name to the hazards of another memory than his own?\n\nSo long as Cosette had been small, Jean Valjean had been willing to talk\nto her of her mother; when she became a young girl, it was impossible\nfor him to do so. It seemed to him that he no longer dared. Was it\nbecause of Cosette? Was it because of Fantine? He felt a certain\nreligious horror at letting that shadow enter Cosette's thought; and of\nplacing a third in their destiny. The more sacred this shade was to him,\nthe more did it seem that it was to be feared. He thought of Fantine,\nand felt himself overwhelmed with silence.\n\nThrough the darkness, he vaguely perceived something which appeared\nto have its finger on its lips. Had all the modesty which had been\nin Fantine, and which had violently quitted her during her lifetime,\nreturned to rest upon her after her death, to watch in indignation over\nthe peace of that dead woman, and in its shyness, to keep her in her\ngrave? Was Jean Valjean unconsciously submitting to the pressure? We\nwho believe in death, are not among the number who will reject this\nmysterious explanation.\n\nHence the impossibility of uttering, even for Cosette, that name of\nFantine.\n\nOne day Cosette said to him:--\n\n\"Father, I saw my mother in a dream last night. She had two big wings.\nMy mother must have been almost a saint during her life.\"\n\n\"Through martyrdom,\" replied Jean Valjean.\n\nHowever, Jean Valjean was happy.\n\nWhen Cosette went out with him, she leaned on his arm, proud and happy,\nin the plenitude of her heart. Jean Valjean felt his heart melt within\nhim with delight, at all these sparks of a tenderness so exclusive, so\nwholly satisfied with himself alone. The poor man trembled, inundated\nwith angelic joy; he declared to himself ecstatically that this would\nlast all their lives; he told himself that he really had not suffered\nsufficiently to merit so radiant a bliss, and he thanked God, in the\ndepths of his soul, for having permitted him to be loved thus, he, a\nwretch, by that innocent being.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V--THE ROSE PERCEIVES THAT IT IS AN ENGINE OF WAR\n\nOne day, Cosette chanced to look at herself in her mirror, and she said\nto herself: \"Really!\" It seemed to her almost that she was pretty. This\nthrew her in a singularly troubled state of mind. Up to that moment she\nhad never thought of her face. She saw herself in her mirror, but she\ndid not look at herself. And then, she had so often been told that she\nwas homely; Jean Valjean alone said gently: \"No indeed! no indeed!\" At\nall events, Cosette had always thought herself homely, and had grown up\nin that belief with the easy resignation of childhood. And here, all\nat once, was her mirror saying to her, as Jean Valjean had said: \"No\nindeed!\" That night, she did not sleep. \"What if I were pretty!\" she\nthought. \"How odd it would be if I were pretty!\" And she recalled those\nof her companions whose beauty had produced a sensation in the convent,\nand she said to herself: \"What! Am I to be like Mademoiselle So-and-So?\"\n\nThe next morning she looked at herself again, not by accident this time,\nand she was assailed with doubts: \"Where did I get such an idea?\" said\nshe; \"no, I am ugly.\" She had not slept well, that was all, her eyes\nwere sunken and she was pale. She had not felt very joyous on the\npreceding evening in the belief that she was beautiful, but it made her\nvery sad not to be able to believe in it any longer. She did not look at\nherself again, and for more than a fortnight she tried to dress her hair\nwith her back turned to the mirror.\n\nIn the evening, after dinner, she generally embroidered in wool or\ndid some convent needlework in the drawing-room, and Jean Valjean read\nbeside her. Once she raised her eyes from her work, and was rendered\nquite uneasy by the manner in which her father was gazing at her.\n\nOn another occasion, she was passing along the street, and it seemed\nto her that some one behind her, whom she did not see, said: \"A pretty\nwoman! but badly dressed.\" \"Bah!\" she thought, \"he does not mean me.\nI am well dressed and ugly.\" She was then wearing a plush hat and her\nmerino gown.\n\nAt last, one day when she was in the garden, she heard poor old\nToussaint saying: \"Do you notice how pretty Cosette is growing, sir?\"\nCosette did not hear her father's reply, but Toussaint's words caused\na sort of commotion within her. She fled from the garden, ran up to\nher room, flew to the looking-glass,--it was three months since she\nhad looked at herself,--and gave vent to a cry. She had just dazzled\nherself.\n\nShe was beautiful and lovely; she could not help agreeing with Toussaint\nand her mirror. Her figure was formed, her skin had grown white, her\nhair was lustrous, an unaccustomed splendor had been lighted in her blue\neyes. The consciousness of her beauty burst upon her in an instant, like\nthe sudden advent of daylight; other people noticed it also, Toussaint\nhad said so, it was evidently she of whom the passer-by had spoken,\nthere could no longer be any doubt of that; she descended to the garden\nagain, thinking herself a queen, imagining that she heard the birds\nsinging, though it was winter, seeing the sky gilded, the sun among\nthe trees, flowers in the thickets, distracted, wild, in inexpressible\ndelight.\n\nJean Valjean, on his side, experienced a deep and undefinable oppression\nat heart.\n\nIn fact, he had, for some time past, been contemplating with terror that\nbeauty which seemed to grow more radiant every day on Cosette's sweet\nface. The dawn that was smiling for all was gloomy for him.\n\nCosette had been beautiful for a tolerably long time before she became\naware of it herself. But, from the very first day, that unexpected light\nwhich was rising slowly and enveloping the whole of the young girl's\nperson, wounded Jean Valjean's sombre eye. He felt that it was a change\nin a happy life, a life so happy that he did not dare to move for fear\nof disarranging something. This man, who had passed through all manner\nof distresses, who was still all bleeding from the bruises of fate, who\nhad been almost wicked and who had become almost a saint, who, after\nhaving dragged the chain of the galleys, was now dragging the invisible\nbut heavy chain of indefinite misery, this man whom the law had not\nreleased from its grasp and who could be seized at any moment and\nbrought back from the obscurity of his virtue to the broad daylight of\npublic opprobrium, this man accepted all, excused all, pardoned all, and\nmerely asked of Providence, of man, of the law, of society, of nature,\nof the world, one thing, that Cosette might love him!\n\nThat Cosette might continue to love him! That God would not prevent\nthe heart of the child from coming to him, and from remaining with him!\nBeloved by Cosette, he felt that he was healed, rested, appeased, loaded\nwith benefits, recompensed, crowned. Beloved by Cosette, it was well\nwith him! He asked nothing more! Had any one said to him: \"Do you want\nanything better?\" he would have answered: \"No.\" God might have said to\nhim: \"Do you desire heaven?\" and he would have replied: \"I should lose\nby it.\"\n\nEverything which could affect this situation, if only on the surface,\nmade him shudder like the beginning of something new. He had never\nknown very distinctly himself what the beauty of a woman means; but he\nunderstood instinctively, that it was something terrible.\n\nHe gazed with terror on this beauty, which was blossoming out ever more\ntriumphant and superb beside him, beneath his very eyes, on the innocent\nand formidable brow of that child, from the depths of her homeliness, of\nhis old age, of his misery, of his reprobation.\n\nHe said to himself: \"How beautiful she is! What is to become of me?\"\n\nThere, moreover, lay the difference between his tenderness and the\ntenderness of a mother. What he beheld with anguish, a mother would have\ngazed upon with joy.\n\nThe first symptoms were not long in making their appearance.\n\nOn the very morrow of the day on which she had said to herself:\n\"Decidedly I am beautiful!\" Cosette began to pay attention to her\ntoilet. She recalled the remark of that passer-by: \"Pretty, but badly\ndressed,\" the breath of an oracle which had passed beside her and had\nvanished, after depositing in her heart one of the two germs which are\ndestined, later on, to fill the whole life of woman, coquetry. Love is\nthe other.\n\nWith faith in her beauty, the whole feminine soul expanded within her.\nShe conceived a horror for her merinos, and shame for her plush hat. Her\nfather had never refused her anything. She at once acquired the whole\nscience of the bonnet, the gown, the mantle, the boot, the cuff, the\nstuff which is in fashion, the color which is becoming, that science\nwhich makes of the Parisian woman something so charming, so deep, and so\ndangerous. The words heady woman were invented for the Parisienne.\n\nIn less than a month, little Cosette, in that Thebaid of the Rue de\nBabylone, was not only one of the prettiest, but one of the \"best\ndressed\" women in Paris, which means a great deal more.\n\nShe would have liked to encounter her \"passer-by,\" to see what he would\nsay, and to \"teach him a lesson!\" The truth is, that she was ravishing\nin every respect, and that she distinguished the difference between a\nbonnet from Gerard and one from Herbaut in the most marvellous way.\n\nJean Valjean watched these ravages with anxiety. He who felt that\nhe could never do anything but crawl, walk at the most, beheld wings\nsprouting on Cosette.\n\nMoreover, from the mere inspection of Cosette's toilet, a woman\nwould have recognized the fact that she had no mother. Certain little\nproprieties, certain special conventionalities, were not observed by\nCosette. A mother, for instance, would have told her that a young girl\ndoes not dress in damask.\n\nThe first day that Cosette went out in her black damask gown and mantle,\nand her white crape bonnet, she took Jean Valjean's arm, gay, radiant,\nrosy, proud, dazzling. \"Father,\" she said, \"how do you like me in this\nguise?\" Jean Valjean replied in a voice which resembled the bitter voice\nof an envious man: \"Charming!\" He was the same as usual during their\nwalk. On their return home, he asked Cosette:--\n\n\"Won't you put on that other gown and bonnet again,--you know the ones I\nmean?\"\n\nThis took place in Cosette's chamber. Cosette turned towards the\nwardrobe where her cast-off schoolgirl's clothes were hanging.\n\n\"That disguise!\" said she. \"Father, what do you want me to do with it?\nOh no, the idea! I shall never put on those horrors again. With that\nmachine on my head, I have the air of Madame Mad-dog.\"\n\nJean Valjean heaved a deep sigh.\n\nFrom that moment forth, he noticed that Cosette, who had always\nheretofore asked to remain at home, saying: \"Father, I enjoy myself more\nhere with you,\" now was always asking to go out. In fact, what is the\nuse of having a handsome face and a delicious costume if one does not\ndisplay them?\n\nHe also noticed that Cosette had no longer the same taste for the back\ngarden. Now she preferred the garden, and did not dislike to promenade\nback and forth in front of the railed fence. Jean Valjean, who was shy,\nnever set foot in the garden. He kept to his back yard, like a dog.\n\nCosette, in gaining the knowledge that she was beautiful, lost the grace\nof ignoring it. An exquisite grace, for beauty enhanced by ingenuousness\nis ineffable, and nothing is so adorable as a dazzling and innocent\ncreature who walks along, holding in her hand the key to paradise\nwithout being conscious of it. But what she had lost in ingenuous grace,\nshe gained in pensive and serious charm. Her whole person, permeated\nwith the joy of youth, of innocence, and of beauty, breathed forth a\nsplendid melancholy.\n\nIt was at this epoch that Marius, after the lapse of six months, saw her\nonce more at the Luxembourg.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI--THE BATTLE BEGUN\n\nCosette in her shadow, like Marius in his, was all ready to take fire.\nDestiny, with its mysterious and fatal patience, slowly drew together\nthese two beings, all charged and all languishing with the stormy\nelectricity of passion, these two souls which were laden with love as\ntwo clouds are laden with lightning, and which were bound to overflow\nand mingle in a look like the clouds in a flash of fire.\n\nThe glance has been so much abused in love romances that it has finally\nfallen into disrepute. One hardly dares to say, nowadays, that two\nbeings fell in love because they looked at each other. That is the way\npeople do fall in love, nevertheless, and the only way. The rest is\nnothing, but the rest comes afterwards. Nothing is more real than these\ngreat shocks which two souls convey to each other by the exchange of\nthat spark.\n\nAt that particular hour when Cosette unconsciously darted that glance\nwhich troubled Marius, Marius had no suspicion that he had also launched\na look which disturbed Cosette.\n\nHe caused her the same good and the same evil.\n\nShe had been in the habit of seeing him for a long time, and she had\nscrutinized him as girls scrutinize and see, while looking elsewhere.\nMarius still considered Cosette ugly, when she had already begun to\nthink Marius handsome. But as he paid no attention to her, the young man\nwas nothing to her.\n\nStill, she could not refrain from saying to herself that he had\nbeautiful hair, beautiful eyes, handsome teeth, a charming tone of voice\nwhen she heard him conversing with his comrades, that he held himself\nbadly when he walked, if you like, but with a grace that was all his\nown, that he did not appear to be at all stupid, that his whole person\nwas noble, gentle, simple, proud, and that, in short, though he seemed\nto be poor, yet his air was fine.\n\nOn the day when their eyes met at last, and said to each other those\nfirst, obscure, and ineffable things which the glance lisps, Cosette did\nnot immediately understand. She returned thoughtfully to the house in\nthe Rue de l'Ouest, where Jean Valjean, according to his custom, had\ncome to spend six weeks. The next morning, on waking, she thought of\nthat strange young man, so long indifferent and icy, who now seemed to\npay attention to her, and it did not appear to her that this attention\nwas the least in the world agreeable to her. She was, on the contrary,\nsomewhat incensed at this handsome and disdainful individual. A\nsubstratum of war stirred within her. It struck her, and the idea caused\nher a wholly childish joy, that she was going to take her revenge at\nlast.\n\nKnowing that she was beautiful, she was thoroughly conscious, though\nin an indistinct fashion, that she possessed a weapon. Women play with\ntheir beauty as children do with a knife. They wound themselves.\n\nThe reader will recall Marius' hesitations, his palpitations, his\nterrors. He remained on his bench and did not approach. This vexed\nCosette. One day, she said to Jean Valjean: \"Father, let us stroll about\na little in that direction.\" Seeing that Marius did not come to her,\nshe went to him. In such cases, all women resemble Mahomet. And then,\nstrange to say, the first symptom of true love in a young man is\ntimidity; in a young girl it is boldness. This is surprising, and yet\nnothing is more simple. It is the two sexes tending to approach each\nother and assuming, each the other's qualities.\n\nThat day, Cosette's glance drove Marius beside himself, and Marius'\nglance set Cosette to trembling. Marius went away confident, and Cosette\nuneasy. From that day forth, they adored each other.\n\nThe first thing that Cosette felt was a confused and profound\nmelancholy. It seemed to her that her soul had become black since the\nday before. She no longer recognized it. The whiteness of soul in young\ngirls, which is composed of coldness and gayety, resembles snow. It\nmelts in love, which is its sun.\n\nCosette did not know what love was. She had never heard the word uttered\nin its terrestrial sense. On the books of profane music which entered\nthe convent, amour (love) was replaced by tambour (drum) or pandour.\nThis created enigmas which exercised the imaginations of the big girls,\nsuch as: Ah, how delightful is the drum! or, Pity is not a pandour. But\nCosette had left the convent too early to have occupied herself much\nwith the \"drum.\" Therefore, she did not know what name to give to what\nshe now felt. Is any one the less ill because one does not know the name\nof one's malady?\n\nShe loved with all the more passion because she loved ignorantly. She\ndid not know whether it was a good thing or a bad thing, useful or\ndangerous, eternal or temporary, allowable or prohibited; she loved. She\nwould have been greatly astonished, had any one said to her: \"You do not\nsleep? But that is forbidden! You do not eat? Why, that is very bad! You\nhave oppressions and palpitations of the heart? That must not be! You\nblush and turn pale, when a certain being clad in black appears at the\nend of a certain green walk? But that is abominable!\" She would not have\nunderstood, and she would have replied: \"What fault is there of mine in\na matter in which I have no power and of which I know nothing?\"\n\nIt turned out that the love which presented itself was exactly suited to\nthe state of her soul. It was a sort of admiration at a distance, a mute\ncontemplation, the deification of a stranger. It was the apparition of\nyouth to youth, the dream of nights become a reality yet remaining\na dream, the longed-for phantom realized and made flesh at last, but\nhaving as yet, neither name, nor fault, nor spot, nor exigence, nor\ndefect; in a word, the distant lover who lingered in the ideal, a\nchimaera with a form. Any nearer and more palpable meeting would have\nalarmed Cosette at this first stage, when she was still half immersed in\nthe exaggerated mists of the cloister. She had all the fears of children\nand all the fears of nuns combined. The spirit of the convent, with\nwhich she had been permeated for the space of five years, was still in\nthe process of slow evaporation from her person, and made everything\ntremble around her. In this situation he was not a lover, he was not\neven an admirer, he was a vision. She set herself to adoring Marius as\nsomething charming, luminous, and impossible.\n\nAs extreme innocence borders on extreme coquetry, she smiled at him with\nall frankness.\n\nEvery day, she looked forward to the hour for their walk with\nimpatience, she found Marius there, she felt herself unspeakably happy,\nand thought in all sincerity that she was expressing her whole thought\nwhen she said to Jean Valjean:--\n\n\"What a delicious garden that Luxembourg is!\"\n\nMarius and Cosette were in the dark as to one another. They did not\naddress each other, they did not salute each other, they did not know\neach other; they saw each other; and like stars of heaven which are\nseparated by millions of leagues, they lived by gazing at each other.\n\nIt was thus that Cosette gradually became a woman and developed,\nbeautiful and loving, with a consciousness of her beauty, and in\nignorance of her love. She was a coquette to boot through her ignorance.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII--TO ONE SADNESS OPPOSE A SADNESS AND A HALF\n\nAll situations have their instincts. Old and eternal Mother Nature\nwarned Jean Valjean in a dim way of the presence of Marius. Jean Valjean\nshuddered to the very bottom of his soul. Jean Valjean saw nothing, knew\nnothing, and yet he scanned with obstinate attention, the darkness\nin which he walked, as though he felt on one side of him something in\nprocess of construction, and on the other, something which was crumbling\naway. Marius, also warned, and, in accordance with the deep law of God,\nby that same Mother Nature, did all he could to keep out of sight of\n\"the father.\" Nevertheless, it came to pass that Jean Valjean sometimes\nespied him. Marius' manners were no longer in the least natural. He\nexhibited ambiguous prudence and awkward daring. He no longer came quite\nclose to them as formerly. He seated himself at a distance and pretended\nto be reading; why did he pretend that? Formerly he had come in his old\ncoat, now he wore his new one every day; Jean Valjean was not sure\nthat he did not have his hair curled, his eyes were very queer, he wore\ngloves; in short, Jean Valjean cordially detested this young man.\n\nCosette allowed nothing to be divined. Without knowing just what was the\nmatter with her she was convinced that there was something in it, and\nthat it must be concealed.\n\nThere was a coincidence between the taste for the toilet which had\nrecently come to Cosette, and the habit of new clothes developed by\nthat stranger which was very repugnant to Jean Valjean. It might be\naccidental, no doubt, certainly, but it was a menacing accident.\n\nHe never opened his mouth to Cosette about this stranger. One day,\nhowever, he could not refrain from so doing, and, with that vague\ndespair which suddenly casts the lead into the depths of its despair, he\nsaid to her: \"What a very pedantic air that young man has!\"\n\nCosette, but a year before only an indifferent little girl, would have\nreplied: \"Why, no, he is charming.\" Ten years later, with the love\nof Marius in her heart, she would have answered: \"A pedant, and\ninsufferable to the sight! You are right!\"--At the moment in life\nand the heart which she had then attained, she contented herself with\nreplying, with supreme calmness: \"That young man!\"\n\nAs though she now beheld him for the first time in her life.\n\n\"How stupid I am!\" thought Jean Valjean. \"She had not noticed him. It is\nI who have pointed him out to her.\"\n\nOh, simplicity of the old! oh, the depth of children!\n\nIt is one of the laws of those fresh years of suffering and trouble, of\nthose vivacious conflicts between a first love and the first obstacles,\nthat the young girl does not allow herself to be caught in any trap\nwhatever, and that the young man falls into every one. Jean Valjean\nhad instituted an undeclared war against Marius, which Marius, with\nthe sublime stupidity of his passion and his age, did not divine. Jean\nValjean laid a host of ambushes for him; he changed his hour, he changed\nhis bench, he forgot his handkerchief, he came alone to the Luxembourg;\nMarius dashed headlong into all these snares; and to all the\ninterrogation marks planted by Jean Valjean in his pathway, he\ningenuously answered \"yes.\" But Cosette remained immured in her apparent\nunconcern and in her imperturbable tranquillity, so that Jean Valjean\narrived at the following conclusion: \"That ninny is madly in love with\nCosette, but Cosette does not even know that he exists.\"\n\nNone the less did he bear in his heart a mournful tremor. The minute\nwhen Cosette would love might strike at any moment. Does not everything\nbegin with indifference?\n\nOnly once did Cosette make a mistake and alarm him. He rose from his\nseat to depart, after a stay of three hours, and she said: \"What,\nalready?\"\n\nJean Valjean had not discontinued his trips to the Luxembourg, as he\ndid not wish to do anything out of the way, and as, above all things,\nhe feared to arouse Cosette; but during the hours which were so sweet\nto the lovers, while Cosette was sending her smile to the intoxicated\nMarius, who perceived nothing else now, and who now saw nothing in all\nthe world but an adored and radiant face, Jean Valjean was fixing on\nMarius flashing and terrible eyes. He, who had finally come to believe\nhimself incapable of a malevolent feeling, experienced moments when\nMarius was present, in which he thought he was becoming savage and\nferocious once more, and he felt the old depths of his soul, which\nhad formerly contained so much wrath, opening once more and rising up\nagainst that young man. It almost seemed to him that unknown craters\nwere forming in his bosom.\n\nWhat! he was there, that creature! What was he there for? He came\ncreeping about, smelling out, examining, trying! He came, saying: \"Hey!\nWhy not?\" He came to prowl about his, Jean Valjean's, life! to prowl\nabout his happiness, with the purpose of seizing it and bearing it away!\n\nJean Valjean added: \"Yes, that's it! What is he in search of? An\nadventure! What does he want? A love affair! A love affair! And I? What!\nI have been first, the most wretched of men, and then the most unhappy,\nand I have traversed sixty years of life on my knees, I have suffered\neverything that man can suffer, I have grown old without having been\nyoung, I have lived without a family, without relatives, without\nfriends, without life, without children, I have left my blood on every\nstone, on every bramble, on every mile-post, along every wall, I have\nbeen gentle, though others have been hard to me, and kind, although\nothers have been malicious, I have become an honest man once more, in\nspite of everything, I have repented of the evil that I have done and\nhave forgiven the evil that has been done to me, and at the moment\nwhen I receive my recompense, at the moment when it is all over, at the\nmoment when I am just touching the goal, at the moment when I have what\nI desire, it is well, it is good, I have paid, I have earned it, all\nthis is to take flight, all this will vanish, and I shall lose Cosette,\nand I shall lose my life, my joy, my soul, because it has pleased a\ngreat booby to come and lounge at the Luxembourg.\"\n\nThen his eyes were filled with a sad and extraordinary gleam.\n\nIt was no longer a man gazing at a man; it was no longer an enemy\nsurveying an enemy. It was a dog scanning a thief.\n\nThe reader knows the rest. Marius pursued his senseless course. One day\nhe followed Cosette to the Rue de l'Ouest. Another day he spoke to\nthe porter. The porter, on his side, spoke, and said to Jean Valjean:\n\"Monsieur, who is that curious young man who is asking for you?\" On the\nmorrow Jean Valjean bestowed on Marius that glance which Marius at last\nperceived. A week later, Jean Valjean had taken his departure. He swore\nto himself that he would never again set foot either in the Luxembourg\nor in the Rue de l'Ouest. He returned to the Rue Plumet.\n\nCosette did not complain, she said nothing, she asked no questions, she\ndid not seek to learn his reasons; she had already reached the point\nwhere she was afraid of being divined, and of betraying herself. Jean\nValjean had no experience of these miseries, the only miseries which\nare charming and the only ones with which he was not acquainted; the\nconsequence was that he did not understand the grave significance of\nCosette's silence.\n\nHe merely noticed that she had grown sad, and he grew gloomy. On his\nside and on hers, inexperience had joined issue.\n\nOnce he made a trial. He asked Cosette:--\n\n\"Would you like to come to the Luxembourg?\"\n\nA ray illuminated Cosette's pale face.\n\n\"Yes,\" said she.\n\nThey went thither. Three months had elapsed. Marius no longer went\nthere. Marius was not there.\n\nOn the following day, Jean Valjean asked Cosette again:--\n\n\"Would you like to come to the Luxembourg?\"\n\nShe replied, sadly and gently:--\n\n\"No.\"\n\nJean Valjean was hurt by this sadness, and heart-broken at this\ngentleness.\n\nWhat was going on in that mind which was so young and yet already so\nimpenetrable? What was on its way there within? What was taking place\nin Cosette's soul? Sometimes, instead of going to bed, Jean Valjean\nremained seated on his pallet, with his head in his hands, and he passed\nwhole nights asking himself: \"What has Cosette in her mind?\" and in\nthinking of the things that she might be thinking about.\n\nOh! at such moments, what mournful glances did he cast towards that\ncloister, that chaste peak, that abode of angels, that inaccessible\nglacier of virtue! How he contemplated, with despairing ecstasy, that\nconvent garden, full of ignored flowers and cloistered virgins, where\nall perfumes and all souls mount straight to heaven! How he adored that\nEden forever closed against him, whence he had voluntarily and madly\nemerged! How he regretted his abnegation and his folly in having brought\nCosette back into the world, poor hero of sacrifice, seized and hurled\nto the earth by his very self-devotion! How he said to himself, \"What\nhave I done?\"\n\nHowever, nothing of all this was perceptible to Cosette. No ill-temper,\nno harshness. His face was always serene and kind. Jean Valjean's\nmanners were more tender and more paternal than ever. If anything could\nhave betrayed his lack of joy, it was his increased suavity.\n\nOn her side, Cosette languished. She suffered from the absence of Marius\nas she had rejoiced in his presence, peculiarly, without exactly being\nconscious of it. When Jean Valjean ceased to take her on their customary\nstrolls, a feminine instinct murmured confusedly, at the bottom of her\nheart, that she must not seem to set store on the Luxembourg garden, and\nthat if this proved to be a matter of indifference to her, her father\nwould take her thither once more. But days, weeks, months, elapsed. Jean\nValjean had tacitly accepted Cosette's tacit consent. She regretted it.\nIt was too late. So Marius had disappeared; all was over. The day on\nwhich she returned to the Luxembourg, Marius was no longer there. What\nwas to be done? Should she ever find him again? She felt an anguish at\nher heart, which nothing relieved, and which augmented every day; she no\nlonger knew whether it was winter or summer, whether it was raining or\nshining, whether the birds were singing, whether it was the season for\ndahlias or daisies, whether the Luxembourg was more charming than\nthe Tuileries, whether the linen which the laundress brought home\nwas starched too much or not enough, whether Toussaint had done \"her\nmarketing\" well or ill; and she remained dejected, absorbed, attentive\nto but a single thought, her eyes vague and staring as when one gazes by\nnight at a black and fathomless spot where an apparition has vanished.\n\nHowever, she did not allow Jean Valjean to perceive anything of this,\nexcept her pallor.\n\nShe still wore her sweet face for him.\n\nThis pallor sufficed but too thoroughly to trouble Jean Valjean.\nSometimes he asked her:--\n\n\"What is the matter with you?\"\n\nShe replied: \"There is nothing the matter with me.\"\n\nAnd after a silence, when she divined that he was sad also, she would\nadd:--\n\n\"And you, father--is there anything wrong with you?\"\n\n\"With me? Nothing,\" said he.\n\nThese two beings who had loved each other so exclusively, and with so\ntouching an affection, and who had lived so long for each other\nnow suffered side by side, each on the other's account; without\nacknowledging it to each other, without anger towards each other, and\nwith a smile.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII--THE CHAIN-GANG\n\nJean Valjean was the more unhappy of the two. Youth, even in its\nsorrows, always possesses its own peculiar radiance.\n\nAt times, Jean Valjean suffered so greatly that he became puerile. It is\nthe property of grief to cause the childish side of man to reappear. He\nhad an unconquerable conviction that Cosette was escaping from him. He\nwould have liked to resist, to retain her, to arouse her enthusiasm by\nsome external and brilliant matter. These ideas, puerile, as we have\njust said, and at the same time senile, conveyed to him, by their very\nchildishness, a tolerably just notion of the influence of gold lace on\nthe imaginations of young girls. He once chanced to see a general on\nhorseback, in full uniform, pass along the street, Comte Coutard, the\ncommandant of Paris. He envied that gilded man; what happiness it\nwould be, he said to himself, if he could put on that suit which was an\nincontestable thing; and if Cosette could behold him thus, she would be\ndazzled, and when he had Cosette on his arm and passed the gates of the\nTuileries, the guard would present arms to him, and that would suffice\nfor Cosette, and would dispel her idea of looking at young men.\n\nAn unforeseen shock was added to these sad reflections.\n\nIn the isolated life which they led, and since they had come to dwell\nin the Rue Plumet, they had contracted one habit. They sometimes took\na pleasure trip to see the sun rise, a mild species of enjoyment which\nbefits those who are entering life and those who are quitting it.\n\nFor those who love solitude, a walk in the early morning is equivalent\nto a stroll by night, with the cheerfulness of nature added. The streets\nare deserted and the birds are singing. Cosette, a bird herself, liked\nto rise early. These matutinal excursions were planned on the preceding\nevening. He proposed, and she agreed. It was arranged like a plot, they\nset out before daybreak, and these trips were so many small delights for\nCosette. These innocent eccentricities please young people.\n\nJean Valjean's inclination led him, as we have seen, to the least\nfrequented spots, to solitary nooks, to forgotten places. There then\nexisted, in the vicinity of the barriers of Paris, a sort of poor\nmeadows, which were almost confounded with the city, where grew in\nsummer sickly grain, and which, in autumn, after the harvest had been\ngathered, presented the appearance, not of having been reaped, but\npeeled. Jean Valjean loved to haunt these fields. Cosette was not bored\nthere. It meant solitude to him and liberty to her. There, she became a\nlittle girl once more, she could run and almost play; she took off her\nhat, laid it on Jean Valjean's knees, and gathered bunches of flowers.\nShe gazed at the butterflies on the flowers, but did not catch them;\ngentleness and tenderness are born with love, and the young girl who\ncherishes within her breast a trembling and fragile ideal has mercy on\nthe wing of a butterfly. She wove garlands of poppies, which she placed\non her head, and which, crossed and penetrated with sunlight, glowing\nuntil they flamed, formed for her rosy face a crown of burning embers.\n\nEven after their life had grown sad, they kept up their custom of early\nstrolls.\n\nOne morning in October, therefore, tempted by the serene perfection of\nthe autumn of 1831, they set out, and found themselves at break of\nday near the Barriere du Maine. It was not dawn, it was daybreak; a\ndelightful and stern moment. A few constellations here and there in the\ndeep, pale azure, the earth all black, the heavens all white, a quiver\namid the blades of grass, everywhere the mysterious chill of twilight. A\nlark, which seemed mingled with the stars, was carolling at a prodigious\nheight, and one would have declared that that hymn of pettiness calmed\nimmensity. In the East, the Valde-Grace projected its dark mass on the\nclear horizon with the sharpness of steel; Venus dazzlingly brilliant\nwas rising behind that dome and had the air of a soul making its escape\nfrom a gloomy edifice.\n\nAll was peace and silence; there was no one on the road; a few stray\nlaborers, of whom they caught barely a glimpse, were on their way to\ntheir work along the side-paths.\n\nJean Valjean was sitting in a cross-walk on some planks deposited at the\ngate of a timber-yard. His face was turned towards the highway, his back\ntowards the light; he had forgotten the sun which was on the point of\nrising; he had sunk into one of those profound absorptions in which the\nmind becomes concentrated, which imprison even the eye, and which are\nequivalent to four walls. There are meditations which may be called\nvertical; when one is at the bottom of them, time is required to return\nto earth. Jean Valjean had plunged into one of these reveries. He was\nthinking of Cosette, of the happiness that was possible if nothing came\nbetween him and her, of the light with which she filled his life, a\nlight which was but the emanation of her soul. He was almost happy in\nhis revery. Cosette, who was standing beside him, was gazing at the\nclouds as they turned rosy.\n\nAll at once Cosette exclaimed: \"Father, I should think some one was\ncoming yonder.\" Jean Valjean raised his eyes.\n\nCosette was right. The causeway which leads to the ancient Barriere du\nMaine is a prolongation, as the reader knows, of the Rue de Sevres,\nand is cut at right angles by the inner boulevard. At the elbow of the\ncauseway and the boulevard, at the spot where it branches, they heard a\nnoise which it was difficult to account for at that hour, and a sort of\nconfused pile made its appearance. Some shapeless thing which was coming\nfrom the boulevard was turning into the road.\n\nIt grew larger, it seemed to move in an orderly manner, though it was\nbristling and quivering; it seemed to be a vehicle, but its load could\nnot be distinctly made out. There were horses, wheels, shouts; whips\nwere cracking. By degrees the outlines became fixed, although bathed\nin shadows. It was a vehicle, in fact, which had just turned from the\nboulevard into the highway, and which was directing its course towards\nthe barrier near which sat Jean Valjean; a second, of the same aspect,\nfollowed, then a third, then a fourth; seven chariots made their\nappearance in succession, the heads of the horses touching the rear of\nthe wagon in front. Figures were moving on these vehicles, flashes were\nvisible through the dusk as though there were naked swords there, a\nclanking became audible which resembled the rattling of chains, and as\nthis something advanced, the sound of voices waxed louder, and it turned\ninto a terrible thing such as emerges from the cave of dreams.\n\nAs it drew nearer, it assumed a form, and was outlined behind the trees\nwith the pallid hue of an apparition; the mass grew white; the day,\nwhich was slowly dawning, cast a wan light on this swarming heap which\nwas at once both sepulchral and living, the heads of the figures turned\ninto the faces of corpses, and this is what it proved to be:--\n\nSeven wagons were driving in a file along the road. The first six were\nsingularly constructed. They resembled coopers' drays; they consisted\nof long ladders placed on two wheels and forming barrows at their rear\nextremities. Each dray, or rather let us say, each ladder, was attached\nto four horses harnessed tandem. On these ladders strange clusters of\nmen were being drawn. In the faint light, these men were to be divined\nrather than seen. Twenty-four on each vehicle, twelve on a side, back to\nback, facing the passers-by, their legs dangling in the air,--this was\nthe manner in which these men were travelling, and behind their backs\nthey had something which clanked, and which was a chain, and on their\nnecks something which shone, and which was an iron collar. Each man had\nhis collar, but the chain was for all; so that if these four and twenty\nmen had occasion to alight from the dray and walk, they were seized with\na sort of inexorable unity, and were obliged to wind over the ground\nwith the chain for a backbone, somewhat after the fashion of millepeds.\nIn the back and front of each vehicle, two men armed with muskets\nstood erect, each holding one end of the chain under his foot. The iron\nnecklets were square. The seventh vehicle, a huge rack-sided baggage\nwagon, without a hood, had four wheels and six horses, and carried a\nsonorous pile of iron boilers, cast-iron pots, braziers, and chains,\namong which were mingled several men who were pinioned and stretched at\nfull length, and who seemed to be ill. This wagon, all lattice-work,\nwas garnished with dilapidated hurdles which appeared to have served for\nformer punishments. These vehicles kept to the middle of the road. On\neach side marched a double hedge of guards of infamous aspect, wearing\nthree-cornered hats, like the soldiers under the Directory, shabby,\ncovered with spots and holes, muffled in uniforms of veterans and the\ntrousers of undertakers' men, half gray, half blue, which were almost\nhanging in rags, with red epaulets, yellow shoulder belts, short sabres,\nmuskets, and cudgels; they were a species of soldier-blackguards.\nThese myrmidons seemed composed of the abjectness of the beggar and the\nauthority of the executioner. The one who appeared to be their chief\nheld a postilion's whip in his hand. All these details, blurred by the\ndimness of dawn, became more and more clearly outlined as the light\nincreased. At the head and in the rear of the convoy rode mounted\ngendarmes, serious and with sword in fist.\n\nThis procession was so long that when the first vehicle reached the\nbarrier, the last was barely debauching from the boulevard. A throng,\nsprung, it is impossible to say whence, and formed in a twinkling, as\nis frequently the case in Paris, pressed forward from both sides of\nthe road and looked on. In the neighboring lanes the shouts of people\ncalling to each other and the wooden shoes of market-gardeners hastening\nup to gaze were audible.\n\nThe men massed upon the drays allowed themselves to be jolted along in\nsilence. They were livid with the chill of morning. They all wore linen\ntrousers, and their bare feet were thrust into wooden shoes. The rest\nof their costume was a fantasy of wretchedness. Their accoutrements were\nhorribly incongruous; nothing is more funereal than the harlequin in\nrags. Battered felt hats, tarpaulin caps, hideous woollen nightcaps,\nand, side by side with a short blouse, a black coat broken at the elbow;\nmany wore women's headgear, others had baskets on their heads; hairy\nbreasts were visible, and through the rent in their garments tattooed\ndesigns could be descried; temples of Love, flaming hearts, Cupids;\neruptions and unhealthy red blotches could also be seen. Two or three\nhad a straw rope attached to the cross-bar of the dray, and suspended\nunder them like a stirrup, which supported their feet. One of them held\nin his hand and raised to his mouth something which had the appearance\nof a black stone and which he seemed to be gnawing; it was bread which\nhe was eating. There were no eyes there which were not either dry,\ndulled, or flaming with an evil light. The escort troop cursed, the men\nin chains did not utter a syllable; from time to time the sound of\na blow became audible as the cudgels descended on shoulder-blades or\nskulls; some of these men were yawning; their rags were terrible;\ntheir feet hung down, their shoulders oscillated, their heads clashed\ntogether, their fetters clanked, their eyes glared ferociously, their\nfists clenched or fell open inertly like the hands of corpses; in the\nrear of the convoy ran a band of children screaming with laughter.\n\nThis file of vehicles, whatever its nature was, was mournful. It\nwas evident that to-morrow, that an hour hence, a pouring rain might\ndescend, that it might be followed by another and another, and that\ntheir dilapidated garments would be drenched, that once soaked, these\nmen would not get dry again, that once chilled, they would not again\nget warm, that their linen trousers would be glued to their bones by the\ndownpour, that the water would fill their shoes, that no lashes from\nthe whips would be able to prevent their jaws from chattering, that the\nchain would continue to bind them by the neck, that their legs would\ncontinue to dangle, and it was impossible not to shudder at the sight\nof these human beings thus bound and passive beneath the cold clouds of\nautumn, and delivered over to the rain, to the blast, to all the furies\nof the air, like trees and stones.\n\nBlows from the cudgel were not omitted even in the case of the sick men,\nwho lay there knotted with ropes and motionless on the seventh wagon,\nand who appeared to have been tossed there like sacks filled with\nmisery.\n\nSuddenly, the sun made its appearance; the immense light of the Orient\nburst forth, and one would have said that it had set fire to all those\nferocious heads. Their tongues were unloosed; a conflagration of grins,\noaths, and songs exploded. The broad horizontal sheet of light severed\nthe file in two parts, illuminating heads and bodies, leaving feet and\nwheels in the obscurity. Thoughts made their appearance on these faces;\nit was a terrible moment; visible demons with their masks removed,\nfierce souls laid bare. Though lighted up, this wild throng remained in\ngloom. Some, who were gay, had in their mouths quills through which they\nblew vermin over the crowd, picking out the women; the dawn accentuated\nthese lamentable profiles with the blackness of its shadows; there\nwas not one of these creatures who was not deformed by reason of\nwretchedness; and the whole was so monstrous that one would have\nsaid that the sun's brilliancy had been changed into the glare of the\nlightning. The wagon-load which headed the line had struck up a song,\nand were shouting at the top of their voices with a haggard joviality,\na potpourri by Desaugiers, then famous, called The Vestal; the trees\nshivered mournfully; in the cross-lanes, countenances of bourgeois\nlistened in an idiotic delight to these coarse strains droned by\nspectres.\n\nAll sorts of distress met in this procession as in chaos; here were to\nbe found the facial angles of every sort of beast, old men, youths,\nbald heads, gray beards, cynical monstrosities, sour resignation, savage\ngrins, senseless attitudes, snouts surmounted by caps, heads like those\nof young girls with corkscrew curls on the temples, infantile visages,\nand by reason of that, horrible thin skeleton faces, to which death\nalone was lacking. On the first cart was a negro, who had been a slave,\nin all probability, and who could make a comparison of his chains. The\nfrightful leveller from below, shame, had passed over these brows; at\nthat degree of abasement, the last transformations were suffered by all\nin their extremest depths, and ignorance, converted into dulness, was\nthe equal of intelligence converted into despair. There was no choice\npossible between these men who appeared to the eye as the flower of the\nmud. It was evident that the person who had had the ordering of that\nunclean procession had not classified them. These beings had been\nfettered and coupled pell-mell, in alphabetical disorder, probably, and\nloaded hap-hazard on those carts. Nevertheless, horrors, when grouped\ntogether, always end by evolving a result; all additions of wretched men\ngive a sum total, each chain exhaled a common soul, and each dray-load\nhad its own physiognomy. By the side of the one where they were singing,\nthere was one where they were howling; a third where they were begging;\none could be seen in which they were gnashing their teeth; another load\nmenaced the spectators, another blasphemed God; the last was as silent\nas the tomb. Dante would have thought that he beheld his seven circles\nof hell on the march. The march of the damned to their tortures,\nperformed in sinister wise, not on the formidable and flaming chariot\nof the Apocalypse, but, what was more mournful than that, on the gibbet\ncart.\n\nOne of the guards, who had a hook on the end of his cudgel, made a\npretence from time to time, of stirring up this mass of human filth.\nAn old woman in the crowd pointed them out to her little boy five years\nold, and said to him: \"Rascal, let that be a warning to you!\"\n\nAs the songs and blasphemies increased, the man who appeared to be the\ncaptain of the escort cracked his whip, and at that signal a fearful\ndull and blind flogging, which produced the sound of hail, fell upon the\nseven dray-loads; many roared and foamed at the mouth; which redoubled\nthe delight of the street urchins who had hastened up, a swarm of flies\non these wounds.\n\nJean Valjean's eyes had assumed a frightful expression. They were no\nlonger eyes; they were those deep and glassy objects which replace the\nglance in the case of certain wretched men, which seem unconscious\nof reality, and in which flames the reflection of terrors and of\ncatastrophes. He was not looking at a spectacle, he was seeing a vision.\nHe tried to rise, to flee, to make his escape; he could not move his\nfeet. Sometimes, the things that you see seize upon you and hold you\nfast. He remained nailed to the spot, petrified, stupid, asking himself,\nathwart confused and inexpressible anguish, what this sepulchral\npersecution signified, and whence had come that pandemonium which was\npursuing him. All at once, he raised his hand to his brow, a gesture\nhabitual to those whose memory suddenly returns; he remembered that this\nwas, in fact, the usual itinerary, that it was customary to make this\ndetour in order to avoid all possibility of encountering royalty on the\nroad to Fontainebleau, and that, five and thirty years before, he had\nhimself passed through that barrier.\n\nCosette was no less terrified, but in a different way. She did not\nunderstand; what she beheld did not seem to her to be possible; at\nlength she cried:--\n\n\"Father! What are those men in those carts?\"\n\nJean Valjean replied: \"Convicts.\"\n\n\"Whither are they going?\"\n\n\"To the galleys.\"\n\nAt that moment, the cudgelling, multiplied by a hundred hands, became\nzealous, blows with the flat of the sword were mingled with it, it was a\nperfect storm of whips and clubs; the convicts bent before it, a hideous\nobedience was evoked by the torture, and all held their peace, darting\nglances like chained wolves.\n\nCosette trembled in every limb; she resumed:--\n\n\"Father, are they still men?\"\n\n\"Sometimes,\" answered the unhappy man.\n\nIt was the chain-gang, in fact, which had set out before daybreak from\nBicetre, and had taken the road to Mans in order to avoid Fontainebleau,\nwhere the King then was. This caused the horrible journey to last three\nor four days longer; but torture may surely be prolonged with the object\nof sparing the royal personage a sight of it.\n\nJean Valjean returned home utterly overwhelmed. Such encounters are\nshocks, and the memory that they leave behind them resembles a thorough\nshaking up.\n\nNevertheless, Jean Valjean did not observe that, on his way back to\nthe Rue de Babylone with Cosette, the latter was plying him with other\nquestions on the subject of what they had just seen; perhaps he was\ntoo much absorbed in his own dejection to notice her words and reply to\nthem. But when Cosette was leaving him in the evening, to betake herself\nto bed, he heard her say in a low voice, and as though talking to\nherself: \"It seems to me, that if I were to find one of those men in my\npathway, oh, my God, I should die merely from the sight of him close at\nhand.\"\n\nFortunately, chance ordained that on the morrow of that tragic day,\nthere was some official solemnity apropos of I know not what,--fetes in\nParis, a review in the Champ de Mars, jousts on the Seine, theatrical\nperformances in the Champs-Elysees, fireworks at the Arc de l'Etoile,\nilluminations everywhere. Jean Valjean did violence to his habits, and\ntook Cosette to see these rejoicings, for the purpose of diverting her\nfrom the memory of the day before, and of effacing, beneath the smiling\ntumult of all Paris, the abominable thing which had passed before her.\nThe review with which the festival was spiced made the presence of\nuniforms perfectly natural; Jean Valjean donned his uniform of a\nnational guard with the vague inward feeling of a man who is betaking\nhimself to shelter. However, this trip seemed to attain its object.\nCosette, who made it her law to please her father, and to whom,\nmoreover, all spectacles were a novelty, accepted this diversion\nwith the light and easy good grace of youth, and did not pout too\ndisdainfully at that flutter of enjoyment called a public fete; so that\nJean Valjean was able to believe that he had succeeded, and that no\ntrace of that hideous vision remained.\n\nSome days later, one morning, when the sun was shining brightly, and\nthey were both on the steps leading to the garden, another infraction of\nthe rules which Jean Valjean seemed to have imposed upon himself, and\nto the custom of remaining in her chamber which melancholy had caused\nCosette to adopt, Cosette, in a wrapper, was standing erect in that\nnegligent attire of early morning which envelops young girls in an\nadorable way and which produces the effect of a cloud drawn over a star;\nand, with her head bathed in light, rosy after a good sleep, submitting\nto the gentle glances of the tender old man, she was picking a daisy\nto pieces. Cosette did not know the delightful legend, I love a little,\npassionately, etc.--who was there who could have taught her? She was\nhandling the flower instinctively, innocently, without a suspicion that\nto pluck a daisy apart is to do the same by a heart. If there were a\nfourth, and smiling Grace called Melancholy, she would have worn the air\nof that Grace. Jean Valjean was fascinated by the contemplation of those\ntiny fingers on that flower, and forgetful of everything in the radiance\nemitted by that child. A red-breast was warbling in the thicket, on one\nside. White cloudlets floated across the sky, so gayly, that one would\nhave said that they had just been set at liberty. Cosette went on\nattentively tearing the leaves from her flower; she seemed to be\nthinking about something; but whatever it was, it must be something\ncharming; all at once she turned her head over her shoulder with the\ndelicate languor of a swan, and said to Jean Valjean: \"Father, what are\nthe galleys like?\"\n\n\n\n\nBOOK FOURTH.--SUCCOR FROM BELOW MAY TURN OUT TO BE SUCCOR FROM ON HIGH\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I--A WOUND WITHOUT, HEALING WITHIN\n\nThus their life clouded over by degrees.\n\nBut one diversion, which had formerly been a happiness, remained to\nthem, which was to carry bread to those who were hungry, and clothing\nto those who were cold. Cosette often accompanied Jean Valjean on these\nvisits to the poor, on which they recovered some remnants of their\nformer free intercourse; and sometimes, when the day had been a good\none, and they had assisted many in distress, and cheered and warmed many\nlittle children, Cosette was rather merry in the evening. It was at this\nepoch that they paid their visit to the Jondrette den.\n\nOn the day following that visit, Jean Valjean made his appearance in the\npavilion in the morning, calm as was his wont, but with a large wound on\nhis left arm which was much inflamed, and very angry, which resembled a\nburn, and which he explained in some way or other. This wound resulted\nin his being detained in the house for a month with fever. He would not\ncall in a doctor. When Cosette urged him, \"Call the dog-doctor,\" said\nhe.\n\nCosette dressed the wound morning and evening with so divine an air and\nsuch angelic happiness at being of use to him, that Jean Valjean felt\nall his former joy returning, his fears and anxieties dissipating, and\nhe gazed at Cosette, saying: \"Oh! what a kindly wound! Oh! what a good\nmisfortune!\"\n\nCosette on perceiving that her father was ill, had deserted the pavilion\nand again taken a fancy to the little lodging and the back courtyard.\nShe passed nearly all her days beside Jean Valjean and read to him\nthe books which he desired. Generally they were books of travel. Jean\nValjean was undergoing a new birth; his happiness was reviving in these\nineffable rays; the Luxembourg, the prowling young stranger, Cosette's\ncoldness,--all these clouds upon his soul were growing dim. He had\nreached the point where he said to himself: \"I imagined all that. I am\nan old fool.\"\n\nHis happiness was so great that the horrible discovery of the\nThenardiers made in the Jondrette hovel, unexpected as it was, had,\nafter a fashion, glided over him unnoticed. He had succeeded in making\nhis escape; all trace of him was lost--what more did he care for! he\nonly thought of those wretched beings to pity them. \"Here they are in\nprison, and henceforth they will be incapacitated for doing any harm,\"\nhe thought, \"but what a lamentable family in distress!\"\n\nAs for the hideous vision of the Barriere du Maine, Cosette had not\nreferred to it again.\n\nSister Sainte-Mechtilde had taught Cosette music in the convent; Cosette\nhad the voice of a linnet with a soul, and sometimes, in the evening,\nin the wounded man's humble abode, she warbled melancholy songs which\ndelighted Jean Valjean.\n\nSpring came; the garden was so delightful at that season of the year,\nthat Jean Valjean said to Cosette:--\n\n\"You never go there; I want you to stroll in it.\"\n\n\"As you like, father,\" said Cosette.\n\nAnd for the sake of obeying her father, she resumed her walks in the\ngarden, generally alone, for, as we have mentioned, Jean Valjean, who\nwas probably afraid of being seen through the fence, hardly ever went\nthere.\n\nJean Valjean's wound had created a diversion.\n\nWhen Cosette saw that her father was suffering less, that he was\nconvalescing, and that he appeared to be happy, she experienced a\ncontentment which she did not even perceive, so gently and naturally\nhad it come. Then, it was in the month of March, the days were growing\nlonger, the winter was departing, the winter always bears away with it a\nportion of our sadness; then came April, that daybreak of summer, fresh\nas dawn always is, gay like every childhood; a little inclined to weep\nat times like the new-born being that it is. In that month, nature\nhas charming gleams which pass from the sky, from the trees, from the\nmeadows and the flowers into the heart of man.\n\nCosette was still too young to escape the penetrating influence of that\nApril joy which bore so strong a resemblance to herself. Insensibly, and\nwithout her suspecting the fact, the blackness departed from her spirit.\nIn spring, sad souls grow light, as light falls into cellars at midday.\nCosette was no longer sad. However, though this was so, she did not\naccount for it to herself. In the morning, about ten o'clock, after\nbreakfast, when she had succeeded in enticing her father into the garden\nfor a quarter of an hour, and when she was pacing up and down in the\nsunlight in front of the steps, supporting his left arm for him, she did\nnot perceive that she laughed every moment and that she was happy.\n\nJean Valjean, intoxicated, beheld her growing fresh and rosy once more.\n\n\"Oh! What a good wound!\" he repeated in a whisper.\n\nAnd he felt grateful to the Thenardiers.\n\nHis wound once healed, he resumed his solitary twilight strolls.\n\nIt is a mistake to suppose that a person can stroll alone in that\nfashion in the uninhabited regions of Paris without meeting with some\nadventure.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II--MOTHER PLUTARQUE FINDS NO DIFFICULTY IN EXPLAINING A\nPHENOMENON\n\nOne evening, little Gavroche had had nothing to eat; he remembered\nthat he had not dined on the preceding day either; this was becoming\ntiresome. He resolved to make an effort to secure some supper. He\nstrolled out beyond the Salpetriere into deserted regions; that is\nwhere windfalls are to be found; where there is no one, one always\nfinds something. He reached a settlement which appeared to him to be the\nvillage of Austerlitz.\n\nIn one of his preceding lounges he had noticed there an old garden\nhaunted by an old man and an old woman, and in that garden, a passable\napple-tree. Beside the apple-tree stood a sort of fruit-house, which was\nnot securely fastened, and where one might contrive to get an apple. One\napple is a supper; one apple is life. That which was Adam's ruin might\nprove Gavroche's salvation. The garden abutted on a solitary, unpaved\nlane, bordered with brushwood while awaiting the arrival of houses; the\ngarden was separated from it by a hedge.\n\nGavroche directed his steps towards this garden; he found the lane, he\nrecognized the apple-tree, he verified the fruit-house, he examined the\nhedge; a hedge means merely one stride. The day was declining, there was\nnot even a cat in the lane, the hour was propitious. Gavroche began\nthe operation of scaling the hedge, then suddenly paused. Some one was\ntalking in the garden. Gavroche peeped through one of the breaks in the\nhedge.\n\n[Illustration: Succor from Below 4b4-1-succor-from-below]\n\nA couple of paces distant, at the foot of the hedge on the other side,\nexactly at the point where the gap which he was meditating would have\nbeen made, there was a sort of recumbent stone which formed a bench, and\non this bench was seated the old man of the garden, while the old woman\nwas standing in front of him. The old woman was grumbling. Gavroche, who\nwas not very discreet, listened.\n\n\"Monsieur Mabeuf!\" said the old woman.\n\n\"Mabeuf!\" thought Gavroche, \"that name is a perfect farce.\"\n\nThe old man who was thus addressed, did not stir. The old woman\nrepeated:--\n\n\"Monsieur Mabeuf!\"\n\nThe old man, without raising his eyes from the ground, made up his mind\nto answer:--\n\n\"What is it, Mother Plutarque?\"\n\n\"Mother Plutarque!\" thought Gavroche, \"another farcical name.\"\n\nMother Plutarque began again, and the old man was forced to accept the\nconversation:--\n\n\"The landlord is not pleased.\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"We owe three quarters rent.\"\n\n\"In three months, we shall owe him for four quarters.\"\n\n\"He says that he will turn you out to sleep.\"\n\n\"I will go.\"\n\n\"The green-grocer insists on being paid. She will no longer leave her\nfagots. What will you warm yourself with this winter? We shall have no\nwood.\"\n\n\"There is the sun.\"\n\n\"The butcher refuses to give credit; he will not let us have any more\nmeat.\"\n\n\"That is quite right. I do not digest meat well. It is too heavy.\"\n\n\"What shall we have for dinner?\"\n\n\"Bread.\"\n\n\"The baker demands a settlement, and says, 'no money, no bread.'\"\n\n\"That is well.\"\n\n\"What will you eat?\"\n\n\"We have apples in the apple-room.\"\n\n\"But, Monsieur, we can't live like that without money.\"\n\n\"I have none.\"\n\nThe old woman went away, the old man remained alone. He fell into\nthought. Gavroche became thoughtful also. It was almost dark.\n\nThe first result of Gavroche's meditation was, that instead of scaling\nthe hedge, he crouched down under it. The branches stood apart a little\nat the foot of the thicket.\n\n\"Come,\" exclaimed Gavroche mentally, \"here's a nook!\" and he curled up\nin it. His back was almost in contact with Father Mabeuf's bench. He\ncould hear the octogenarian breathe.\n\nThen, by way of dinner, he tried to sleep.\n\nIt was a cat-nap, with one eye open. While he dozed, Gavroche kept on\nthe watch.\n\nThe twilight pallor of the sky blanched the earth, and the lane formed a\nlivid line between two rows of dark bushes.\n\nAll at once, in this whitish band, two figures made their appearance.\nOne was in front, the other some distance in the rear.\n\n\"There come two creatures,\" muttered Gavroche.\n\nThe first form seemed to be some elderly bourgeois, who was bent and\nthoughtful, dressed more than plainly, and who was walking slowly\nbecause of his age, and strolling about in the open evening air.\n\nThe second was straight, firm, slender. It regulated its pace by that\nof the first; but in the voluntary slowness of its gait, suppleness\nand agility were discernible. This figure had also something fierce and\ndisquieting about it, the whole shape was that of what was then called\nan elegant; the hat was of good shape, the coat black, well cut,\nprobably of fine cloth, and well fitted in at the waist. The head was\nheld erect with a sort of robust grace, and beneath the hat the pale\nprofile of a young man could be made out in the dim light. The profile\nhad a rose in its mouth. This second form was well known to Gavroche; it\nwas Montparnasse.\n\nHe could have told nothing about the other, except that he was a\nrespectable old man.\n\nGavroche immediately began to take observations.\n\nOne of these two pedestrians evidently had a project connected with\nthe other. Gavroche was well placed to watch the course of events. The\nbedroom had turned into a hiding-place at a very opportune moment.\n\nMontparnasse on the hunt at such an hour, in such a place, betokened\nsomething threatening. Gavroche felt his gamin's heart moved with\ncompassion for the old man.\n\nWhat was he to do? Interfere? One weakness coming to the aid of another!\nIt would be merely a laughing matter for Montparnasse. Gavroche did not\nshut his eyes to the fact that the old man, in the first place, and the\nchild in the second, would make but two mouthfuls for that redoubtable\nruffian eighteen years of age.\n\nWhile Gavroche was deliberating, the attack took place, abruptly and\nhideously. The attack of the tiger on the wild ass, the attack of the\nspider on the fly. Montparnasse suddenly tossed away his rose, bounded\nupon the old man, seized him by the collar, grasped and clung to him,\nand Gavroche with difficulty restrained a scream. A moment later one of\nthese men was underneath the other, groaning, struggling, with a knee\nof marble upon his breast. Only, it was not just what Gavroche had\nexpected. The one who lay on the earth was Montparnasse; the one who\nwas on top was the old man. All this took place a few paces distant from\nGavroche.\n\nThe old man had received the shock, had returned it, and that in such\na terrible fashion, that in a twinkling, the assailant and the assailed\nhad exchanged roles.\n\n\"Here's a hearty veteran!\" thought Gavroche.\n\nHe could not refrain from clapping his hands. But it was applause\nwasted. It did not reach the combatants, absorbed and deafened as they\nwere, each by the other, as their breath mingled in the struggle.\n\nSilence ensued. Montparnasse ceased his struggles. Gavroche indulged in\nthis aside: \"Can he be dead!\"\n\nThe goodman had not uttered a word, nor given vent to a cry. He rose to\nhis feet, and Gavroche heard him say to Montparnasse:--\n\n\"Get up.\"\n\nMontparnasse rose, but the goodman held him fast. Montparnasse's\nattitude was the humiliated and furious attitude of the wolf who has\nbeen caught by a sheep.\n\nGavroche looked on and listened, making an effort to reinforce his eyes\nwith his ears. He was enjoying himself immensely.\n\nHe was repaid for his conscientious anxiety in the character of a\nspectator. He was able to catch on the wing a dialogue which borrowed\nfrom the darkness an indescribably tragic accent. The goodman\nquestioned, Montparnasse replied.\n\n\"How old are you?\"\n\n\"Nineteen.\"\n\n\"You are strong and healthy. Why do you not work?\"\n\n\"It bores me.\"\n\n\"What is your trade?\"\n\n\"An idler.\"\n\n\"Speak seriously. Can anything be done for you? What would you like to\nbe?\"\n\n\"A thief.\"\n\nA pause ensued. The old man seemed absorbed in profound thought. He\nstood motionless, and did not relax his hold on Montparnasse.\n\nEvery moment the vigorous and agile young ruffian indulged in the\ntwitchings of a wild beast caught in a snare. He gave a jerk, tried a\ncrook of the knee, twisted his limbs desperately, and made efforts to\nescape.\n\nThe old man did not appear to notice it, and held both his arms with one\nhand, with the sovereign indifference of absolute force.\n\nThe old man's revery lasted for some time, then, looking steadily at\nMontparnasse, he addressed to him in a gentle voice, in the midst of the\ndarkness where they stood, a solemn harangue, of which Gavroche did not\nlose a single syllable:--\n\n\"My child, you are entering, through indolence, on one of the most\nlaborious of lives. Ah! You declare yourself to be an idler! prepare to\ntoil. There is a certain formidable machine, have you seen it? It is\nthe rolling-mill. You must be on your guard against it, it is crafty\nand ferocious; if it catches hold of the skirt of your coat, you will be\ndrawn in bodily. That machine is laziness. Stop while there is yet time,\nand save yourself! Otherwise, it is all over with you; in a short time\nyou will be among the gearing. Once entangled, hope for nothing more.\nToil, lazybones! there is no more repose for you! The iron hand of\nimplacable toil has seized you. You do not wish to earn your living, to\nhave a task, to fulfil a duty! It bores you to be like other men? Well!\nYou will be different. Labor is the law; he who rejects it will find\nennui his torment. You do not wish to be a workingman, you will be a\nslave. Toil lets go of you on one side only to grasp you again on the\nother. You do not desire to be its friend, you shall be its negro slave.\nAh! You would have none of the honest weariness of men, you shall have\nthe sweat of the damned. Where others sing, you will rattle in your\nthroat. You will see afar off, from below, other men at work; it will\nseem to you that they are resting. The laborer, the harvester, the\nsailor, the blacksmith, will appear to you in glory like the blessed\nspirits in paradise. What radiance surrounds the forge! To guide the\nplough, to bind the sheaves, is joy. The bark at liberty in the wind,\nwhat delight! Do you, lazy idler, delve, drag on, roll, march! Drag your\nhalter. You are a beast of burden in the team of hell! Ah! To do nothing\nis your object. Well, not a week, not a day, not an hour shall you have\nfree from oppression. You will be able to lift nothing without anguish.\nEvery minute that passes will make your muscles crack. What is a feather\nto others will be a rock to you. The simplest things will become steep\nacclivities. Life will become monstrous all about you. To go, to come,\nto breathe, will be just so many terrible labors. Your lungs will\nproduce on you the effect of weighing a hundred pounds. Whether you\nshall walk here rather than there, will become a problem that must be\nsolved. Any one who wants to go out simply gives his door a push, and\nthere he is in the open air. If you wish to go out, you will be obliged\nto pierce your wall. What does every one who wants to step into the\nstreet do? He goes down stairs; you will tear up your sheets, little\nby little you will make of them a rope, then you will climb out of your\nwindow, and you will suspend yourself by that thread over an abyss, and\nit will be night, amid storm, rain, and the hurricane, and if the rope\nis too short, but one way of descending will remain to you, to fall. To\ndrop hap-hazard into the gulf, from an unknown height, on what? On what\nis beneath, on the unknown. Or you will crawl up a chimney-flue, at the\nrisk of burning; or you will creep through a sewer-pipe, at the risk of\ndrowning; I do not speak of the holes that you will be obliged to mask,\nof the stones which you will have to take up and replace twenty times a\nday, of the plaster that you will have to hide in your straw pallet. A\nlock presents itself; the bourgeois has in his pocket a key made by a\nlocksmith. If you wish to pass out, you will be condemned to execute a\nterrible work of art; you will take a large sou, you will cut it in\ntwo plates; with what tools? You will have to invent them. That is your\nbusiness. Then you will hollow out the interior of these plates, taking\ngreat care of the outside, and you will make on the edges a thread, so\nthat they can be adjusted one upon the other like a box and its cover.\nThe top and bottom thus screwed together, nothing will be suspected. To\nthe overseers it will be only a sou; to you it will be a box. What will\nyou put in this box? A small bit of steel. A watch-spring, in which you\nwill have cut teeth, and which will form a saw. With this saw, as long\nas a pin, and concealed in a sou, you will cut the bolt of the lock, you\nwill sever bolts, the padlock of your chain, and the bar at your window,\nand the fetter on your leg. This masterpiece finished, this prodigy\naccomplished, all these miracles of art, address, skill, and patience\nexecuted, what will be your recompense if it becomes known that you\nare the author? The dungeon. There is your future. What precipices are\nidleness and pleasure! Do you know that to do nothing is a melancholy\nresolution? To live in idleness on the property of society! to be\nuseless, that is to say, pernicious! This leads straight to the depth\nof wretchedness. Woe to the man who desires to be a parasite! He will\nbecome vermin! Ah! So it does not please you to work? Ah! You have but\none thought, to drink well, to eat well, to sleep well. You will drink\nwater, you will eat black bread, you will sleep on a plank with a fetter\nwhose cold touch you will feel on your flesh all night long, riveted to\nyour limbs. You will break those fetters, you will flee. That is well.\nYou will crawl on your belly through the brushwood, and you will eat\ngrass like the beasts of the forest. And you will be recaptured. And\nthen you will pass years in a dungeon, riveted to a wall, groping for\nyour jug that you may drink, gnawing at a horrible loaf of darkness\nwhich dogs would not touch, eating beans that the worms have eaten\nbefore you. You will be a wood-louse in a cellar. Ah! Have pity on\nyourself, you miserable young child, who were sucking at nurse less\nthan twenty years ago, and who have, no doubt, a mother still alive! I\nconjure you, listen to me, I entreat you. You desire fine black cloth,\nvarnished shoes, to have your hair curled and sweet-smelling oils on\nyour locks, to please low women, to be handsome. You will be shaven\nclean, and you will wear a red blouse and wooden shoes. You want rings\non your fingers, you will have an iron necklet on your neck. If you\nglance at a woman, you will receive a blow. And you will enter there at\nthe age of twenty. And you will come out at fifty! You will enter young,\nrosy, fresh, with brilliant eyes, and all your white teeth, and your\nhandsome, youthful hair; you will come out broken, bent, wrinkled,\ntoothless, horrible, with white locks! Ah! my poor child, you are on the\nwrong road; idleness is counselling you badly; the hardest of all work\nis thieving. Believe me, do not undertake that painful profession of\nan idle man. It is not comfortable to become a rascal. It is less\ndisagreeable to be an honest man. Now go, and ponder on what I have said\nto you. By the way, what did you want of me? My purse? Here it is.\"\n\nAnd the old man, releasing Montparnasse, put his purse in the latter's\nhand; Montparnasse weighed it for a moment, after which he allowed it to\nslide gently into the back pocket of his coat, with the same mechanical\nprecaution as though he had stolen it.\n\nAll this having been said and done, the goodman turned his back and\ntranquilly resumed his stroll.\n\n\"The blockhead!\" muttered Montparnasse.\n\nWho was this goodman? The reader has, no doubt, already divined.\n\nMontparnasse watched him with amazement, as he disappeared in the dusk.\nThis contemplation was fatal to him.\n\nWhile the old man was walking away, Gavroche drew near.\n\nGavroche had assured himself, with a sidelong glance, that Father Mabeuf\nwas still sitting on his bench, probably sound asleep. Then the gamin\nemerged from his thicket, and began to crawl after Montparnasse in the\ndark, as the latter stood there motionless. In this manner he came up\nto Montparnasse without being seen or heard, gently insinuated his hand\ninto the back pocket of that frock-coat of fine black cloth, seized the\npurse, withdrew his hand, and having recourse once more to his crawling,\nhe slipped away like an adder through the shadows. Montparnasse, who\nhad no reason to be on his guard, and who was engaged in thought for the\nfirst time in his life, perceived nothing. When Gavroche had once more\nattained the point where Father Mabeuf was, he flung the purse over the\nhedge, and fled as fast as his legs would carry him.\n\nThe purse fell on Father Mabeuf's foot. This commotion roused him.\n\nHe bent over and picked up the purse.\n\nHe did not understand in the least, and opened it.\n\nThe purse had two compartments; in one of them there was some small\nchange; in the other lay six napoleons.\n\nM. Mabeuf, in great alarm, referred the matter to his housekeeper.\n\n\"That has fallen from heaven,\" said Mother Plutarque.\n\n\n\n\nBOOK FIFTH.--THE END OF WHICH DOES NOT RESEMBLE THE BEGINNING\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I--SOLITUDE AND THE BARRACKS COMBINED\n\nCosette's grief, which had been so poignant and lively four or five\nmonths previously, had, without her being conscious of the fact, entered\nupon its convalescence. Nature, spring, youth, love for her father,\nthe gayety of the birds and flowers, caused something almost resembling\nforgetfulness to filter gradually, drop by drop, into that soul, which\nwas so virgin and so young. Was the fire wholly extinct there? Or was\nit merely that layers of ashes had formed? The truth is, that she hardly\nfelt the painful and burning spot any longer.\n\nOne day she suddenly thought of Marius: \"Why!\" said she, \"I no longer\nthink of him.\"\n\nThat same week, she noticed a very handsome officer of lancers, with\na wasp-like waist, a delicious uniform, the cheeks of a young girl, a\nsword under his arm, waxed mustaches, and a glazed schapka, passing the\ngate. Moreover, he had light hair, prominent blue eyes, a round face,\nwas vain, insolent and good-looking; quite the reverse of Marius. He\nhad a cigar in his mouth. Cosette thought that this officer doubtless\nbelonged to the regiment in barracks in the Rue de Babylone.\n\nOn the following day, she saw him pass again. She took note of the hour.\n\nFrom that time forth, was it chance? she saw him pass nearly every day.\n\nThe officer's comrades perceived that there was, in that \"badly kept\"\ngarden, behind that malicious rococo fence, a very pretty creature,\nwho was almost always there when the handsome lieutenant,--who is not\nunknown to the reader, and whose name was Theodule Gillenormand,--passed\nby.\n\n\"See here!\" they said to him, \"there's a little creature there who is\nmaking eyes at you, look.\"\n\n\"Have I the time,\" replied the lancer, \"to look at all the girls who\nlook at me?\"\n\nThis was at the precise moment when Marius was descending heavily\ntowards agony, and was saying: \"If I could but see her before I\ndie!\"--Had his wish been realized, had he beheld Cosette at that moment\ngazing at the lancer, he would not have been able to utter a word, and\nhe would have expired with grief.\n\nWhose fault was it? No one's.\n\nMarius possessed one of those temperaments which bury themselves in\nsorrow and there abide; Cosette was one of those persons who plunge into\nsorrow and emerge from it again.\n\nCosette was, moreover, passing through that dangerous period, the fatal\nphase of feminine revery abandoned to itself, in which the isolated\nheart of a young girl resembles the tendrils of the vine which cling,\nas chance directs, to the capital of a marble column or to the post of\na wine-shop: A rapid and decisive moment, critical for every orphan, be\nshe rich or poor, for wealth does not prevent a bad choice; misalliances\nare made in very high circles, real misalliance is that of souls; and as\nmany an unknown young man, without name, without birth, without fortune,\nis a marble column which bears up a temple of grand sentiments and grand\nideas, so such and such a man of the world satisfied and opulent, who\nhas polished boots and varnished words, if looked at not outside, but\ninside, a thing which is reserved for his wife, is nothing more than a\nblock obscurely haunted by violent, unclean, and vinous passions; the\npost of a drinking-shop.\n\nWhat did Cosette's soul contain? Passion calmed or lulled to sleep;\nsomething limpid, brilliant, troubled to a certain depth, and gloomy\nlower down. The image of the handsome officer was reflected in\nthe surface. Did a souvenir linger in the depths?--Quite at the\nbottom?--Possibly. Cosette did not know.\n\nA singular incident supervened.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II--COSETTE'S APPREHENSIONS\n\nDuring the first fortnight in April, Jean Valjean took a journey. This,\nas the reader knows, happened from time to time, at very long intervals.\nHe remained absent a day or two days at the utmost. Where did he go? No\none knew, not even Cosette. Once only, on the occasion of one of these\ndepartures, she had accompanied him in a hackney-coach as far as a\nlittle blind-alley at the corner of which she read: Impasse de la\nPlanchette. There he alighted, and the coach took Cosette back to the\nRue de Babylone. It was usually when money was lacking in the house that\nJean Valjean took these little trips.\n\nSo Jean Valjean was absent. He had said: \"I shall return in three days.\"\n\nThat evening, Cosette was alone in the drawing-room. In order to get\nrid of her ennui, she had opened her piano-organ, and had begun to sing,\naccompanying herself the while, the chorus from Euryanthe: \"Hunters\nastray in the wood!\" which is probably the most beautiful thing in all\nthe sphere of music. When she had finished, she remained wrapped in\nthought.\n\nAll at once, it seemed to her that she heard the sound of footsteps in\nthe garden.\n\nIt could not be her father, he was absent; it could not be Toussaint,\nshe was in bed, and it was ten o'clock at night.\n\nShe stepped to the shutter of the drawing-room, which was closed, and\nlaid her ear against it.\n\nIt seemed to her that it was the tread of a man, and that he was walking\nvery softly.\n\nShe mounted rapidly to the first floor, to her own chamber, opened a\nsmall wicket in her shutter, and peeped into the garden. The moon was at\nthe full. Everything could be seen as plainly as by day.\n\nThere was no one there.\n\nShe opened the window. The garden was absolutely calm, and all that was\nvisible was that the street was deserted as usual.\n\nCosette thought that she had been mistaken. She thought that she had\nheard a noise. It was a hallucination produced by the melancholy and\nmagnificent chorus of Weber, which lays open before the mind terrified\ndepths, which trembles before the gaze like a dizzy forest, and in which\none hears the crackling of dead branches beneath the uneasy tread of the\nhuntsmen of whom one catches a glimpse through the twilight.\n\nShe thought no more about it.\n\nMoreover, Cosette was not very timid by nature. There flowed in her\nveins some of the blood of the bohemian and the adventuress who runs\nbarefoot. It will be remembered that she was more of a lark than a dove.\nThere was a foundation of wildness and bravery in her.\n\nOn the following day, at an earlier hour, towards nightfall, she was\nstrolling in the garden. In the midst of the confused thoughts which\noccupied her, she fancied that she caught for an instant a sound similar\nto that of the preceding evening, as though some one were walking\nbeneath the trees in the dusk, and not very far from her; but she told\nherself that nothing so closely resembles a step on the grass as the\nfriction of two branches which have moved from side to side, and she\npaid no heed to it. Besides, she could see nothing.\n\nShe emerged from \"the thicket\"; she had still to cross a small lawn to\nregain the steps.\n\nThe moon, which had just risen behind her, cast Cosette's shadow in\nfront of her upon this lawn, as she came out from the shrubbery.\n\nCosette halted in alarm.\n\nBeside her shadow, the moon outlined distinctly upon the turf another\nshadow, which was particularly startling and terrible, a shadow which\nhad a round hat.\n\nIt was the shadow of a man, who must have been standing on the border of\nthe clump of shrubbery, a few paces in the rear of Cosette.\n\nShe stood for a moment without the power to speak, or cry, or call, or\nstir, or turn her head.\n\nThen she summoned up all her courage, and turned round resolutely.\n\nThere was no one there.\n\nShe glanced on the ground. The figure had disappeared.\n\nShe re-entered the thicket, searched the corners boldly, went as far as\nthe gate, and found nothing.\n\nShe felt herself absolutely chilled with terror. Was this another\nhallucination? What! Two days in succession! One hallucination might\npass, but two hallucinations? The disquieting point about it was, that\nthe shadow had assuredly not been a phantom. Phantoms do not wear round\nhats.\n\nOn the following day Jean Valjean returned. Cosette told him what she\nthought she had heard and seen. She wanted to be reassured and to see\nher father shrug his shoulders and say to her: \"You are a little goose.\"\n\nJean Valjean grew anxious.\n\n\"It cannot be anything,\" said he.\n\nHe left her under some pretext, and went into the garden, and she saw\nhim examining the gate with great attention.\n\nDuring the night she woke up; this time she was sure, and she distinctly\nheard some one walking close to the flight of steps beneath her window.\nShe ran to her little wicket and opened it. In point of fact, there\nwas a man in the garden, with a large club in his hand. Just as she\nwas about to scream, the moon lighted up the man's profile. It was her\nfather. She returned to her bed, saying to herself: \"He is very uneasy!\"\n\nJean Valjean passed that night and the two succeeding nights in the\ngarden. Cosette saw him through the hole in her shutter.\n\nOn the third night, the moon was on the wane, and had begun to rise\nlater; at one o'clock in the morning, possibly, she heard a loud burst\nof laughter and her father's voice calling her:--\n\n\"Cosette!\"\n\nShe jumped out of bed, threw on her dressing-gown, and opened her\nwindow.\n\nHer father was standing on the grass-plot below.\n\n\"I have waked you for the purpose of reassuring you,\" said he; \"look,\nthere is your shadow with the round hat.\"\n\nAnd he pointed out to her on the turf a shadow cast by the moon, and\nwhich did indeed, bear considerable resemblance to the spectre of a man\nwearing a round hat. It was the shadow produced by a chimney-pipe of\nsheet iron, with a hood, which rose above a neighboring roof.\n\nCosette joined in his laughter, all her lugubrious suppositions were\nallayed, and the next morning, as she was at breakfast with her father,\nshe made merry over the sinister garden haunted by the shadows of iron\nchimney-pots.\n\nJean Valjean became quite tranquil once more; as for Cosette, she did\nnot pay much attention to the question whether the chimney-pot was\nreally in the direction of the shadow which she had seen, or thought she\nhad seen, and whether the moon had been in the same spot in the sky.\n\nShe did not question herself as to the peculiarity of a chimney-pot\nwhich is afraid of being caught in the act, and which retires when some\none looks at its shadow, for the shadow had taken the alarm when Cosette\nhad turned round, and Cosette had thought herself very sure of this.\nCosette's serenity was fully restored. The proof appeared to her to\nbe complete, and it quite vanished from her mind, whether there could\npossibly be any one walking in the garden during the evening or at\nnight.\n\nA few days later, however, a fresh incident occurred.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III--ENRICHED WITH COMMENTARIES BY TOUSSAINT\n\nIn the garden, near the railing on the street, there was a stone bench,\nscreened from the eyes of the curious by a plantation of yoke-elms,\nbut which could, in case of necessity, be reached by an arm from the\noutside, past the trees and the gate.\n\nOne evening during that same month of April, Jean Valjean had gone out;\nCosette had seated herself on this bench after sundown. The breeze was\nblowing briskly in the trees, Cosette was meditating; an objectless\nsadness was taking possession of her little by little, that invincible\nsadness evoked by the evening, and which arises, perhaps, who knows,\nfrom the mystery of the tomb which is ajar at that hour.\n\nPerhaps Fantine was within that shadow.\n\nCosette rose, slowly made the tour of the garden, walking on the\ngrass drenched in dew, and saying to herself, through the species of\nmelancholy somnambulism in which she was plunged: \"Really, one needs\nwooden shoes for the garden at this hour. One takes cold.\"\n\nShe returned to the bench.\n\nAs she was about to resume her seat there, she observed on the spot\nwhich she had quitted, a tolerably large stone which had, evidently, not\nbeen there a moment before.\n\nCosette gazed at the stone, asking herself what it meant. All at once\nthe idea occurred to her that the stone had not reached the bench all by\nitself, that some one had placed it there, that an arm had been thrust\nthrough the railing, and this idea appeared to alarm her. This time, the\nfear was genuine; the stone was there. No doubt was possible; she did\nnot touch it, fled without glancing behind her, took refuge in the\nhouse, and immediately closed with shutter, bolt, and bar the door-like\nwindow opening on the flight of steps. She inquired of Toussaint:--\n\n\"Has my father returned yet?\"\n\n\"Not yet, Mademoiselle.\"\n\n[We have already noted once for all the fact that Toussaint stuttered.\nMay we be permitted to dispense with it for the future. The musical\nnotation of an infirmity is repugnant to us.]\n\nJean Valjean, a thoughtful man, and given to nocturnal strolls, often\nreturned quite late at night.\n\n\"Toussaint,\" went on Cosette, \"are you careful to thoroughly barricade\nthe shutters opening on the garden, at least with bars, in the evening,\nand to put the little iron things in the little rings that close them?\"\n\n\"Oh! be easy on that score, Miss.\"\n\nToussaint did not fail in her duty, and Cosette was well aware of the\nfact, but she could not refrain from adding:--\n\n\"It is so solitary here.\"\n\n\"So far as that is concerned,\" said Toussaint, \"it is true. We might be\nassassinated before we had time to say ouf! And Monsieur does not sleep\nin the house, to boot. But fear nothing, Miss, I fasten the shutters up\nlike prisons. Lone women! That is enough to make one shudder, I believe\nyou! Just imagine, what if you were to see men enter your chamber at\nnight and say: 'Hold your tongue!' and begin to cut your throat. It's\nnot the dying so much; you die, for one must die, and that's all right;\nit's the abomination of feeling those people touch you. And then, their\nknives; they can't be able to cut well with them! Ah, good gracious!\"\n\n\"Be quiet,\" said Cosette. \"Fasten everything thoroughly.\"\n\nCosette, terrified by the melodrama improvised by Toussaint, and\npossibly, also, by the recollection of the apparitions of the past week,\nwhich recurred to her memory, dared not even say to her: \"Go and look at\nthe stone which has been placed on the bench!\" for fear of opening the\ngarden gate and allowing \"the men\" to enter. She saw that all the doors\nand windows were carefully fastened, made Toussaint go all over the\nhouse from garret to cellar, locked herself up in her own chamber,\nbolted her door, looked under her couch, went to bed and slept badly.\nAll night long she saw that big stone, as large as a mountain and full\nof caverns.\n\nAt sunrise,--the property of the rising sun is to make us laugh at all\nour terrors of the past night, and our laughter is in direct proportion\nto our terror which they have caused,--at sunrise Cosette, when she\nwoke, viewed her fright as a nightmare, and said to herself: \"What have\nI been thinking of? It is like the footsteps that I thought I heard a\nweek or two ago in the garden at night! It is like the shadow of the\nchimney-pot! Am I becoming a coward?\" The sun, which was glowing through\nthe crevices in her shutters, and turning the damask curtains crimson,\nreassured her to such an extent that everything vanished from her\nthoughts, even the stone.\n\n\"There was no more a stone on the bench than there was a man in a round\nhat in the garden; I dreamed about the stone, as I did all the rest.\"\n\nShe dressed herself, descended to the garden, ran to the bench, and\nbroke out in a cold perspiration. The stone was there.\n\nBut this lasted only for a moment. That which is terror by night is\ncuriosity by day.\n\n\"Bah!\" said she, \"come, let us see what it is.\"\n\nShe lifted the stone, which was tolerably large. Beneath it was\nsomething which resembled a letter. It was a white envelope. Cosette\nseized it. There was no address on one side, no seal on the other.\nYet the envelope, though unsealed, was not empty. Papers could be seen\ninside.\n\nCosette examined it. It was no longer alarm, it was no longer curiosity;\nit was a beginning of anxiety.\n\nCosette drew from the envelope its contents, a little notebook of paper,\neach page of which was numbered and bore a few lines in a very fine and\nrather pretty handwriting, as Cosette thought.\n\nCosette looked for a name; there was none. To whom was this addressed?\nTo her, probably, since a hand had deposited the packet on her bench.\nFrom whom did it come? An irresistible fascination took possession\nof her; she tried to turn away her eyes from the leaflets which were\ntrembling in her hand, she gazed at the sky, the street, the acacias\nall bathed in light, the pigeons fluttering over a neighboring roof,\nand then her glance suddenly fell upon the manuscript, and she said to\nherself that she must know what it contained.\n\nThis is what she read.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV--A HEART BENEATH A STONE\n\n[Illustration: Cosette with Letter  4b4-5-cosette-after-letter]\n\nThe reduction of the universe to a single being, the expansion of a\nsingle being even to God, that is love.\n\n\nLove is the salutation of the angels to the stars.\n\n\nHow sad is the soul, when it is sad through love!\n\n\nWhat a void in the absence of the being who, by herself alone fills the\nworld! Oh! how true it is that the beloved being becomes God. One could\ncomprehend that God might be jealous of this had not God the Father of\nall evidently made creation for the soul, and the soul for love.\n\n\nThe glimpse of a smile beneath a white crape bonnet with a lilac curtain\nis sufficient to cause the soul to enter into the palace of dreams.\n\n\nGod is behind everything, but everything hides God. Things are\nblack, creatures are opaque. To love a being is to render that being\ntransparent.\n\n\nCertain thoughts are prayers. There are moments when, whatever the\nattitude of the body may be, the soul is on its knees.\n\n\nParted lovers beguile absence by a thousand chimerical devices, which\npossess, however, a reality of their own. They are prevented from seeing\neach other, they cannot write to each other; they discover a multitude\nof mysterious means to correspond. They send each other the song of the\nbirds, the perfume of the flowers, the smiles of children, the light of\nthe sun, the sighings of the breeze, the rays of stars, all creation.\nAnd why not? All the works of God are made to serve love. Love is\nsufficiently potent to charge all nature with its messages.\n\nOh Spring! Thou art a letter that I write to her.\n\n\nThe future belongs to hearts even more than it does to minds. Love, that\nis the only thing that can occupy and fill eternity. In the infinite,\nthe inexhaustible is requisite.\n\n\nLove participates of the soul itself. It is of the same nature. Like\nit, it is the divine spark; like it, it is incorruptible, indivisible,\nimperishable. It is a point of fire that exists within us, which is\nimmortal and infinite, which nothing can confine, and which nothing can\nextinguish. We feel it burning even to the very marrow of our bones, and\nwe see it beaming in the very depths of heaven.\n\n\nOh Love! Adorations! voluptuousness of two minds which understand each\nother, of two hearts which exchange with each other, of two glances\nwhich penetrate each other! You will come to me, will you not, bliss!\nstrolls by twos in the solitudes! Blessed and radiant days! I have\nsometimes dreamed that from time to time hours detached themselves from\nthe lives of the angels and came here below to traverse the destinies of\nmen.\n\n\nGod can add nothing to the happiness of those who love, except to give\nthem endless duration. After a life of love, an eternity of love is, in\nfact, an augmentation; but to increase in intensity even the ineffable\nfelicity which love bestows on the soul even in this world, is\nimpossible, even to God. God is the plenitude of heaven; love is the\nplenitude of man.\n\n\nYou look at a star for two reasons, because it is luminous, and because\nit is impenetrable. You have beside you a sweeter radiance and a greater\nmystery, woman.\n\n\nAll of us, whoever we may be, have our respirable beings. We lack\nair and we stifle. Then we die. To die for lack of love is horrible.\nSuffocation of the soul.\n\n\nWhen love has fused and mingled two beings in a sacred and angelic\nunity, the secret of life has been discovered so far as they are\nconcerned; they are no longer anything more than the two boundaries of\nthe same destiny; they are no longer anything but the two wings of the\nsame spirit. Love, soar.\n\n\nOn the day when a woman as she passes before you emits light as she\nwalks, you are lost, you love. But one thing remains for you to do: to\nthink of her so intently that she is constrained to think of you.\n\n\nWhat love commences can be finished by God alone.\n\n\nTrue love is in despair and is enchanted over a glove lost or a\nhandkerchief found, and eternity is required for its devotion and its\nhopes. It is composed both of the infinitely great and the infinitely\nlittle.\n\n\nIf you are a stone, be adamant; if you are a plant, be the sensitive\nplant; if you are a man, be love.\n\n\nNothing suffices for love. We have happiness, we desire paradise; we\npossess paradise, we desire heaven.\n\nOh ye who love each other, all this is contained in love. Understand\nhow to find it there. Love has contemplation as well as heaven, and more\nthan heaven, it has voluptuousness.\n\n\n\"Does she still come to the Luxembourg?\" \"No, sir.\" \"This is the church\nwhere she attends mass, is it not?\" \"She no longer comes here.\" \"Does\nshe still live in this house?\" \"She has moved away.\" \"Where has she gone\nto dwell?\"\n\n\"She did not say.\"\n\nWhat a melancholy thing not to know the address of one's soul!\n\nLove has its childishness, other passions have their pettinesses. Shame\non the passions which belittle man! Honor to the one which makes a child\nof him!\n\n\nThere is one strange thing, do you know it? I dwell in the night. There\nis a being who carried off my sky when she went away.\n\n\nOh! would that we were lying side by side in the same grave, hand\nin hand, and from time to time, in the darkness, gently caressing a\nfinger,--that would suffice for my eternity!\n\n\nYe who suffer because ye love, love yet more. To die of love, is to live\nin it.\n\n\nLove. A sombre and starry transfiguration is mingled with this torture.\nThere is ecstasy in agony.\n\n\nOh joy of the birds! It is because they have nests that they sing.\n\n\nLove is a celestial respiration of the air of paradise.\n\n\nDeep hearts, sage minds, take life as God has made it; it is a long\ntrial, an incomprehensible preparation for an unknown destiny. This\ndestiny, the true one, begins for a man with the first step inside the\ntomb. Then something appears to him, and he begins to distinguish the\ndefinitive. The definitive, meditate upon that word. The living perceive\nthe infinite; the definitive permits itself to be seen only by the dead.\nIn the meanwhile, love and suffer, hope and contemplate. Woe, alas! to\nhim who shall have loved only bodies, forms, appearances! Death will\ndeprive him of all. Try to love souls, you will find them again.\n\n\nI encountered in the street, a very poor young man who was in love. His\nhat was old, his coat was worn, his elbows were in holes; water trickled\nthrough his shoes, and the stars through his soul.\n\n\nWhat a grand thing it is to be loved! What a far grander thing it is\nto love! The heart becomes heroic, by dint of passion. It is no longer\ncomposed of anything but what is pure; it no longer rests on anything\nthat is not elevated and great. An unworthy thought can no more\ngerminate in it, than a nettle on a glacier. The serene and lofty soul,\ninaccessible to vulgar passions and emotions, dominating the clouds\nand the shades of this world, its follies, its lies, its hatreds, its\nvanities, its miseries, inhabits the blue of heaven, and no longer feels\nanything but profound and subterranean shocks of destiny, as the crests\nof mountains feel the shocks of earthquake.\n\n\nIf there did not exist some one who loved, the sun would become extinct.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V--COSETTE AFTER THE LETTER\n\nAs Cosette read, she gradually fell into thought. At the very moment\nwhen she raised her eyes from the last line of the note-book, the\nhandsome officer passed triumphantly in front of the gate,--it was his\nhour; Cosette thought him hideous.\n\nShe resumed her contemplation of the book. It was written in the most\ncharming of chirography, thought Cosette; in the same hand, but with\ndivers inks, sometimes very black, again whitish, as when ink has been\nadded to the inkstand, and consequently on different days. It was,\nthen, a mind which had unfolded itself there, sigh by sigh, irregularly,\nwithout order, without choice, without object, hap-hazard. Cosette\nhad never read anything like it. This manuscript, in which she already\nperceived more light than obscurity, produced upon her the effect of a\nhalf-open sanctuary. Each one of these mysterious lines shone before\nher eyes and inundated her heart with a strange radiance. The education\nwhich she had received had always talked to her of the soul, and never\nof love, very much as one might talk of the firebrand and not of the\nflame. This manuscript of fifteen pages suddenly and sweetly revealed\nto her all of love, sorrow, destiny, life, eternity, the beginning,\nthe end. It was as if a hand had opened and suddenly flung upon her\na handful of rays of light. In these few lines she felt a passionate,\nardent, generous, honest nature, a sacred will, an immense sorrow, and\nan immense despair, a suffering heart, an ecstasy fully expanded. What\nwas this manuscript? A letter. A letter without name, without address,\nwithout date, without signature, pressing and disinterested, an enigma\ncomposed of truths, a message of love made to be brought by an angel and\nread by a virgin, an appointment made beyond the bounds of earth, the\nlove-letter of a phantom to a shade. It was an absent one, tranquil and\ndejected, who seemed ready to take refuge in death and who sent to the\nabsent love, his lady, the secret of fate, the key of life, love. This\nhad been written with one foot in the grave and one finger in heaven.\nThese lines, which had fallen one by one on the paper, were what might\nbe called drops of soul.\n\nNow, from whom could these pages come? Who could have penned them?\n\nCosette did not hesitate a moment. One man only.\n\nHe!\n\nDay had dawned once more in her spirit; all had reappeared. She felt an\nunheard-of joy, and a profound anguish. It was he! he who had written!\nhe was there! it was he whose arm had been thrust through that railing!\nWhile she was forgetful of him, he had found her again! But had she\nforgotten him? No, never! She was foolish to have thought so for a\nsingle moment. She had always loved him, always adored him. The fire had\nbeen smothered, and had smouldered for a time, but she saw all plainly\nnow; it had but made headway, and now it had burst forth afresh, and\nhad inflamed her whole being. This note-book was like a spark which\nhad fallen from that other soul into hers. She felt the conflagration\nstarting up once more.\n\nShe imbued herself thoroughly with every word of the manuscript: \"Oh\nyes!\" said she, \"how perfectly I recognize all that! That is what I had\nalready read in his eyes.\" As she was finishing it for the third time,\nLieutenant Theodule passed the gate once more, and rattled his spurs\nupon the pavement. Cosette was forced to raise her eyes. She thought him\ninsipid, silly, stupid, useless, foppish, displeasing, impertinent, and\nextremely ugly. The officer thought it his duty to smile at her.\n\nShe turned away as in shame and indignation. She would gladly have\nthrown something at his head.\n\nShe fled, re-entered the house, and shut herself up in her chamber to\nperuse the manuscript once more, to learn it by heart, and to dream.\nWhen she had thoroughly mastered it she kissed it and put it in her\nbosom.\n\nAll was over, Cosette had fallen back into deep, seraphic love. The\nabyss of Eden had yawned once more.\n\nAll day long, Cosette remained in a sort of bewilderment. She scarcely\nthought, her ideas were in the state of a tangled skein in her brain,\nshe could not manage to conjecture anything, she hoped through a tremor,\nwhat? vague things. She dared make herself no promises, and she did\nnot wish to refuse herself anything. Flashes of pallor passed over her\ncountenance, and shivers ran through her frame. It seemed to her, at\nintervals, that she was entering the land of chimaeras; she said to\nherself: \"Is this reality?\" Then she felt of the dear paper within her\nbosom under her gown, she pressed it to her heart, she felt its angles\nagainst her flesh; and if Jean Valjean had seen her at the moment, he\nwould have shuddered in the presence of that luminous and unknown joy,\nwhich overflowed from beneath her eyelids.--\"Oh yes!\" she thought, \"it\nis certainly he! This comes from him, and is for me!\"\n\nAnd she told herself that an intervention of the angels, a celestial\nchance, had given him back to her.\n\nOh transfiguration of love! Oh dreams! That celestial chance, that\nintervention of the angels, was a pellet of bread tossed by one thief to\nanother thief, from the Charlemagne Courtyard to the Lion's Ditch, over\nthe roofs of La Force.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI--OLD PEOPLE ARE MADE TO GO OUT OPPORTUNELY\n\nWhen evening came, Jean Valjean went out; Cosette dressed herself. She\narranged her hair in the most becoming manner, and she put on a dress\nwhose bodice had received one snip of the scissors too much, and which,\nthrough this slope, permitted a view of the beginning of her throat, and\nwas, as young girls say, \"a trifle indecent.\" It was not in the least\nindecent, but it was prettier than usual. She made her toilet thus\nwithout knowing why she did so.\n\nDid she mean to go out? No.\n\nWas she expecting a visitor? No.\n\nAt dusk, she went down to the garden. Toussaint was busy in her kitchen,\nwhich opened on the back yard.\n\nShe began to stroll about under the trees, thrusting aside the branches\nfrom time to time with her hand, because there were some which hung very\nlow.\n\nIn this manner she reached the bench.\n\nThe stone was still there.\n\nShe sat down, and gently laid her white hand on this stone as though she\nwished to caress and thank it.\n\nAll at once, she experienced that indefinable impression which one\nundergoes when there is some one standing behind one, even when she does\nnot see the person.\n\nShe turned her head and rose to her feet.\n\nIt was he.\n\nHis head was bare. He appeared to have grown thin and pale. His black\nclothes were hardly discernible. The twilight threw a wan light on\nhis fine brow, and covered his eyes in shadows. Beneath a veil of\nincomparable sweetness, he had something about him that suggested death\nand night. His face was illuminated by the light of the dying day, and\nby the thought of a soul that is taking flight.\n\nHe seemed to be not yet a ghost, and he was no longer a man.\n\nHe had flung away his hat in the thicket, a few paces distant.\n\nCosette, though ready to swoon, uttered no cry. She retreated slowly,\nfor she felt herself attracted. He did not stir. By virtue of something\nineffable and melancholy which enveloped him, she felt the look in his\neyes which she could not see.\n\nCosette, in her retreat, encountered a tree and leaned against it. Had\nit not been for this tree, she would have fallen.\n\nThen she heard his voice, that voice which she had really never heard,\nbarely rising above the rustle of the leaves, and murmuring:--\n\n\"Pardon me, here I am. My heart is full. I could not live on as I was\nliving, and I have come. Have you read what I placed there on the bench?\nDo you recognize me at all? Have no fear of me. It is a long time, you\nremember the day, since you looked at me at the Luxembourg, near the\nGladiator. And the day when you passed before me? It was on the 16th of\nJune and the 2d of July. It is nearly a year ago. I have not seen you\nfor a long time. I inquired of the woman who let the chairs, and she\ntold me that she no longer saw you. You lived in the Rue de l'Ouest, on\nthe third floor, in the front apartments of a new house,--you see that\nI know! I followed you. What else was there for me to do? And then you\ndisappeared. I thought I saw you pass once, while I was reading the\nnewspapers under the arcade of the Odeon. I ran after you. But no. It\nwas a person who had a bonnet like yours. At night I came hither. Do\nnot be afraid, no one sees me. I come to gaze upon your windows near\nat hand. I walk very softly, so that you may not hear, for you might be\nalarmed. The other evening I was behind you, you turned round, I fled.\nOnce, I heard you singing. I was happy. Did it affect you because I\nheard you singing through the shutters? That could not hurt you. No,\nit is not so? You see, you are my angel! Let me come sometimes; I think\nthat I am going to die. If you only knew! I adore you. Forgive me, I\nspeak to you, but I do not know what I am saying; I may have displeased\nyou; have I displeased you?\"\n\n\"Oh! my mother!\" said she.\n\nAnd she sank down as though on the point of death.\n\nHe grasped her, she fell, he took her in his arms, he pressed her close,\nwithout knowing what he was doing. He supported her, though he was\ntottering himself. It was as though his brain were full of smoke;\nlightnings darted between his lips; his ideas vanished; it seemed to him\nthat he was accomplishing some religious act, and that he was committing\na profanation. Moreover, he had not the least passion for this lovely\nwoman whose force he felt against his breast. He was beside himself with\nlove.\n\nShe took his hand and laid it on her heart. He felt the paper there, he\nstammered:--\n\n\"You love me, then?\"\n\nShe replied in a voice so low that it was no longer anything more than a\nbarely audible breath:--\n\n\"Hush! Thou knowest it!\"\n\nAnd she hid her blushing face on the breast of the superb and\nintoxicated young man.\n\nHe fell upon the bench, and she beside him. They had no words more. The\nstars were beginning to gleam. How did it come to pass that their lips\nmet? How comes it to pass that the birds sing, that snow melts, that\nthe rose unfolds, that May expands, that the dawn grows white behind the\nblack trees on the shivering crest of the hills?\n\nA kiss, and that was all.\n\nBoth started, and gazed into the darkness with sparkling eyes.\n\nThey felt neither the cool night, nor the cold stone, nor the damp\nearth, nor the wet grass; they looked at each other, and their hearts\nwere full of thoughts. They had clasped hands unconsciously.\n\nShe did not ask him, she did not even wonder, how he had entered there,\nand how he had made his way into the garden. It seemed so simple to her\nthat he should be there!\n\nFrom time to time, Marius' knee touched Cosette's knee, and both\nshivered.\n\nAt intervals, Cosette stammered a word. Her soul fluttered on her lips\nlike a drop of dew on a flower.\n\nLittle by little they began to talk to each other. Effusion followed\nsilence, which is fulness. The night was serene and splendid overhead.\nThese two beings, pure as spirits, told each other everything, their\ndreams, their intoxications, their ecstasies, their chimaeras, their\nweaknesses, how they had adored each other from afar, how they had\nlonged for each other, their despair when they had ceased to see each\nother. They confided to each other in an ideal intimacy, which nothing\ncould augment, their most secret and most mysterious thoughts. They\nrelated to each other, with candid faith in their illusions, all that\nlove, youth, and the remains of childhood which still lingered about\nthem, suggested to their minds. Their two hearts poured themselves out\ninto each other in such wise, that at the expiration of a quarter of an\nhour, it was the young man who had the young girl's soul, and the young\ngirl who had the young man's soul. Each became permeated with the other,\nthey were enchanted with each other, they dazzled each other.\n\nWhen they had finished, when they had told each other everything, she\nlaid her head on his shoulder and asked him:--\n\n\"What is your name?\"\n\n\"My name is Marius,\" said he. \"And yours?\"\n\n\"My name is Cosette.\"\n\n\n\n\nBOOK SIXTH.--LITTLE GAVROCHE\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I--THE MALICIOUS PLAYFULNESS OF THE WIND\n\nSince 1823, when the tavern of Montfermeil was on the way to shipwreck\nand was being gradually engulfed, not in the abyss of a bankruptcy, but\nin the cesspool of petty debts, the Thenardier pair had had two other\nchildren; both males. That made five; two girls and three boys.\n\nMadame Thenardier had got rid of the last two, while they were still\nyoung and very small, with remarkable luck.\n\nGot rid of is the word. There was but a mere fragment of nature in that\nwoman. A phenomenon, by the way, of which there is more than one example\nextant. Like the Marechale de La Mothe-Houdancourt, the Thenardier was\na mother to her daughters only. There her maternity ended. Her hatred of\nthe human race began with her own sons. In the direction of her sons her\nevil disposition was uncompromising, and her heart had a lugubrious wall\nin that quarter. As the reader has seen, she detested the eldest; she\ncursed the other two. Why? Because. The most terrible of motives, the\nmost unanswerable of retorts--Because. \"I have no need of a litter of\nsqualling brats,\" said this mother.\n\nLet us explain how the Thenardiers had succeeded in getting rid of their\nlast two children; and even in drawing profit from the operation.\n\nThe woman Magnon, who was mentioned a few pages further back, was the\nsame one who had succeeded in making old Gillenormand support the two\nchildren which she had had. She lived on the Quai des Celestins, at the\ncorner of this ancient street of the Petit-Musc which afforded her the\nopportunity of changing her evil repute into good odor. The reader will\nremember the great epidemic of croup which ravaged the river districts\nof the Seine in Paris thirty-five years ago, and of which science took\nadvantage to make experiments on a grand scale as to the efficacy of\ninhalations of alum, so beneficially replaced at the present day by the\nexternal tincture of iodine. During this epidemic, the Magnon lost both\nher boys, who were still very young, one in the morning, the other\nin the evening of the same day. This was a blow. These children were\nprecious to their mother; they represented eighty francs a month. These\neighty francs were punctually paid in the name of M. Gillenormand, by\ncollector of his rents, M. Barge, a retired tip-staff, in the Rue du\nRoi-de-Sicile. The children dead, the income was at an end. The Magnon\nsought an expedient. In that dark free-masonry of evil of which she\nformed a part, everything is known, all secrets are kept, and all lend\nmutual aid. Magnon needed two children; the Thenardiers had two.\nThe same sex, the same age. A good arrangement for the one, a good\ninvestment for the other. The little Thenardiers became little Magnons.\nMagnon quitted the Quai des Celestins and went to live in the Rue\nClocheperce. In Paris, the identity which binds an individual to himself\nis broken between one street and another.\n\nThe registry office being in no way warned, raised no objections, and\nthe substitution was effected in the most simple manner in the world.\nOnly, the Thenardier exacted for this loan of her children, ten francs a\nmonth, which Magnon promised to pay, and which she actually did pay.\nIt is unnecessary to add that M. Gillenormand continued to perform\nhis compact. He came to see the children every six months. He did not\nperceive the change. \"Monsieur,\" Magnon said to him, \"how much they\nresemble you!\"\n\nThenardier, to whom avatars were easy, seized this occasion to become\nJondrette. His two daughters and Gavroche had hardly had time to\ndiscover that they had two little brothers. When a certain degree\nof misery is reached, one is overpowered with a sort of spectral\nindifference, and one regards human beings as though they were spectres.\nYour nearest relations are often no more for you than vague shadowy\nforms, barely outlined against a nebulous background of life and easily\nconfounded again with the invisible.\n\nOn the evening of the day when she had handed over her two little\nones to Magnon, with express intention of renouncing them forever, the\nThenardier had felt, or had appeared to feel, a scruple. She said to her\nhusband: \"But this is abandoning our children!\" Thenardier, masterful\nand phlegmatic, cauterized the scruple with this saying: \"Jean Jacques\nRousseau did even better!\" From scruples, the mother proceeded to\nuneasiness: \"But what if the police were to annoy us? Tell me, Monsieur\nThenardier, is what we have done permissible?\" Thenardier replied:\n\"Everything is permissible. No one will see anything but true blue in\nit. Besides, no one has any interest in looking closely after children\nwho have not a sou.\"\n\nMagnon was a sort of fashionable woman in the sphere of crime. She was\ncareful about her toilet. She shared her lodgings, which were furnished\nin an affected and wretched style, with a clever gallicized English\nthief. This English woman, who had become a naturalized Parisienne,\nrecommended by very wealthy relations, intimately connected with the\nmedals in the Library and Mademoiselle Mar's diamonds, became celebrated\nlater on in judicial accounts. She was called Mamselle Miss.\n\nThe two little creatures who had fallen to Magnon had no reason to\ncomplain of their lot. Recommended by the eighty francs, they were well\ncared for, as is everything from which profit is derived; they were\nneither badly clothed, nor badly fed; they were treated almost like\n\"little gentlemen,\"--better by their false mother than by their real\none. Magnon played the lady, and talked no thieves' slang in their\npresence.\n\nThus passed several years. Thenardier augured well from the fact. One\nday, he chanced to say to Magnon as she handed him his monthly stipend\nof ten francs: \"The father must give them some education.\"\n\nAll at once, these two poor children, who had up to that time been\nprotected tolerably well, even by their evil fate, were abruptly hurled\ninto life and forced to begin it for themselves.\n\nA wholesale arrest of malefactors, like that in the Jondrette garret,\nnecessarily complicated by investigations and subsequent incarcerations,\nis a veritable disaster for that hideous and occult counter-society\nwhich pursues its existence beneath public society; an adventure of this\ndescription entails all sorts of catastrophes in that sombre world. The\nThenardier catastrophe involved the catastrophe of Magnon.\n\n\nOne day, a short time after Magnon had handed to Eponine the note\nrelating to the Rue Plumet, a sudden raid was made by the police in the\nRue Clocheperce; Magnon was seized, as was also Mamselle Miss; and all\nthe inhabitants of the house, which was of a suspicious character, were\ngathered into the net. While this was going on, the two little boys were\nplaying in the back yard, and saw nothing of the raid. When they tried\nto enter the house again, they found the door fastened and the house\nempty. A cobbler opposite called them to him, and delivered to them a\npaper which \"their mother\" had left for them. On this paper there was an\naddress: M. Barge, collector of rents, Rue du Roi-de-Sicile, No. 8. The\nproprietor of the stall said to them: \"You cannot live here any longer.\nGo there. It is near by. The first street on the left. Ask your way from\nthis paper.\"\n\nThe children set out, the elder leading the younger, and holding in his\nhand the paper which was to guide them. It was cold, and his benumbed\nlittle fingers could not close very firmly, and they did not keep a very\ngood hold on the paper. At the corner of the Rue Clocheperce, a gust of\nwind tore it from him, and as night was falling, the child was not able\nto find it again.\n\nThey began to wander aimlessly through the streets.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II--IN WHICH LITTLE GAVROCHE EXTRACTS PROFIT FROM NAPOLEON THE\nGREAT\n\nSpring in Paris is often traversed by harsh and piercing breezes which\ndo not precisely chill but freeze one; these north winds which sadden\nthe most beautiful days produce exactly the effect of those puffs of\ncold air which enter a warm room through the cracks of a badly fitting\ndoor or window. It seems as though the gloomy door of winter had\nremained ajar, and as though the wind were pouring through it. In the\nspring of 1832, the epoch when the first great epidemic of this century\nbroke out in Europe, these north gales were more harsh and piercing\nthan ever. It was a door even more glacial than that of winter which\nwas ajar. It was the door of the sepulchre. In these winds one felt the\nbreath of the cholera.\n\nFrom a meteorological point of view, these cold winds possessed this\npeculiarity, that they did not preclude a strong electric tension.\nFrequent storms, accompanied by thunder and lightning, burst forth at\nthis epoch.\n\nOne evening, when these gales were blowing rudely, to such a degree that\nJanuary seemed to have returned and that the bourgeois had resumed their\ncloaks, Little Gavroche, who was always shivering gayly under his rags,\nwas standing as though in ecstasy before a wig-maker's shop in the\nvicinity of the Orme-Saint-Gervais. He was adorned with a woman's\nwoollen shawl, picked up no one knows where, and which he had converted\ninto a neck comforter. Little Gavroche appeared to be engaged in intent\nadmiration of a wax bride, in a low-necked dress, and crowned with\norange-flowers, who was revolving in the window, and displaying her\nsmile to passers-by, between two argand lamps; but in reality, he was\ntaking an observation of the shop, in order to discover whether he\ncould not \"prig\" from the shop-front a cake of soap, which he would then\nproceed to sell for a sou to a \"hair-dresser\" in the suburbs. He had\noften managed to breakfast off of such a roll. He called his species of\nwork, for which he possessed special aptitude, \"shaving barbers.\"\n\nWhile contemplating the bride, and eyeing the cake of soap, he muttered\nbetween his teeth: \"Tuesday. It was not Tuesday. Was it Tuesday? Perhaps\nit was Tuesday. Yes, it was Tuesday.\"\n\nNo one has ever discovered to what this monologue referred.\n\nYes, perchance, this monologue had some connection with the last\noccasion on which he had dined, three days before, for it was now\nFriday.\n\nThe barber in his shop, which was warmed by a good stove, was shaving\na customer and casting a glance from time to time at the enemy, that\nfreezing and impudent street urchin both of whose hands were in his\npockets, but whose mind was evidently unsheathed.\n\nWhile Gavroche was scrutinizing the shop-window and the cakes of windsor\nsoap, two children of unequal stature, very neatly dressed, and still\nsmaller than himself, one apparently about seven years of age, the other\nfive, timidly turned the handle and entered the shop, with a request for\nsomething or other, alms possibly, in a plaintive murmur which resembled\na groan rather than a prayer. They both spoke at once, and their words\nwere unintelligible because sobs broke the voice of the younger, and the\nteeth of the elder were chattering with cold. The barber wheeled round\nwith a furious look, and without abandoning his razor, thrust back the\nelder with his left hand and the younger with his knee, and slammed\nhis door, saying: \"The idea of coming in and freezing everybody for\nnothing!\"\n\nThe two children resumed their march in tears. In the meantime, a cloud\nhad risen; it had begun to rain.\n\nLittle Gavroche ran after them and accosted them:--\n\n\"What's the matter with you, brats?\"\n\n\"We don't know where we are to sleep,\" replied the elder.\n\n\"Is that all?\" said Gavroche. \"A great matter, truly. The idea of\nbawling about that. They must be greenies!\"\n\nAnd adopting, in addition to his superiority, which was rather\nbantering, an accent of tender authority and gentle patronage:--\n\n\"Come along with me, young 'uns!\"\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" said the elder.\n\nAnd the two children followed him as they would have followed an\narchbishop. They had stopped crying.\n\nGavroche led them up the Rue Saint-Antoine in the direction of the\nBastille.\n\nAs Gavroche walked along, he cast an indignant backward glance at the\nbarber's shop.\n\n\"That fellow has no heart, the whiting,\"[35] he muttered. \"He's an\nEnglishman.\"\n\nA woman who caught sight of these three marching in a file, with\nGavroche at their head, burst into noisy laughter. This laugh was\nwanting in respect towards the group.\n\n\"Good day, Mamselle Omnibus,\" said Gavroche to her.\n\nAn instant later, the wig-maker occurred to his mind once more, and he\nadded:--\n\n\"I am making a mistake in the beast; he's not a whiting, he's a serpent.\nBarber, I'll go and fetch a locksmith, and I'll have a bell hung to your\ntail.\"\n\nThis wig-maker had rendered him aggressive. As he strode over a gutter,\nhe apostrophized a bearded portress who was worthy to meet Faust on the\nBrocken, and who had a broom in her hand.\n\n\"Madam,\" said he, \"so you are going out with your horse?\"\n\nAnd thereupon, he spattered the polished boots of a pedestrian.\n\n\"You scamp!\" shouted the furious pedestrian.\n\nGavroche elevated his nose above his shawl.\n\n\"Is Monsieur complaining?\"\n\n\"Of you!\" ejaculated the man.\n\n\"The office is closed,\" said Gavroche, \"I do not receive any more\ncomplaints.\"\n\nIn the meanwhile, as he went on up the street, he perceived a\nbeggar-girl, thirteen or fourteen years old, and clad in so short a\ngown that her knees were visible, lying thoroughly chilled under a\nporte-cochere. The little girl was getting to be too old for such a\nthing. Growth does play these tricks. The petticoat becomes short at the\nmoment when nudity becomes indecent.\n\n\"Poor girl!\" said Gavroche. \"She hasn't even trousers. Hold on, take\nthis.\"\n\nAnd unwinding all the comfortable woollen which he had around his neck,\nhe flung it on the thin and purple shoulders of the beggar-girl, where\nthe scarf became a shawl once more.\n\nThe child stared at him in astonishment, and received the shawl in\nsilence. When a certain stage of distress has been reached in his\nmisery, the poor man no longer groans over evil, no longer returns\nthanks for good.\n\nThat done: \"Brrr!\" said Gavroche, who was shivering more than Saint\nMartin, for the latter retained one-half of his cloak.\n\nAt this brrr! the downpour of rain, redoubled in its spite, became\nfurious. The wicked skies punish good deeds.\n\n\"Ah, come now!\" exclaimed Gavroche, \"what's the meaning of this? It's\nre-raining! Good Heavens, if it goes on like this, I shall stop my\nsubscription.\"\n\nAnd he set out on the march once more.\n\n\"It's all right,\" he resumed, casting a glance at the beggar-girl, as\nshe coiled up under the shawl, \"she's got a famous peel.\"\n\nAnd looking up at the clouds he exclaimed:--\n\n\"Caught!\"\n\nThe two children followed close on his heels.\n\nAs they were passing one of these heavy grated lattices, which indicate\na baker's shop, for bread is put behind bars like gold, Gavroche turned\nround:--\n\n\"Ah, by the way, brats, have we dined?\"\n\n\"Monsieur,\" replied the elder, \"we have had nothing to eat since this\nmorning.\"\n\n\"So you have neither father nor mother?\" resumed Gavroche majestically.\n\n\"Excuse us, sir, we have a papa and a mamma, but we don't know where\nthey are.\"\n\n\"Sometimes that's better than knowing where they are,\" said Gavroche,\nwho was a thinker.\n\n\"We have been wandering about these two hours,\" continued the elder, \"we\nhave hunted for things at the corners of the streets, but we have found\nnothing.\"\n\n\"I know,\" ejaculated Gavroche, \"it's the dogs who eat everything.\"\n\nHe went on, after a pause:--\n\n\"Ah! we have lost our authors. We don't know what we have done with\nthem. This should not be, gamins. It's stupid to let old people stray\noff like that. Come now! we must have a snooze all the same.\"\n\nHowever, he asked them no questions. What was more simple than that they\nshould have no dwelling place!\n\nThe elder of the two children, who had almost entirely recovered the\nprompt heedlessness of childhood, uttered this exclamation:--\n\n\"It's queer, all the same. Mamma told us that she would take us to get a\nblessed spray on Palm Sunday.\"\n\n\"Bosh,\" said Gavroche.\n\n\"Mamma,\" resumed the elder, \"is a lady who lives with Mamselle Miss.\"\n\n\"Tanflute!\" retorted Gavroche.\n\nMeanwhile he had halted, and for the last two minutes he had been\nfeeling and fumbling in all sorts of nooks which his rags contained.\n\nAt last he tossed his head with an air intended to be merely satisfied,\nbut which was triumphant, in reality.\n\n\"Let us be calm, young 'uns. Here's supper for three.\"\n\nAnd from one of his pockets he drew forth a sou.\n\nWithout allowing the two urchins time for amazement, he pushed both of\nthem before him into the baker's shop, and flung his sou on the counter,\ncrying:--\n\n\"Boy! five centimes' worth of bread.\"\n\nThe baker, who was the proprietor in person, took up a loaf and a knife.\n\n\"In three pieces, my boy!\" went on Gavroche.\n\nAnd he added with dignity:--\n\n\"There are three of us.\"\n\nAnd seeing that the baker, after scrutinizing the three customers, had\ntaken down a black loaf, he thrust his finger far up his nose with\nan inhalation as imperious as though he had had a pinch of the great\nFrederick's snuff on the tip of his thumb, and hurled this indignant\napostrophe full in the baker's face:--\n\n\"Keksekca?\"\n\nThose of our readers who might be tempted to espy in this interpellation\nof Gavroche's to the baker a Russian or a Polish word, or one of those\nsavage cries which the Yoways and the Botocudos hurl at each other from\nbank to bank of a river, athwart the solitudes, are warned that it is a\nword which they [our readers] utter every day, and which takes the place\nof the phrase: \"Qu'est-ce que c'est que cela?\" The baker understood\nperfectly, and replied:--\n\n\"Well! It's bread, and very good bread of the second quality.\"\n\n\"You mean larton brutal [black bread]!\" retorted Gavroche, calmly and\ncoldly disdainful. \"White bread, boy! white bread [larton savonne]! I'm\nstanding treat.\"\n\nThe baker could not repress a smile, and as he cut the white bread he\nsurveyed them in a compassionate way which shocked Gavroche.\n\n\"Come, now, baker's boy!\" said he, \"what are you taking our measure like\nthat for?\"\n\nAll three of them placed end to end would have hardly made a measure.\n\nWhen the bread was cut, the baker threw the sou into his drawer, and\nGavroche said to the two children:--\n\n\"Grub away.\"\n\nThe little boys stared at him in surprise.\n\nGavroche began to laugh.\n\n\"Ah! hullo, that's so! they don't understand yet, they're too small.\"\n\nAnd he repeated:--\n\n\"Eat away.\"\n\nAt the same time, he held out a piece of bread to each of them.\n\nAnd thinking that the elder, who seemed to him the more worthy of\nhis conversation, deserved some special encouragement and ought to be\nrelieved from all hesitation to satisfy his appetite, he added, as be\nhanded him the largest share:--\n\n\"Ram that into your muzzle.\"\n\nOne piece was smaller than the others; he kept this for himself.\n\nThe poor children, including Gavroche, were famished. As they tore their\nbread apart in big mouthfuls, they blocked up the shop of the baker,\nwho, now that they had paid their money, looked angrily at them.\n\n\"Let's go into the street again,\" said Gavroche.\n\nThey set off once more in the direction of the Bastille.\n\nFrom time to time, as they passed the lighted shop-windows, the smallest\nhalted to look at the time on a leaden watch which was suspended from\nhis neck by a cord.\n\n\"Well, he is a very green 'un,\" said Gavroche.\n\nThen, becoming thoughtful, he muttered between his teeth:--\n\n\"All the same, if I had charge of the babes I'd lock 'em up better than\nthat.\"\n\nJust as they were finishing their morsel of bread, and had reached the\nangle of that gloomy Rue des Ballets, at the other end of which the low\nand threatening wicket of La Force was visible:--\n\n\"Hullo, is that you, Gavroche?\" said some one.\n\n\"Hullo, is that you, Montparnasse?\" said Gavroche.\n\nA man had just accosted the street urchin, and the man was no other\nthan Montparnasse in disguise, with blue spectacles, but recognizable to\nGavroche.\n\n\"The bow-wows!\" went on Gavroche, \"you've got a hide the color of a\nlinseed plaster, and blue specs like a doctor. You're putting on style,\n'pon my word!\"\n\n\"Hush!\" ejaculated Montparnasse, \"not so loud.\"\n\nAnd he drew Gavroche hastily out of range of the lighted shops.\n\nThe two little ones followed mechanically, holding each other by the\nhand.\n\nWhen they were ensconced under the arch of a portecochere, sheltered\nfrom the rain and from all eyes:--\n\n\"Do you know where I'm going?\" demanded Montparnasse.\n\n\"To the Abbey of Ascend-with-Regret,\"[36] replied Gavroche.\n\n\"Joker!\"\n\nAnd Montparnasse went on:--\n\n\"I'm going to find Babet.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" exclaimed Gavroche, \"so her name is Babet.\"\n\nMontparnasse lowered his voice:--\n\n\"Not she, he.\"\n\n\"Ah! Babet.\"\n\n\"Yes, Babet.\"\n\n\"I thought he was buckled.\"\n\n\"He has undone the buckle,\" replied Montparnasse.\n\nAnd he rapidly related to the gamin how, on the morning of that very\nday, Babet, having been transferred to La Conciergerie, had made his\nescape, by turning to the left instead of to the right in \"the police\noffice.\"\n\nGavroche expressed his admiration for this skill.\n\n\"What a dentist!\" he cried.\n\nMontparnasse added a few details as to Babet's flight, and ended with:--\n\n\"Oh! That's not all.\"\n\nGavroche, as he listened, had seized a cane that Montparnasse held in\nhis hand, and mechanically pulled at the upper part, and the blade of a\ndagger made its appearance.\n\n\"Ah!\" he exclaimed, pushing the dagger back in haste, \"you have brought\nalong your gendarme disguised as a bourgeois.\"\n\nMontparnasse winked.\n\n\"The deuce!\" resumed Gavroche, \"so you're going to have a bout with the\nbobbies?\"\n\n\"You can't tell,\" replied Montparnasse with an indifferent air. \"It's\nalways a good thing to have a pin about one.\"\n\nGavroche persisted:--\n\n\"What are you up to to-night?\"\n\nAgain Montparnasse took a grave tone, and said, mouthing every syllable:\n\"Things.\"\n\nAnd abruptly changing the conversation:--\n\n\"By the way!\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"Something happened t'other day. Fancy. I meet a bourgeois. He makes\nme a present of a sermon and his purse. I put it in my pocket. A minute\nlater, I feel in my pocket. There's nothing there.\"\n\n\"Except the sermon,\" said Gavroche.\n\n\"But you,\" went on Montparnasse, \"where are you bound for now?\"\n\nGavroche pointed to his two proteges, and said:--\n\n\"I'm going to put these infants to bed.\"\n\n\"Whereabouts is the bed?\"\n\n\"At my house.\"\n\n\"Where's your house?\"\n\n\"At my house.\"\n\n\"So you have a lodging?\"\n\n\"Yes, I have.\"\n\n\"And where is your lodging?\"\n\n\"In the elephant,\" said Gavroche.\n\nMontparnasse, though not naturally inclined to astonishment, could not\nrestrain an exclamation.\n\n\"In the elephant!\"\n\n\"Well, yes, in the elephant!\" retorted Gavroche. \"Kekcaa?\"\n\nThis is another word of the language which no one writes, and which\nevery one speaks.\n\nKekcaa signifies: Quest que c'est que cela a? [What's the matter with\nthat?]\n\nThe urchin's profound remark recalled Montparnasse to calmness and\ngood sense. He appeared to return to better sentiments with regard to\nGavroche's lodging.\n\n\"Of course,\" said he, \"yes, the elephant. Is it comfortable there?\"\n\n\"Very,\" said Gavroche. \"It's really bully there. There ain't any\ndraughts, as there are under the bridges.\"\n\n\"How do you get in?\"\n\n\"Oh, I get in.\"\n\n\"So there is a hole?\" demanded Montparnasse.\n\n\"Parbleu! I should say so. But you mustn't tell. It's between the fore\nlegs. The bobbies haven't seen it.\"\n\n\"And you climb up? Yes, I understand.\"\n\n\"A turn of the hand, cric, crac, and it's all over, no one there.\"\n\nAfter a pause, Gavroche added:--\n\n\"I shall have a ladder for these children.\"\n\nMontparnasse burst out laughing:--\n\n\"Where the devil did you pick up those young 'uns?\"\n\nGavroche replied with great simplicity:--\n\n\"They are some brats that a wig-maker made me a present of.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Montparnasse had fallen to thinking:--\n\n\"You recognized me very readily,\" he muttered.\n\nHe took from his pocket two small objects which were nothing more than\ntwo quills wrapped in cotton, and thrust one up each of his nostrils.\nThis gave him a different nose.\n\n\"That changes you,\" remarked Gavroche, \"you are less homely so, you\nought to keep them on all the time.\"\n\nMontparnasse was a handsome fellow, but Gavroche was a tease.\n\n\"Seriously,\" demanded Montparnasse, \"how do you like me so?\"\n\nThe sound of his voice was different also. In a twinkling, Montparnasse\nhad become unrecognizable.\n\n\"Oh! Do play Porrichinelle for us!\" exclaimed Gavroche.\n\nThe two children, who had not been listening up to this point, being\noccupied themselves in thrusting their fingers up their noses, drew\nnear at this name, and stared at Montparnasse with dawning joy and\nadmiration.\n\nUnfortunately, Montparnasse was troubled.\n\nHe laid his hand on Gavroche's shoulder, and said to him, emphasizing\nhis words: \"Listen to what I tell you, boy! if I were on the square with\nmy dog, my knife, and my wife, and if you were to squander ten sous on\nme, I wouldn't refuse to work, but this isn't Shrove Tuesday.\"\n\nThis odd phrase produced a singular effect on the gamin. He wheeled\nround hastily, darted his little sparkling eyes about him with profound\nattention, and perceived a police sergeant standing with his back to\nthem a few paces off. Gavroche allowed an: \"Ah! good!\" to escape him,\nbut immediately suppressed it, and shaking Montparnasse's hand:--\n\n\"Well, good evening,\" said he, \"I'm going off to my elephant with my\nbrats. Supposing that you should need me some night, you can come and\nhunt me up there. I lodge on the entresol. There is no porter. You will\ninquire for Monsieur Gavroche.\"\n\n\"Very good,\" said Montparnasse.\n\nAnd they parted, Montparnasse betaking himself in the direction of\nthe Greve, and Gavroche towards the Bastille. The little one of five,\ndragged along by his brother who was dragged by Gavroche, turned his\nhead back several times to watch \"Porrichinelle\" as he went.\n\nThe ambiguous phrase by means of which Montparnasse had warned Gavroche\nof the presence of the policeman, contained no other talisman than\nthe assonance dig repeated five or six times in different forms. This\nsyllable, dig, uttered alone or artistically mingled with the words of\na phrase, means: \"Take care, we can no longer talk freely.\" There was\nbesides, in Montparnasse's sentence, a literary beauty which was\nlost upon Gavroche, that is mon dogue, ma dague et ma digue, a slang\nexpression of the Temple, which signifies my dog, my knife, and my wife,\ngreatly in vogue among clowns and the red-tails in the great century\nwhen Moliere wrote and Callot drew.\n\nTwenty years ago, there was still to be seen in the southwest corner of\nthe Place de la Bastille, near the basin of the canal, excavated in the\nancient ditch of the fortress-prison, a singular monument, which has\nalready been effaced from the memories of Parisians, and which deserved\nto leave some trace, for it was the idea of a \"member of the Institute,\nthe General-in-chief of the army of Egypt.\"\n\nWe say monument, although it was only a rough model. But this model\nitself, a marvellous sketch, the grandiose skeleton of an idea of\nNapoleon's, which successive gusts of wind have carried away and thrown,\non each occasion, still further from us, had become historical and had\nacquired a certain definiteness which contrasted with its provisional\naspect. It was an elephant forty feet high, constructed of timber and\nmasonry, bearing on its back a tower which resembled a house, formerly\npainted green by some dauber, and now painted black by heaven, the wind,\nand time. In this deserted and unprotected corner of the place, the\nbroad brow of the colossus, his trunk, his tusks, his tower, his\nenormous crupper, his four feet, like columns produced, at night, under\nthe starry heavens, a surprising and terrible form. It was a sort of\nsymbol of popular force. It was sombre, mysterious, and immense. It was\nsome mighty, visible phantom, one knew not what, standing erect beside\nthe invisible spectre of the Bastille.\n\nFew strangers visited this edifice, no passer-by looked at it. It was\nfalling into ruins; every season the plaster which detached itself\nfrom its sides formed hideous wounds upon it. \"The aediles,\" as the\nexpression ran in elegant dialect, had forgotten it ever since 1814.\nThere it stood in its corner, melancholy, sick, crumbling, surrounded\nby a rotten palisade, soiled continually by drunken coachmen; cracks\nmeandered athwart its belly, a lath projected from its tail, tall grass\nflourished between its legs; and, as the level of the place had been\nrising all around it for a space of thirty years, by that slow and\ncontinuous movement which insensibly elevates the soil of large towns,\nit stood in a hollow, and it looked as though the ground were giving way\nbeneath it. It was unclean, despised, repulsive, and superb, ugly in the\neyes of the bourgeois, melancholy in the eyes of the thinker. There was\nsomething about it of the dirt which is on the point of being swept out,\nand something of the majesty which is on the point of being decapitated.\nAs we have said, at night, its aspect changed. Night is the real element\nof everything that is dark. As soon as twilight descended, the old\nelephant became transfigured; he assumed a tranquil and redoubtable\nappearance in the formidable serenity of the shadows. Being of the past,\nhe belonged to night; and obscurity was in keeping with his grandeur.\n\nThis rough, squat, heavy, hard, austere, almost misshapen, but assuredly\nmajestic monument, stamped with a sort of magnificent and savage\ngravity, has disappeared, and left to reign in peace, a sort of gigantic\nstove, ornamented with its pipe, which has replaced the sombre fortress\nwith its nine towers, very much as the bourgeoisie replaces the feudal\nclasses. It is quite natural that a stove should be the symbol of an\nepoch in which a pot contains power. This epoch will pass away, people\nhave already begun to understand that, if there can be force in a\nboiler, there can be no force except in the brain; in other words,\nthat which leads and drags on the world, is not locomotives, but ideas.\nHarness locomotives to ideas,--that is well done; but do not mistake the\nhorse for the rider.\n\nAt all events, to return to the Place de la Bastille, the architect\nof this elephant succeeded in making a grand thing out of plaster; the\narchitect of the stove has succeeded in making a pretty thing out of\nbronze.\n\nThis stove-pipe, which has been baptized by a sonorous name, and called\nthe column of July, this monument of a revolution that miscarried,\nwas still enveloped in 1832, in an immense shirt of woodwork, which we\nregret, for our part, and by a vast plank enclosure, which completed the\ntask of isolating the elephant.\n\nIt was towards this corner of the place, dimly lighted by the reflection\nof a distant street lamp, that the gamin guided his two \"brats.\"\n\nThe reader must permit us to interrupt ourselves here and to remind him\nthat we are dealing with simple reality, and that twenty years ago, the\ntribunals were called upon to judge, under the charge of vagabondage,\nand mutilation of a public monument, a child who had been caught asleep\nin this very elephant of the Bastille. This fact noted, we proceed.\n\nOn arriving in the vicinity of the colossus, Gavroche comprehended the\neffect which the infinitely great might produce on the infinitely small,\nand said:--\n\n\"Don't be scared, infants.\"\n\nThen he entered through a gap in the fence into the elephant's enclosure\nand helped the young ones to clamber through the breach. The two\nchildren, somewhat frightened, followed Gavroche without uttering a\nword, and confided themselves to this little Providence in rags which\nhad given them bread and had promised them a shelter.\n\nThere, extended along the fence, lay a ladder which by day served\nthe laborers in the neighboring timber-yard. Gavroche raised it with\nremarkable vigor, and placed it against one of the elephant's forelegs.\nNear the point where the ladder ended, a sort of black hole in the belly\nof the colossus could be distinguished.\n\nGavroche pointed out the ladder and the hole to his guests, and said to\nthem:--\n\n\"Climb up and go in.\"\n\nThe two little boys exchanged terrified glances.\n\n\"You're afraid, brats!\" exclaimed Gavroche.\n\nAnd he added:--\n\n\"You shall see!\"\n\nHe clasped the rough leg of the elephant, and in a twinkling, without\ndeigning to make use of the ladder, he had reached the aperture. He\nentered it as an adder slips through a crevice, and disappeared within,\nand an instant later, the two children saw his head, which looked pale,\nappear vaguely, on the edge of the shadowy hole, like a wan and whitish\nspectre.\n\n\"Well!\" he exclaimed, \"climb up, young 'uns! You'll see how snug it is\nhere! Come up, you!\" he said to the elder, \"I'll lend you a hand.\"\n\nThe little fellows nudged each other, the gamin frightened and inspired\nthem with confidence at one and the same time, and then, it was raining\nvery hard. The elder one undertook the risk. The younger, on seeing his\nbrother climbing up, and himself left alone between the paws of this\nhuge beast, felt greatly inclined to cry, but he did not dare.\n\nThe elder lad climbed, with uncertain steps, up the rungs of the ladder;\nGavroche, in the meanwhile, encouraging him with exclamations like a\nfencing-master to his pupils, or a muleteer to his mules.\n\n\"Don't be afraid!--That's it!--Come on!--Put your feet there!--Give us\nyour hand here!--Boldly!\"\n\nAnd when the child was within reach, he seized him suddenly and\nvigorously by the arm, and pulled him towards him.\n\n\"Nabbed!\" said he.\n\nThe brat had passed through the crack.\n\n\"Now,\" said Gavroche, \"wait for me. Be so good as to take a seat,\nMonsieur.\"\n\nAnd making his way out of the hole as he had entered it, he slipped down\nthe elephant's leg with the agility of a monkey, landed on his feet in\nthe grass, grasped the child of five round the body, and planted him\nfairly in the middle of the ladder, then he began to climb up behind\nhim, shouting to the elder:--\n\n\"I'm going to boost him, do you tug.\"\n\nAnd in another instant, the small lad was pushed, dragged, pulled,\nthrust, stuffed into the hole, before he had time to recover himself,\nand Gavroche, entering behind him, and repulsing the ladder with a kick\nwhich sent it flat on the grass, began to clap his hands and to cry:--\n\n\"Here we are! Long live General Lafayette!\"\n\nThis explosion over, he added:--\n\n\"Now, young 'uns, you are in my house.\"\n\nGavroche was at home, in fact.\n\nOh, unforeseen utility of the useless! Charity of great things! Goodness\nof giants! This huge monument, which had embodied an idea of the\nEmperor's, had become the box of a street urchin. The brat had been\naccepted and sheltered by the colossus. The bourgeois decked out in\ntheir Sunday finery who passed the elephant of the Bastille, were fond\nof saying as they scanned it disdainfully with their prominent eyes:\n\"What's the good of that?\" It served to save from the cold, the frost,\nthe hail, and rain, to shelter from the winds of winter, to preserve\nfrom slumber in the mud which produces fever, and from slumber in the\nsnow which produces death, a little being who had no father, no mother,\nno bread, no clothes, no refuge. It served to receive the innocent whom\nsociety repulsed. It served to diminish public crime. It was a lair\nopen to one against whom all doors were shut. It seemed as though the\nmiserable old mastodon, invaded by vermin and oblivion, covered with\nwarts, with mould, and ulcers, tottering, worm-eaten, abandoned,\ncondemned, a sort of mendicant colossus, asking alms in vain with a\nbenevolent look in the midst of the cross-roads, had taken pity on that\nother mendicant, the poor pygmy, who roamed without shoes to his feet,\nwithout a roof over his head, blowing on his fingers, clad in rags, fed\non rejected scraps. That was what the elephant of the Bastille was good\nfor. This idea of Napoleon, disdained by men, had been taken back by\nGod. That which had been merely illustrious, had become august. In order\nto realize his thought, the Emperor should have had porphyry, brass,\niron, gold, marble; the old collection of planks, beams and plaster\nsufficed for God. The Emperor had had the dream of a genius; in that\nTitanic elephant, armed, prodigious, with trunk uplifted, bearing its\ntower and scattering on all sides its merry and vivifying waters, he\nwished to incarnate the people. God had done a grander thing with it, he\nhad lodged a child there.\n\nThe hole through which Gavroche had entered was a breach which was\nhardly visible from the outside, being concealed, as we have stated,\nbeneath the elephant's belly, and so narrow that it was only cats and\nhomeless children who could pass through it.\n\n\"Let's begin,\" said Gavroche, \"by telling the porter that we are not at\nhome.\"\n\nAnd plunging into the darkness with the assurance of a person who is\nwell acquainted with his apartments, he took a plank and stopped up the\naperture.\n\nAgain Gavroche plunged into the obscurity. The children heard the\ncrackling of the match thrust into the phosphoric bottle. The chemical\nmatch was not yet in existence; at that epoch the Fumade steel\nrepresented progress.\n\nA sudden light made them blink; Gavroche had just managed to ignite one\nof those bits of cord dipped in resin which are called cellar rats. The\ncellar rat, which emitted more smoke than light, rendered the interior\nof the elephant confusedly visible.\n\nGavroche's two guests glanced about them, and the sensation which they\nexperienced was something like that which one would feel if shut up in\nthe great tun of Heidelberg, or, better still, like what Jonah must have\nfelt in the biblical belly of the whale. An entire and gigantic skeleton\nappeared enveloping them. Above, a long brown beam, whence started at\nregular distances, massive, arching ribs, represented the vertebral\ncolumn with its sides, stalactites of plaster depended from them like\nentrails, and vast spiders' webs stretching from side to side, formed\ndirty diaphragms. Here and there, in the corners, were visible large\nblackish spots which had the appearance of being alive, and which\nchanged places rapidly with an abrupt and frightened movement.\n\nFragments which had fallen from the elephant's back into his belly had\nfilled up the cavity, so that it was possible to walk upon it as on a\nfloor.\n\nThe smaller child nestled up against his brother, and whispered to\nhim:--\n\n\"It's black.\"\n\nThis remark drew an exclamation from Gavroche. The petrified air of the\ntwo brats rendered some shock necessary.\n\n\"What's that you are gabbling about there?\" he exclaimed. \"Are\nyou scoffing at me? Are you turning up your noses? Do you want the\ntuileries? Are you brutes? Come, say! I warn you that I don't belong to\nthe regiment of simpletons. Ah, come now, are you brats from the Pope's\nestablishment?\"\n\nA little roughness is good in cases of fear. It is reassuring. The two\nchildren drew close to Gavroche.\n\nGavroche, paternally touched by this confidence, passed from grave to\ngentle, and addressing the smaller:--\n\n\"Stupid,\" said he, accenting the insulting word, with a caressing\nintonation, \"it's outside that it is black. Outside it's raining, here\nit does not rain; outside it's cold, here there's not an atom of wind;\noutside there are heaps of people, here there's no one; outside there\nain't even the moon, here there's my candle, confound it!\"\n\nThe two children began to look upon the apartment with less terror; but\nGavroche allowed them no more time for contemplation.\n\n\"Quick,\" said he.\n\nAnd he pushed them towards what we are very glad to be able to call the\nend of the room.\n\nThere stood his bed.\n\nGavroche's bed was complete; that is to say, it had a mattress, a\nblanket, and an alcove with curtains.\n\nThe mattress was a straw mat, the blanket a rather large strip of\ngray woollen stuff, very warm and almost new. This is what the alcove\nconsisted of:--\n\nThree rather long poles, thrust into and consolidated, with the rubbish\nwhich formed the floor, that is to say, the belly of the elephant, two\nin front and one behind, and united by a rope at their summits, so as to\nform a pyramidal bundle. This cluster supported a trellis-work of brass\nwire which was simply placed upon it, but artistically applied, and held\nby fastenings of iron wire, so that it enveloped all three holes. A row\nof very heavy stones kept this network down to the floor so that nothing\ncould pass under it. This grating was nothing else than a piece of the\nbrass screens with which aviaries are covered in menageries. Gavroche's\nbed stood as in a cage, behind this net. The whole resembled an\nEsquimaux tent.\n\nThis trellis-work took the place of curtains.\n\nGavroche moved aside the stones which fastened the net down in front,\nand the two folds of the net which lapped over each other fell apart.\n\n\"Down on all fours, brats!\" said Gavroche.\n\nHe made his guests enter the cage with great precaution, then he crawled\nin after them, pulled the stones together, and closed the opening\nhermetically again.\n\nAll three had stretched out on the mat. Gavroche still had the cellar\nrat in his hand.\n\n\"Now,\" said he, \"go to sleep! I'm going to suppress the candelabra.\"\n\n\"Monsieur,\" the elder of the brothers asked Gavroche, pointing to the\nnetting, \"what's that for?\"\n\n\"That,\" answered Gavroche gravely, \"is for the rats. Go to sleep!\"\n\nNevertheless, he felt obliged to add a few words of instruction for the\nbenefit of these young creatures, and he continued:--\n\n\"It's a thing from the Jardin des Plantes. It's used for fierce animals.\nThere's a whole shopful of them there. All you've got to do is to climb\nover a wall, crawl through a window, and pass through a door. You can\nget as much as you want.\"\n\nAs he spoke, he wrapped the younger one up bodily in a fold of the\nblanket, and the little one murmured:--\n\n\"Oh! how good that is! It's warm!\"\n\nGavroche cast a pleased eye on the blanket.\n\n\"That's from the Jardin des Plantes, too,\" said he. \"I took that from\nthe monkeys.\"\n\nAnd, pointing out to the eldest the mat on which he was lying, a very\nthick and admirably made mat, he added:--\n\n\"That belonged to the giraffe.\"\n\nAfter a pause he went on:--\n\n\"The beasts had all these things. I took them away from them. It didn't\ntrouble them. I told them: 'It's for the elephant.'\"\n\nHe paused, and then resumed:--\n\n\"You crawl over the walls and you don't care a straw for the government.\nSo there now!\"\n\nThe two children gazed with timid and stupefied respect on this\nintrepid and ingenious being, a vagabond like themselves, isolated\nlike themselves, frail like themselves, who had something admirable\nand all-powerful about him, who seemed supernatural to them, and whose\nphysiognomy was composed of all the grimaces of an old mountebank,\nmingled with the most ingenuous and charming smiles.\n\n\"Monsieur,\" ventured the elder timidly, \"you are not afraid of the\npolice, then?\"\n\nGavroche contented himself with replying:--\n\n\"Brat! Nobody says 'police,' they say 'bobbies.'\"\n\nThe smaller had his eyes wide open, but he said nothing. As he was on\nthe edge of the mat, the elder being in the middle, Gavroche tucked the\nblanket round him as a mother might have done, and heightened the mat\nunder his head with old rags, in such a way as to form a pillow for the\nchild. Then he turned to the elder:--\n\n\"Hey! We're jolly comfortable here, ain't we?\"\n\n\"Ah, yes!\" replied the elder, gazing at Gavroche with the expression of\na saved angel.\n\nThe two poor little children who had been soaked through, began to grow\nwarm once more.\n\n\"Ah, by the way,\" continued Gavroche, \"what were you bawling about?\"\n\nAnd pointing out the little one to his brother:--\n\n\"A mite like that, I've nothing to say about, but the idea of a big\nfellow like you crying! It's idiotic; you looked like a calf.\"\n\n\"Gracious,\" replied the child, \"we have no lodging.\"\n\n\"Bother!\" retorted Gavroche, \"you don't say 'lodgings,' you say 'crib.'\"\n\n\"And then, we were afraid of being alone like that at night.\"\n\n\"You don't say 'night,' you say 'darkmans.'\"\n\n\"Thank you, sir,\" said the child.\n\n\"Listen,\" went on Gavroche, \"you must never bawl again over anything.\nI'll take care of you. You shall see what fun we'll have. In summer,\nwe'll go to the Glaciere with Navet, one of my pals, we'll bathe in\nthe Gare, we'll run stark naked in front of the rafts on the bridge at\nAusterlitz,--that makes the laundresses raging. They scream, they get\nmad, and if you only knew how ridiculous they are! We'll go and see the\nman-skeleton. And then I'll take you to the play. I'll take you to see\nFrederick Lemaitre. I have tickets, I know some of the actors, I even\nplayed in a piece once. There were a lot of us fellers, and we ran\nunder a cloth, and that made the sea. I'll get you an engagement at my\ntheatre. We'll go to see the savages. They ain't real, those savages\nain't. They wear pink tights that go all in wrinkles, and you can see\nwhere their elbows have been darned with white. Then, we'll go to the\nOpera. We'll get in with the hired applauders. The Opera claque is well\nmanaged. I wouldn't associate with the claque on the boulevard. At the\nOpera, just fancy! some of them pay twenty sous, but they're ninnies.\nThey're called dishclouts. And then we'll go to see the guillotine work.\nI'll show you the executioner. He lives in the Rue des Marais. Monsieur\nSanson. He has a letter-box at his door. Ah! we'll have famous fun!\"\n\nAt that moment a drop of wax fell on Gavroche's finger, and recalled him\nto the realities of life.\n\n\"The deuce!\" said he, \"there's the wick giving out. Attention! I can't\nspend more than a sou a month on my lighting. When a body goes to bed,\nhe must sleep. We haven't the time to read M. Paul de Kock's\nromances. And besides, the light might pass through the cracks of the\nporte-cochere, and all the bobbies need to do is to see it.\"\n\n\"And then,\" remarked the elder timidly,--he alone dared talk to\nGavroche, and reply to him, \"a spark might fall in the straw, and we\nmust look out and not burn the house down.\"\n\n\"People don't say 'burn the house down,'\" remarked Gavroche, \"they say\n'blaze the crib.'\"\n\nThe storm increased in violence, and the heavy downpour beat upon the\nback of the colossus amid claps of thunder. \"You're taken in, rain!\"\nsaid Gavroche. \"It amuses me to hear the decanter run down the legs of\nthe house. Winter is a stupid; it wastes its merchandise, it loses\nits labor, it can't wet us, and that makes it kick up a row, old\nwater-carrier that it is.\"\n\nThis allusion to the thunder, all the consequences of which Gavroche, in\nhis character of a philosopher of the nineteenth century, accepted, was\nfollowed by a broad flash of lightning, so dazzling that a hint of it\nentered the belly of the elephant through the crack. Almost at the same\ninstant, the thunder rumbled with great fury. The two little creatures\nuttered a shriek, and started up so eagerly that the network came near\nbeing displaced, but Gavroche turned his bold face to them, and took\nadvantage of the clap of thunder to burst into a laugh.\n\n\"Calm down, children. Don't topple over the edifice. That's fine,\nfirst-class thunder; all right. That's no slouch of a streak of\nlightning. Bravo for the good God! Deuce take it! It's almost as good as\nit is at the Ambigu.\"\n\nThat said, he restored order in the netting, pushed the two children\ngently down on the bed, pressed their knees, in order to stretch them\nout at full length, and exclaimed:--\n\n\"Since the good God is lighting his candle, I can blow out mine. Now,\nbabes, now, my young humans, you must shut your peepers. It's very bad\nnot to sleep. It'll make you swallow the strainer, or, as they say, in\nfashionable society, stink in the gullet. Wrap yourself up well in the\nhide! I'm going to put out the light. Are you ready?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" murmured the elder, \"I'm all right. I seem to have feathers under\nmy head.\"\n\n\"People don't say 'head,'\" cried Gavroche, \"they say 'nut'.\"\n\nThe two children nestled close to each other, Gavroche finished\narranging them on the mat, drew the blanket up to their very ears, then\nrepeated, for the third time, his injunction in the hieratical tongue:--\n\n\"Shut your peepers!\"\n\nAnd he snuffed out his tiny light.\n\nHardly had the light been extinguished, when a peculiar trembling began\nto affect the netting under which the three children lay.\n\nIt consisted of a multitude of dull scratches which produced a metallic\nsound, as if claws and teeth were gnawing at the copper wire. This was\naccompanied by all sorts of little piercing cries.\n\nThe little five-year-old boy, on hearing this hubbub overhead, and\nchilled with terror, jogged his brother's elbow; but the elder brother\nhad already shut his peepers, as Gavroche had ordered. Then the little\none, who could no longer control his terror, questioned Gavroche, but in\na very low tone, and with bated breath:--\n\n\"Sir?\"\n\n\"Hey?\" said Gavroche, who had just closed his eyes.\n\n\"What is that?\"\n\n\"It's the rats,\" replied Gavroche.\n\nAnd he laid his head down on the mat again.\n\nThe rats, in fact, who swarmed by thousands in the carcass of the\nelephant, and who were the living black spots which we have already\nmentioned, had been held in awe by the flame of the candle, so long as\nit had been lighted; but as soon as the cavern, which was the same\nas their city, had returned to darkness, scenting what the good\nstory-teller Perrault calls \"fresh meat,\" they had hurled themselves in\nthrongs on Gavroche's tent, had climbed to the top of it, and had begun\nto bite the meshes as though seeking to pierce this new-fangled trap.\n\nStill the little one could not sleep.\n\n\"Sir?\" he began again.\n\n\"Hey?\" said Gavroche.\n\n\"What are rats?\"\n\n\"They are mice.\"\n\nThis explanation reassured the child a little. He had seen white mice in\nthe course of his life, and he was not afraid of them. Nevertheless, he\nlifted up his voice once more.\n\n\"Sir?\"\n\n\"Hey?\" said Gavroche again.\n\n\"Why don't you have a cat?\"\n\n\"I did have one,\" replied Gavroche, \"I brought one here, but they ate\nher.\"\n\nThis second explanation undid the work of the first, and the little\nfellow began to tremble again.\n\nThe dialogue between him and Gavroche began again for the fourth time:--\n\n\"Monsieur?\"\n\n\"Hey?\"\n\n\"Who was it that was eaten?\"\n\n\"The cat.\"\n\n\"And who ate the cat?\"\n\n\"The rats.\"\n\n\"The mice?\"\n\n\"Yes, the rats.\"\n\nThe child, in consternation, dismayed at the thought of mice which ate\ncats, pursued:--\n\n\"Sir, would those mice eat us?\"\n\n\"Wouldn't they just!\" ejaculated Gavroche.\n\nThe child's terror had reached its climax. But Gavroche added:--\n\n\"Don't be afraid. They can't get in. And besides, I'm here! Here, catch\nhold of my hand. Hold your tongue and shut your peepers!\"\n\nAt the same time Gavroche grasped the little fellow's hand across his\nbrother. The child pressed the hand close to him, and felt reassured.\nCourage and strength have these mysterious ways of communicating\nthemselves. Silence reigned round them once more, the sound of their\nvoices had frightened off the rats; at the expiration of a few minutes,\nthey came raging back, but in vain, the three little fellows were fast\nasleep and heard nothing more.\n\nThe hours of the night fled away. Darkness covered the vast Place de la\nBastille. A wintry gale, which mingled with the rain, blew in gusts, the\npatrol searched all the doorways, alleys, enclosures, and obscure nooks,\nand in their search for nocturnal vagabonds they passed in silence\nbefore the elephant; the monster, erect, motionless, staring open-eyed\ninto the shadows, had the appearance of dreaming happily over his good\ndeed; and sheltered from heaven and from men the three poor sleeping\nchildren.\n\nIn order to understand what is about to follow, the reader must\nremember, that, at that epoch, the Bastille guard-house was situated at\nthe other end of the square, and that what took place in the vicinity of\nthe elephant could neither be seen nor heard by the sentinel.\n\nTowards the end of that hour which immediately precedes the dawn, a\nman turned from the Rue Saint-Antoine at a run, made the circuit of the\nenclosure of the column of July, and glided between the palings until he\nwas underneath the belly of the elephant. If any light had illuminated\nthat man, it might have been divined from the thorough manner in which\nhe was soaked that he had passed the night in the rain. Arrived beneath\nthe elephant, he uttered a peculiar cry, which did not belong to any\nhuman tongue, and which a paroquet alone could have imitated. Twice he\nrepeated this cry, of whose orthography the following barely conveys an\nidea:--\n\n\"Kirikikiou!\"\n\nAt the second cry, a clear, young, merry voice responded from the belly\nof the elephant:--\n\n\"Yes!\"\n\nAlmost immediately, the plank which closed the hole was drawn aside,\nand gave passage to a child who descended the elephant's leg, and fell\nbriskly near the man. It was Gavroche. The man was Montparnasse.\n\nAs for his cry of Kirikikiou,--that was, doubtless, what the child had\nmeant, when he said:--\n\n\"You will ask for Monsieur Gavroche.\"\n\nOn hearing it, he had waked with a start, had crawled out of his\n\"alcove,\" pushing apart the netting a little, and carefully drawing it\ntogether again, then he had opened the trap, and descended.\n\nThe man and the child recognized each other silently amid the gloom:\nMontparnasse confined himself to the remark:--\n\n\"We need you. Come, lend us a hand.\"\n\nThe lad asked for no further enlightenment.\n\n\"I'm with you,\" said he.\n\nAnd both took their way towards the Rue Saint-Antoine, whence\nMontparnasse had emerged, winding rapidly through the long file of\nmarket-gardeners' carts which descend towards the markets at that hour.\n\nThe market-gardeners, crouching, half-asleep, in their wagons, amid the\nsalads and vegetables, enveloped to their very eyes in their mufflers\non account of the beating rain, did not even glance at these strange\npedestrians.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III--THE VICISSITUDES OF FLIGHT\n\nThis is what had taken place that same night at the La Force:--\n\nAn escape had been planned between Babet, Brujon, Guelemer, and\nThenardier, although Thenardier was in close confinement. Babet had\narranged the matter for his own benefit, on the same day, as the reader\nhas seen from Montparnasse's account to Gavroche. Montparnasse was to\nhelp them from outside.\n\nBrujon, after having passed a month in the punishment cell, had had\ntime, in the first place, to weave a rope, in the second, to mature a\nplan. In former times, those severe places where the discipline of the\nprison delivers the convict into his own hands, were composed of four\nstone walls, a stone ceiling, a flagged pavement, a camp bed, a grated\nwindow, and a door lined with iron, and were called dungeons; but the\ndungeon was judged to be too terrible; nowadays they are composed of an\niron door, a grated window, a camp bed, a flagged pavement, four stone\nwalls, and a stone ceiling, and are called chambers of punishment. A\nlittle light penetrates towards mid-day. The inconvenient point about\nthese chambers which, as the reader sees, are not dungeons, is that they\nallow the persons who should be at work to think.\n\nSo Brujon meditated, and he emerged from the chamber of punishment with\na rope. As he had the name of being very dangerous in the Charlemagne\ncourtyard, he was placed in the New Building. The first thing he found\nin the New Building was Guelemer, the second was a nail; Guelemer, that\nis to say, crime; a nail, that is to say, liberty. Brujon, of whom it\nis high time that the reader should have a complete idea, was, with an\nappearance of delicate health and a profoundly premeditated languor, a\npolished, intelligent sprig, and a thief, who had a caressing glance,\nand an atrocious smile. His glance resulted from his will, and his\nsmile from his nature. His first studies in his art had been directed\nto roofs. He had made great progress in the industry of the men who tear\noff lead, who plunder the roofs and despoil the gutters by the process\ncalled double pickings.\n\nThe circumstance which put the finishing touch on the moment peculiarly\nfavorable for an attempt at escape, was that the roofers were re-laying\nand re-jointing, at that very moment, a portion of the slates on the\nprison. The Saint-Bernard courtyard was no longer absolutely isolated\nfrom the Charlemagne and the Saint-Louis courts. Up above there were\nscaffoldings and ladders; in other words, bridges and stairs in the\ndirection of liberty.\n\nThe New Building, which was the most cracked and decrepit thing to be\nseen anywhere in the world, was the weak point in the prison. The walls\nwere eaten by saltpetre to such an extent that the authorities had been\nobliged to line the vaults of the dormitories with a sheathing of wood,\nbecause stones were in the habit of becoming detached and falling on\nthe prisoners in their beds. In spite of this antiquity, the authorities\ncommitted the error of confining in the New Building the most\ntroublesome prisoners, of placing there \"the hard cases,\" as they say in\nprison parlance.\n\nThe New Building contained four dormitories, one above the other, and a\ntop story which was called the Bel-Air (Fine Air). A large chimney-flue,\nprobably from some ancient kitchen of the Dukes de la Force, started\nfrom the groundfloor, traversed all four stories, cut the dormitories,\nwhere it figured as a flattened pillar, into two portions, and finally\npierced the roof.\n\nGuelemer and Brujon were in the same dormitory. They had been placed, by\nway of precaution, on the lower story. Chance ordained that the heads of\ntheir beds should rest against the chimney.\n\nThenardier was directly over their heads in the top story known as\nFine-Air. The pedestrian who halts on the Rue Culture-Sainte-Catherine,\nafter passing the barracks of the firemen, in front of the porte-cochere\nof the bathing establishment, beholds a yard full of flowers and shrubs\nin wooden boxes, at the extremity of which spreads out a little white\nrotunda with two wings, brightened up with green shutters, the bucolic\ndream of Jean Jacques.\n\nNot more than ten years ago, there rose above that rotunda an enormous\nblack, hideous, bare wall by which it was backed up.\n\nThis was the outer wall of La Force.\n\nThis wall, beside that rotunda, was Milton viewed through Berquin.\n\nLofty as it was, this wall was overtopped by a still blacker roof, which\ncould be seen beyond. This was the roof of the New Building. There\none could descry four dormer-windows, guarded with bars; they were the\nwindows of the Fine-Air.\n\nA chimney pierced the roof; this was the chimney which traversed the\ndormitories.\n\nThe Bel-Air, that top story of the New Building, was a sort of large\nhall, with a Mansard roof, guarded with triple gratings and double doors\nof sheet iron, which were studded with enormous bolts. When one entered\nfrom the north end, one had on one's left the four dormer-windows, on\none's right, facing the windows, at regular intervals, four square,\ntolerably vast cages, separated by narrow passages, built of masonry\nto about the height of the elbow, and the rest, up to the roof, of iron\nbars.\n\nThenardier had been in solitary confinement in one of these cages since\nthe night of the 3d of February. No one was ever able to discover how,\nand by what connivance, he succeeded in procuring, and secreting a\nbottle of wine, invented, so it is said, by Desrues, with which\na narcotic is mixed, and which the band of the Endormeurs, or\nSleep-compellers, rendered famous.\n\nThere are, in many prisons, treacherous employees, half-jailers,\nhalf-thieves, who assist in escapes, who sell to the police an\nunfaithful service, and who turn a penny whenever they can.\n\nOn that same night, then, when Little Gavroche picked up the two lost\nchildren, Brujon and Guelemer, who knew that Babet, who had escaped that\nmorning, was waiting for them in the street as well as Montparnasse,\nrose softly, and with the nail which Brujon had found, began to pierce\nthe chimney against which their beds stood. The rubbish fell on Brujon's\nbed, so that they were not heard. Showers mingled with thunder shook\nthe doors on their hinges, and created in the prison a terrible and\nopportune uproar. Those of the prisoners who woke, pretended to fall\nasleep again, and left Guelemer and Brujon to their own devices. Brujon\nwas adroit; Guelemer was vigorous. Before any sound had reached the\nwatcher, who was sleeping in the grated cell which opened into the\ndormitory, the wall had, been pierced, the chimney scaled, the iron\ngrating which barred the upper orifice of the flue forced, and the two\nredoubtable ruffians were on the roof. The wind and rain redoubled, the\nroof was slippery.\n\n\"What a good night to leg it!\" said Brujon.\n\nAn abyss six feet broad and eighty feet deep separated them from the\nsurrounding wall. At the bottom of this abyss, they could see the musket\nof a sentinel gleaming through the gloom. They fastened one end of the\nrope which Brujon had spun in his dungeon to the stumps of the iron bars\nwhich they had just wrenched off, flung the other over the outer wall,\ncrossed the abyss at one bound, clung to the coping of the wall, got\nastride of it, let themselves slip, one after the other, along the rope,\nupon a little roof which touches the bath-house, pulled their rope after\nthem, jumped down into the courtyard of the bath-house, traversed it,\npushed open the porter's wicket, beside which hung his rope, pulled\nthis, opened the porte-cochere, and found themselves in the street.\n\nThree-quarters of an hour had not elapsed since they had risen in bed in\nthe dark, nail in hand, and their project in their heads.\n\nA few moments later they had joined Babet and Montparnasse, who were\nprowling about the neighborhood.\n\nThey had broken their rope in pulling it after them, and a bit of it\nremained attached to the chimney on the roof. They had sustained no\nother damage, however, than that of scratching nearly all the skin off\ntheir hands.\n\nThat night, Thenardier was warned, without any one being able to explain\nhow, and was not asleep.\n\nTowards one o'clock in the morning, the night being very dark, he saw\ntwo shadows pass along the roof, in the rain and squalls, in front of\nthe dormer-window which was opposite his cage. One halted at the window,\nlong enough to dart in a glance. This was Brujon.\n\nThenardier recognized him, and understood. This was enough.\n\nThenardier, rated as a burglar, and detained as a measure of precaution\nunder the charge of organizing a nocturnal ambush, with armed force, was\nkept in sight. The sentry, who was relieved every two hours, marched\nup and down in front of his cage with loaded musket. The Fine-Air was\nlighted by a skylight. The prisoner had on his feet fetters weighing\nfifty pounds. Every day, at four o'clock in the afternoon, a jailer,\nescorted by two dogs,--this was still in vogue at that time,--entered\nhis cage, deposited beside his bed a loaf of black bread weighing two\npounds, a jug of water, a bowl filled with rather thin bouillon, in\nwhich swam a few Mayagan beans, inspected his irons and tapped the bars.\nThis man and his dogs made two visits during the night.\n\nThenardier had obtained permission to keep a sort of iron bolt which he\nused to spike his bread into a crack in the wall, \"in order to preserve\nit from the rats,\" as he said. As Thenardier was kept in sight,\nno objection had been made to this spike. Still, it was remembered\nafterwards, that one of the jailers had said: \"It would be better to let\nhim have only a wooden spike.\"\n\nAt two o'clock in the morning, the sentinel, who was an old soldier, was\nrelieved, and replaced by a conscript. A few moments later, the man with\nthe dogs paid his visit, and went off without noticing anything, except,\npossibly, the excessive youth and \"the rustic air\" of the \"raw recruit.\"\nTwo hours afterwards, at four o'clock, when they came to relieve the\nconscript, he was found asleep on the floor, lying like a log near\nThenardier's cage. As for Thenardier, he was no longer there. There was\na hole in the ceiling of his cage, and, above it, another hole in the\nroof. One of the planks of his bed had been wrenched off, and probably\ncarried away with him, as it was not found. They also seized in his cell\na half-empty bottle which contained the remains of the stupefying wine\nwith which the soldier had been drugged. The soldier's bayonet had\ndisappeared.\n\nAt the moment when this discovery was made, it was assumed that\nThenardier was out of reach. The truth is, that he was no longer in the\nNew Building, but that he was still in great danger.\n\nThenardier, on reaching the roof of the New Building, had found the\nremains of Brujon's rope hanging to the bars of the upper trap of the\nchimney, but, as this broken fragment was much too short, he had not\nbeen able to escape by the outer wall, as Brujon and Guelemer had done.\n\nWhen one turns from the Rue des Ballets into the Rue du Roi-de-Sicile,\none almost immediately encounters a repulsive ruin. There stood on\nthat spot, in the last century, a house of which only the back wall now\nremains, a regular wall of masonry, which rises to the height of the\nthird story between the adjoining buildings. This ruin can be recognized\nby two large square windows which are still to be seen there; the middle\none, that nearest the right gable, is barred with a worm-eaten beam\nadjusted like a prop. Through these windows there was formerly visible a\nlofty and lugubrious wall, which was a fragment of the outer wall of La\nForce.\n\nThe empty space on the street left by the demolished house is\nhalf-filled by a fence of rotten boards, shored up by five stone posts.\nIn this recess lies concealed a little shanty which leans against the\nportion of the ruin which has remained standing. The fence has a gate,\nwhich, a few years ago, was fastened only by a latch.\n\nIt was the crest of this ruin that Thenardier had succeeded in reaching,\na little after one o'clock in the morning.\n\nHow had he got there? That is what no one has ever been able to explain\nor understand. The lightning must, at the same time, have hindered\nand helped him. Had he made use of the ladders and scaffoldings of the\nslaters to get from roof to roof, from enclosure to enclosure, from\ncompartment to compartment, to the buildings of the Charlemagne court,\nthen to the buildings of the Saint-Louis court, to the outer wall, and\nthence to the hut on the Rue du Roi-de-Sicile? But in that itinerary\nthere existed breaks which seemed to render it an impossibility. Had\nhe placed the plank from his bed like a bridge from the roof of the\nFine-Air to the outer wall, and crawled flat, on his belly on the coping\nof the outer wall the whole distance round the prison as far as the hut?\nBut the outer wall of La Force formed a crenellated and unequal line;\nit mounted and descended, it dropped at the firemen's barracks, it rose\ntowards the bath-house, it was cut in twain by buildings, it was not\neven of the same height on the Hotel Lamoignon as on the Rue Pavee;\neverywhere occurred falls and right angles; and then, the sentinels must\nhave espied the dark form of the fugitive; hence, the route taken by\nThenardier still remains rather inexplicable. In two manners, flight was\nimpossible. Had Thenardier, spurred on by that thirst for liberty which\nchanges precipices into ditches, iron bars into wattles of osier, a\nlegless man into an athlete, a gouty man into a bird, stupidity into\ninstinct, instinct into intelligence, and intelligence into genius, had\nThenardier invented a third mode? No one has ever found out.\n\nThe marvels of escape cannot always be accounted for. The man who makes\nhis escape, we repeat, is inspired; there is something of the star and\nof the lightning in the mysterious gleam of flight; the effort towards\ndeliverance is no less surprising than the flight towards the sublime,\nand one says of the escaped thief: \"How did he contrive to scale that\nwall?\" in the same way that one says of Corneille: \"Where did he find\nthe means of dying?\"\n\nAt all events, dripping with perspiration, drenched with rain, with his\nclothes hanging in ribbons, his hands flayed, his elbows bleeding, his\nknees torn, Thenardier had reached what children, in their figurative\nlanguage, call the edge of the wall of the ruin, there he had stretched\nhimself out at full length, and there his strength had failed him. A\nsteep escarpment three stories high separated him from the pavement of\nthe street.\n\nThe rope which he had was too short.\n\nThere he waited, pale, exhausted, desperate with all the despair which\nhe had undergone, still hidden by the night, but telling himself that\nthe day was on the point of dawning, alarmed at the idea of hearing the\nneighboring clock of Saint-Paul strike four within a few minutes, an\nhour when the sentinel was relieved and when the latter would be found\nasleep under the pierced roof, staring in horror at a terrible depth, at\nthe light of the street lanterns, the wet, black pavement, that pavement\nlonged for yet frightful, which meant death, and which meant liberty.\n\nHe asked himself whether his three accomplices in flight had succeeded,\nif they had heard him, and if they would come to his assistance. He\nlistened. With the exception of the patrol, no one had passed through\nthe street since he had been there. Nearly the whole of the descent of\nthe market-gardeners from Montreuil, from Charonne, from Vincennes,\nand from Bercy to the markets was accomplished through the Rue\nSaint-Antoine.\n\nFour o'clock struck. Thenardier shuddered. A few moments later, that\nterrified and confused uproar which follows the discovery of an escape\nbroke forth in the prison. The sound of doors opening and shutting, the\ncreaking of gratings on their hinges, a tumult in the guard-house, the\nhoarse shouts of the turnkeys, the shock of musket-butts on the pavement\nof the courts, reached his ears. Lights ascended and descended past the\ngrated windows of the dormitories, a torch ran along the ridge-pole of\nthe top story of the New Building, the firemen belonging in the barracks\non the right had been summoned. Their helmets, which the torch lighted\nup in the rain, went and came along the roofs. At the same time,\nThenardier perceived in the direction of the Bastille a wan whiteness\nlighting up the edge of the sky in doleful wise.\n\nHe was on top of a wall ten inches wide, stretched out under the heavy\nrains, with two gulfs to right and left, unable to stir, subject to the\ngiddiness of a possible fall, and to the horror of a certain arrest,\nand his thoughts, like the pendulum of a clock, swung from one of these\nideas to the other: \"Dead if I fall, caught if I stay.\" In the midst of\nthis anguish, he suddenly saw, the street being still dark, a man who\nwas gliding along the walls and coming from the Rue Pavee, halt in the\nrecess above which Thenardier was, as it were, suspended. Here this\nman was joined by a second, who walked with the same caution, then by\na third, then by a fourth. When these men were re-united, one of them\nlifted the latch of the gate in the fence, and all four entered\nthe enclosure in which the shanty stood. They halted directly under\nThenardier. These men had evidently chosen this vacant space in order\nthat they might consult without being seen by the passers-by or by the\nsentinel who guards the wicket of La Force a few paces distant. It\nmust be added, that the rain kept this sentinel blocked in his box.\nThenardier, not being able to distinguish their visages, lent an ear to\ntheir words with the desperate attention of a wretch who feels himself\nlost.\n\nThenardier saw something resembling a gleam of hope flash before his\neyes,--these men conversed in slang.\n\nThe first said in a low but distinct voice:--\n\n\"Let's cut. What are we up to here?\"\n\nThe second replied: \"It's raining hard enough to put out the very\ndevil's fire. And the bobbies will be along instanter. There's a soldier\non guard yonder. We shall get nabbed here.\"\n\nThese two words, icigo and icicaille, both of which mean ici, and which\nbelong, the first to the slang of the barriers, the second to the slang\nof the Temple, were flashes of light for Thenardier. By the icigo he\nrecognized Brujon, who was a prowler of the barriers, by the icicaille\nhe knew Babet, who, among his other trades, had been an old-clothes\nbroker at the Temple.\n\nThe antique slang of the great century is no longer spoken except in\nthe Temple, and Babet was really the only person who spoke it in all\nits purity. Had it not been for the icicaille, Thenardier would not have\nrecognized him, for he had entirely changed his voice.\n\nIn the meanwhile, the third man had intervened.\n\n\"There's no hurry yet, let's wait a bit. How do we know that he doesn't\nstand in need of us?\"\n\nBy this, which was nothing but French, Thenardier recognized\nMontparnasse, who made it a point in his elegance to understand all\nslangs and to speak none of them.\n\nAs for the fourth, he held his peace, but his huge shoulders betrayed\nhim. Thenardier did not hesitate. It was Guelemer.\n\nBrujon replied almost impetuously but still in a low tone:--\n\n\"What are you jabbering about? The tavern-keeper hasn't managed to cut\nhis stick. He don't tumble to the racket, that he don't! You have to be\na pretty knowing cove to tear up your shirt, cut up your sheet to make\na rope, punch holes in doors, get up false papers, make false keys, file\nyour irons, hang out your cord, hide yourself, and disguise yourself!\nThe old fellow hasn't managed to play it, he doesn't understand how to\nwork the business.\"\n\nBabet added, still in that classical slang which was spoken by\nPoulailler and Cartouche, and which is to the bold, new, highly colored\nand risky argot used by Brujon what the language of Racine is to the\nlanguage of Andre Chenier:--\n\n\"Your tavern-keeper must have been nabbed in the act. You have to be\nknowing. He's only a greenhorn. He must have let himself be taken in\nby a bobby, perhaps even by a sheep who played it on him as his pal.\nListen, Montparnasse, do you hear those shouts in the prison? You have\nseen all those lights. He's recaptured, there! He'll get off with twenty\nyears. I ain't afraid, I ain't a coward, but there ain't anything more\nto do, or otherwise they'd lead us a dance. Don't get mad, come with us,\nlet's go drink a bottle of old wine together.\"\n\n\"One doesn't desert one's friends in a scrape,\" grumbled Montparnasse.\n\n\"I tell you he's nabbed!\" retorted Brujon. \"At the present moment, the\ninn-keeper ain't worth a ha'penny. We can't do nothing for him. Let's be\noff. Every minute I think a bobby has got me in his fist.\"\n\nMontparnasse no longer offered more than a feeble resistance; the fact\nis, that these four men, with the fidelity of ruffians who never abandon\neach other, had prowled all night long about La Force, great as was\ntheir peril, in the hope of seeing Thenardier make his appearance on the\ntop of some wall. But the night, which was really growing too fine,--for\nthe downpour was such as to render all the streets deserted,--the cold\nwhich was overpowering them, their soaked garments, their hole-ridden\nshoes, the alarming noise which had just burst forth in the prison, the\nhours which had elapsed, the patrol which they had encountered, the\nhope which was vanishing, all urged them to beat a retreat. Montparnasse\nhimself, who was, perhaps, almost Thenardier's son-in-law, yielded. A\nmoment more, and they would be gone. Thenardier was panting on his wall\nlike the shipwrecked sufferers of the Meduse on their raft when they\nbeheld the vessel which had appeared in sight vanish on the horizon.\n\nHe dared not call to them; a cry might be heard and ruin everything. An\nidea occurred to him, a last idea, a flash of inspiration; he drew from\nhis pocket the end of Brujon's rope, which he had detached from the\nchimney of the New Building, and flung it into the space enclosed by the\nfence.\n\nThis rope fell at their feet.\n\n\"A widow,\"[37] said Babet.\n\n\"My tortouse!\"[38] said Brujon.\n\n\"The tavern-keeper is there,\" said Montparnasse.\n\nThey raised their eyes. Thenardier thrust out his head a very little.\n\n\"Quick!\" said Montparnasse, \"have you the other end of the rope,\nBrujon?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Knot the two pieces together, we'll fling him the rope, he can fasten\nit to the wall, and he'll have enough of it to get down with.\"\n\nThenardier ran the risk, and spoke:--\n\n\"I am paralyzed with cold.\"\n\n\"We'll warm you up.\"\n\n\"I can't budge.\"\n\n\"Let yourself slide, we'll catch you.\"\n\n\"My hands are benumbed.\"\n\n\"Only fasten the rope to the wall.\"\n\n\"I can't.\"\n\n\"Then one of us must climb up,\" said Montparnasse.\n\n\"Three stories!\" ejaculated Brujon.\n\nAn ancient plaster flue, which had served for a stove that had been used\nin the shanty in former times, ran along the wall and mounted almost\nto the very spot where they could see Thenardier. This flue, then much\ndamaged and full of cracks, has since fallen, but the marks of it are\nstill visible.\n\nIt was very narrow.\n\n\"One might get up by the help of that,\" said Montparnasse.\n\n\"By that flue?\" exclaimed Babet, \"a grown-up cove, never! it would take\na brat.\"\n\n\"A brat must be got,\" resumed Brujon.\n\n\"Where are we to find a young 'un?\" said Guelemer.\n\n\"Wait,\" said Montparnasse. \"I've got the very article.\"\n\nHe opened the gate of the fence very softly, made sure that no one was\npassing along the street, stepped out cautiously, shut the gate behind\nhim, and set off at a run in the direction of the Bastille.\n\nSeven or eight minutes elapsed, eight thousand centuries to Thenardier;\nBabet, Brujon, and Guelemer did not open their lips; at last the gate\nopened once more, and Montparnasse appeared, breathless, and followed by\nGavroche. The rain still rendered the street completely deserted.\n\nLittle Gavroche entered the enclosure and gazed at the forms of these\nruffians with a tranquil air. The water was dripping from his hair.\nGuelemer addressed him:--\n\n\"Are you a man, young 'un?\"\n\nGavroche shrugged his shoulders, and replied:--\n\n\"A young 'un like me's a man, and men like you are babes.\"\n\n\"The brat's tongue's well hung!\" exclaimed Babet.\n\n\"The Paris brat ain't made of straw,\" added Brujon.\n\n\"What do you want?\" asked Gavroche.\n\nMontparnasse answered:--\n\n\"Climb up that flue.\"\n\n\"With this rope,\" said Babet.\n\n\"And fasten it,\" continued Brujon.\n\n\"To the top of the wall,\" went on Babet.\n\n\"To the cross-bar of the window,\" added Brujon.\n\n\"And then?\" said Gavroche.\n\n\"There!\" said Guelemer.\n\nThe gamin examined the rope, the flue, the wall, the windows, and made\nthat indescribable and disdainful noise with his lips which signifies:--\n\n\"Is that all!\"\n\n\"There's a man up there whom you are to save,\" resumed Montparnasse.\n\n\"Will you?\" began Brujon again.\n\n\"Greenhorn!\" replied the lad, as though the question appeared a most\nunprecedented one to him.\n\nAnd he took off his shoes.\n\nGuelemer seized Gavroche by one arm, set him on the roof of the shanty,\nwhose worm-eaten planks bent beneath the urchin's weight, and handed\nhim the rope which Brujon had knotted together during Montparnasse's\nabsence. The gamin directed his steps towards the flue, which it was\neasy to enter, thanks to a large crack which touched the roof. At the\nmoment when he was on the point of ascending, Thenardier, who saw life\nand safety approaching, bent over the edge of the wall; the first light\nof dawn struck white upon his brow dripping with sweat, upon his livid\ncheek-bones, his sharp and savage nose, his bristling gray beard, and\nGavroche recognized him.\n\n\"Hullo! it's my father! Oh, that won't hinder.\"\n\nAnd taking the rope in his teeth, he resolutely began the ascent.\n\nHe reached the summit of the hut, bestrode the old wall as though it had\nbeen a horse, and knotted the rope firmly to the upper cross-bar of the\nwindow.\n\nA moment later, Thenardier was in the street.\n\nAs soon as he touched the pavement, as soon as he found himself out\nof danger, he was no longer either weary, or chilled or trembling; the\nterrible things from which he had escaped vanished like smoke, all that\nstrange and ferocious mind awoke once more, and stood erect and free,\nready to march onward.\n\nThese were this man's first words:--\n\n\"Now, whom are we to eat?\"\n\nIt is useless to explain the sense of this frightfully transparent\nremark, which signifies both to kill, to assassinate, and to plunder. To\neat, true sense: to devour.\n\n\"Let's get well into a corner,\" said Brujon. \"Let's settle it in three\nwords, and part at once. There was an affair that promised well in the\nRue Plumet, a deserted street, an isolated house, an old rotten gate on\na garden, and lone women.\"\n\n\"Well! why not?\" demanded Thenardier.\n\n\"Your girl, Eponine, went to see about the matter,\" replied Babet.\n\n\"And she brought a biscuit to Magnon,\" added Guelemer. \"Nothing to be\nmade there.\"\n\n\"The girl's no fool,\" said Thenardier. \"Still, it must be seen to.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes,\" said Brujon, \"it must be looked up.\"\n\nIn the meanwhile, none of the men seemed to see Gavroche, who, during\nthis colloquy, had seated himself on one of the fence-posts; he waited\na few moments, thinking that perhaps his father would turn towards him,\nthen he put on his shoes again, and said:--\n\n\"Is that all? You don't want any more, my men? Now you're out of your\nscrape. I'm off. I must go and get my brats out of bed.\"\n\nAnd off he went.\n\nThe five men emerged, one after another, from the enclosure.\n\nWhen Gavroche had disappeared at the corner of the Rue des Ballets,\nBabet took Thenardier aside.\n\n\"Did you take a good look at that young 'un?\" he asked.\n\n\"What young 'un?\"\n\n\"The one who climbed the wall and carried you the rope.\"\n\n\"Not particularly.\"\n\n\"Well, I don't know, but it strikes me that it was your son.\"\n\n\"Bah!\" said Thenardier, \"do you think so?\"\n\n\n\n\nBOOK SEVENTH.--SLANG\n\n[Illustration: Slang b7-1-slang]\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I--ORIGIN\n\nPigritia is a terrible word.\n\nIt engenders a whole world, la pegre, for which read theft, and a hell,\nla pegrenne, for which read hunger.\n\nThus, idleness is the mother.\n\nShe has a son, theft, and a daughter, hunger.\n\nWhere are we at this moment? In the land of slang.\n\nWhat is slang? It is at one and the same time, a nation and a dialect;\nit is theft in its two kinds; people and language.\n\nWhen, four and thirty years ago, the narrator of this grave and sombre\nhistory introduced into a work written with the same aim as this[39] a\nthief who talked argot, there arose amazement and clamor.--\"What! How!\nArgot! Why, argot is horrible! It is the language of prisons, galleys,\nconvicts, of everything that is most abominable in society!\" etc., etc.\n\nWe have never understood this sort of objections.\n\nSince that time, two powerful romancers, one of whom is a profound\nobserver of the human heart, the other an intrepid friend of the people,\nBalzac and Eugene Sue, having represented their ruffians as talking\ntheir natural language, as the author of The Last Day of a Condemned\nMan did in 1828, the same objections have been raised. People repeated:\n\"What do authors mean by that revolting dialect? Slang is odious! Slang\nmakes one shudder!\"\n\nWho denies that? Of course it does.\n\nWhen it is a question of probing a wound, a gulf, a society, since when\nhas it been considered wrong to go too far? to go to the bottom? We have\nalways thought that it was sometimes a courageous act, and, at least, a\nsimple and useful deed, worthy of the sympathetic attention which duty\naccepted and fulfilled merits. Why should one not explore everything,\nand study everything? Why should one halt on the way? The halt is a\nmatter depending on the sounding-line, and not on the leadsman.\n\nCertainly, too, it is neither an attractive nor an easy task to\nundertake an investigation into the lowest depths of the social order,\nwhere terra firma comes to an end and where mud begins, to rummage in\nthose vague, murky waves, to follow up, to seize and to fling, still\nquivering, upon the pavement that abject dialect which is dripping with\nfilth when thus brought to the light, that pustulous vocabulary each\nword of which seems an unclean ring from a monster of the mire and the\nshadows. Nothing is more lugubrious than the contemplation thus in\nits nudity, in the broad light of thought, of the horrible swarming of\nslang. It seems, in fact, to be a sort of horrible beast made for the\nnight which has just been torn from its cesspool. One thinks one beholds\na frightful, living, and bristling thicket which quivers, rustles,\nwavers, returns to shadow, threatens and glares. One word resembles a\nclaw, another an extinguished and bleeding eye, such and such a phrase\nseems to move like the claw of a crab. All this is alive with\nthe hideous vitality of things which have been organized out of\ndisorganization.\n\nNow, when has horror ever excluded study? Since when has malady banished\nmedicine? Can one imagine a naturalist refusing to study the viper, the\nbat, the scorpion, the centipede, the tarantula, and one who would\ncast them back into their darkness, saying: \"Oh! how ugly that is!\" The\nthinker who should turn aside from slang would resemble a surgeon\nwho should avert his face from an ulcer or a wart. He would be like\na philologist refusing to examine a fact in language, a philosopher\nhesitating to scrutinize a fact in humanity. For, it must be stated\nto those who are ignorant of the case, that argot is both a literary\nphenomenon and a social result. What is slang, properly speaking? It is\nthe language of wretchedness.\n\nWe may be stopped; the fact may be put to us in general terms, which is\none way of attenuating it; we may be told, that all trades, professions,\nit may be added, all the accidents of the social hierarchy and all\nforms of intelligence, have their own slang. The merchant who says:\n\"Montpellier not active, Marseilles fine quality,\" the broker on 'change\nwho says: \"Assets at end of current month,\" the gambler who says: \"Tiers\net tout, refait de pique,\" the sheriff of the Norman Isles who says:\n\"The holder in fee reverting to his landed estate cannot claim the\nfruits of that estate during the hereditary seizure of the real estate\nby the mortgagor,\" the playwright who says: \"The piece was hissed,\"\nthe comedian who says: \"I've made a hit,\" the philosopher who says:\n\"Phenomenal triplicity,\" the huntsman who says: \"Voileci allais,\nVoileci fuyant,\" the phrenologist who says: \"Amativeness, combativeness,\nsecretiveness,\" the infantry soldier who says: \"My shooting-iron,\" the\ncavalry-man who says: \"My turkey-cock,\" the fencing-master who says:\n\"Tierce, quarte, break,\" the printer who says: \"My shooting-stick and\ngalley,\"--all, printer, fencing-master, cavalry dragoon, infantry-man,\nphrenologist, huntsman, philosopher, comedian, playwright, sheriff,\ngambler, stock-broker, and merchant, speak slang. The painter who says:\n\"My grinder,\" the notary who says: \"My Skip-the-Gutter,\" the hairdresser\nwho says: \"My mealyback,\" the cobbler who says: \"My cub,\" talks slang.\nStrictly speaking, if one absolutely insists on the point, all the\ndifferent fashions of saying the right and the left, the sailor's port\nand starboard, the scene-shifter's court-side, and garden-side, the\nbeadle's Gospel-side and Epistle-side, are slang. There is the slang of\nthe affected lady as well as of the precieuses. The Hotel Rambouillet\nnearly adjoins the Cour des Miracles. There is a slang of duchesses,\nwitness this phrase contained in a love-letter from a very great lady\nand a very pretty woman of the Restoration: \"You will find in this\ngossip a fultitude of reasons why I should libertize.\"[40] Diplomatic\nciphers are slang; the pontifical chancellery by using 26 for Rome,\ngrkztntgzyal for despatch, and abfxustgrnogrkzu tu XI. for the Due de\nModena, speaks slang. The physicians of the Middle Ages who, for\ncarrot, radish, and turnip, said Opoponach, perfroschinum,\nreptitalmus, dracatholicum, angelorum, postmegorum, talked slang. The\nsugar-manufacturer who says: \"Loaf, clarified, lumps, bastard, common,\nburnt,\"--this honest manufacturer talks slang. A certain school of\ncriticism twenty years ago, which used to say: \"Half of the works of\nShakespeare consists of plays upon words and puns,\"--talked slang. The\npoet, and the artist who, with profound understanding, would designate\nM. de Montmorency as \"a bourgeois,\" if he were not a judge of verses and\nstatues, speak slang. The classic Academician who calls flowers \"Flora,\"\nfruits, \"Pomona,\" the sea, \"Neptune,\" love, \"fires,\" beauty, \"charms,\"\na horse, \"a courser,\" the white or tricolored cockade, \"the rose of\nBellona,\" the three-cornered hat, \"Mars' triangle,\"--that classical\nAcademician talks slang. Algebra, medicine, botany, have each their\nslang. The tongue which is employed on board ship, that wonderful\nlanguage of the sea, which is so complete and so picturesque, which was\nspoken by Jean Bart, Duquesne, Suffren, and Duperre, which mingles with\nthe whistling of the rigging, the sound of the speaking-trumpets, the\nshock of the boarding-irons, the roll of the sea, the wind, the gale,\nthe cannon, is wholly a heroic and dazzling slang, which is to the\nfierce slang of the thieves what the lion is to the jackal.\n\nNo doubt. But say what we will, this manner of understanding the word\nslang is an extension which every one will not admit. For our part,\nwe reserve to the word its ancient and precise, circumscribed and\ndetermined significance, and we restrict slang to slang. The veritable\nslang and the slang that is pre-eminently slang, if the two words can be\ncoupled thus, the slang immemorial which was a kingdom, is nothing\nelse, we repeat, than the homely, uneasy, crafty, treacherous, venomous,\ncruel, equivocal, vile, profound, fatal tongue of wretchedness. There\nexists, at the extremity of all abasement and all misfortunes, a last\nmisery which revolts and makes up its mind to enter into conflict\nwith the whole mass of fortunate facts and reigning rights; a fearful\nconflict, where, now cunning, now violent, unhealthy and ferocious\nat one and the same time, it attacks the social order with pin-pricks\nthrough vice, and with club-blows through crime. To meet the needs of\nthis conflict, wretchedness has invented a language of combat, which is\nslang.\n\nTo keep afloat and to rescue from oblivion, to hold above the gulf, were\nit but a fragment of some language which man has spoken and which would,\notherwise, be lost, that is to say, one of the elements, good or bad, of\nwhich civilization is composed, or by which it is complicated, to extend\nthe records of social observation; is to serve civilization itself. This\nservice Plautus rendered, consciously or unconsciously, by making two\nCarthaginian soldiers talk Phoenician; that service Moliere rendered,\nby making so many of his characters talk Levantine and all sorts of\ndialects. Here objections spring up afresh. Phoenician, very good!\nLevantine, quite right! Even dialect, let that pass! They are tongues\nwhich have belonged to nations or provinces; but slang! What is the use\nof preserving slang? What is the good of assisting slang \"to survive\"?\n\nTo this we reply in one word, only. Assuredly, if the tongue which a\nnation or a province has spoken is worthy of interest, the language\nwhich has been spoken by a misery is still more worthy of attention and\nstudy.\n\nIt is the language which has been spoken, in France, for example, for\nmore than four centuries, not only by a misery, but by every possible\nhuman misery.\n\nAnd then, we insist upon it, the study of social deformities and\ninfirmities, and the task of pointing them out with a view to remedy,\nis not a business in which choice is permitted. The historian of manners\nand ideas has no less austere a mission than the historian of events.\nThe latter has the surface of civilization, the conflicts of crowns, the\nbirths of princes, the marriages of kings, battles, assemblages, great\npublic men, revolutions in the daylight, everything on the exterior;\nthe other historian has the interior, the depths, the people who toil,\nsuffer, wait, the oppressed woman, the agonizing child, the secret war\nbetween man and man, obscure ferocities, prejudices, plotted\niniquities, the subterranean, the indistinct tremors of multitudes, the\ndie-of-hunger, the counter-blows of the law, the secret evolution of\nsouls, the go-bare-foot, the bare-armed, the disinherited, the orphans,\nthe unhappy, and the infamous, all the forms which roam through the\ndarkness. He must descend with his heart full of charity, and severity\nat the same time, as a brother and as a judge, to those impenetrable\ncasemates where crawl, pell-mell, those who bleed and those who deal the\nblow, those who weep and those who curse, those who fast and those\nwho devour, those who endure evil and those who inflict it. Have these\nhistorians of hearts and souls duties at all inferior to the historians\nof external facts? Does any one think that Alighieri has any fewer\nthings to say than Machiavelli? Is the under side of civilization any\nless important than the upper side merely because it is deeper and more\nsombre? Do we really know the mountain well when we are not acquainted\nwith the cavern?\n\nLet us say, moreover, parenthetically, that from a few words of what\nprecedes a marked separation might be inferred between the two classes\nof historians which does not exist in our mind. No one is a good\nhistorian of the patent, visible, striking, and public life of peoples,\nif he is not, at the same time, in a certain measure, the historian\nof their deep and hidden life; and no one is a good historian of the\ninterior unless he understands how, at need, to be the historian of the\nexterior also. The history of manners and ideas permeates the history\nof events, and this is true reciprocally. They constitute two different\norders of facts which correspond to each other, which are always\ninterlaced, and which often bring forth results. All the lineaments\nwhich providence traces on the surface of a nation have their parallels,\nsombre but distinct, in their depths, and all convulsions of the depths\nproduce ebullitions on the surface. True history being a mixture of all\nthings, the true historian mingles in everything.\n\nMan is not a circle with a single centre; he is an ellipse with a double\nfocus. Facts form one of these, and ideas the other.\n\nSlang is nothing but a dressing-room where the tongue having some\nbad action to perform, disguises itself. There it clothes itself in\nword-masks, in metaphor-rags. In this guise it becomes horrible.\n\nOne finds it difficult to recognize. Is it really the French tongue, the\ngreat human tongue? Behold it ready to step upon the stage and to retort\nupon crime, and prepared for all the employments of the repertory of\nevil. It no longer walks, it hobbles; it limps on the crutch of the\nCourt of Miracles, a crutch metamorphosable into a club; it is called\nvagrancy; every sort of spectre, its dressers, have painted its face, it\ncrawls and rears, the double gait of the reptile. Henceforth, it is apt\nat all roles, it is made suspicious by the counterfeiter, covered with\nverdigris by the forger, blacked by the soot of the incendiary; and the\nmurderer applies its rouge.\n\nWhen one listens, by the side of honest men, at the portals of society,\none overhears the dialogues of those who are on the outside.\nOne distinguishes questions and replies. One perceives, without\nunderstanding it, a hideous murmur, sounding almost like human accents,\nbut more nearly resembling a howl than an articulate word. It is slang.\nThe words are misshapen and stamped with an indescribable and fantastic\nbestiality. One thinks one hears hydras talking.\n\nIt is unintelligible in the dark. It gnashes and whispers, completing\nthe gloom with mystery. It is black in misfortune, it is blacker still\nin crime; these two blacknesses amalgamated, compose slang. Obscurity\nin the atmosphere, obscurity in acts, obscurity in voices. Terrible,\ntoad-like tongue which goes and comes, leaps, crawls, slobbers, and\nstirs about in monstrous wise in that immense gray fog composed of rain\nand night, of hunger, of vice, of falsehood, of injustice, of nudity, of\nsuffocation, and of winter, the high noonday of the miserable.\n\nLet us have compassion on the chastised. Alas! Who are we ourselves? Who\nam I who now address you? Who are you who are listening to me? And are\nyou very sure that we have done nothing before we were born? The earth\nis not devoid of resemblance to a jail. Who knows whether man is not a\nrecaptured offender against divine justice? Look closely at life. It is\nso made, that everywhere we feel the sense of punishment.\n\nAre you what is called a happy man? Well! you are sad every day. Each\nday has its own great grief or its little care. Yesterday you were\ntrembling for a health that is dear to you, to-day you fear for your\nown; to-morrow it will be anxiety about money, the day after to-morrow\nthe diatribe of a slanderer, the day after that, the misfortune of some\nfriend; then the prevailing weather, then something that has been broken\nor lost, then a pleasure with which your conscience and your vertebral\ncolumn reproach you; again, the course of public affairs. This without\nreckoning in the pains of the heart. And so it goes on. One cloud is\ndispelled, another forms. There is hardly one day out of a hundred which\nis wholly joyous and sunny. And you belong to that small class who are\nhappy! As for the rest of mankind, stagnating night rests upon them.\n\nThoughtful minds make but little use of the phrase: the fortunate and\nthe unfortunate. In this world, evidently the vestibule of another,\nthere are no fortunate.\n\nThe real human division is this: the luminous and the shady. To diminish\nthe number of the shady, to augment the number of the luminous,--that\nis the object. That is why we cry: Education! science! To teach reading,\nmeans to light the fire; every syllable spelled out sparkles.\n\nHowever, he who says light does not, necessarily, say joy. People suffer\nin the light; excess burns. The flame is the enemy of the wing. To burn\nwithout ceasing to fly,--therein lies the marvel of genius.\n\nWhen you shall have learned to know, and to love, you will still suffer.\nThe day is born in tears. The luminous weep, if only over those in\ndarkness.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II--ROOTS\n\nSlang is the tongue of those who sit in darkness.\n\nThought is moved in its most sombre depths, social philosophy is bidden\nto its most poignant meditations, in the presence of that enigmatic\ndialect at once so blighted and rebellious. Therein lies chastisement\nmade visible. Every syllable has an air of being marked. The words of\nthe vulgar tongue appear therein wrinkled and shrivelled, as it were,\nbeneath the hot iron of the executioner. Some seem to be still smoking.\nSuch and such a phrase produces upon you the effect of the shoulder of a\nthief branded with the fleur-de-lys, which has suddenly been laid bare.\nIdeas almost refuse to be expressed in these substantives which are\nfugitives from justice. Metaphor is sometimes so shameless, that one\nfeels that it has worn the iron neck-fetter.\n\nMoreover, in spite of all this, and because of all this, this strange\ndialect has by rights, its own compartment in that great impartial case\nof pigeon-holes where there is room for the rusty farthing as well as\nfor the gold medal, and which is called literature. Slang, whether the\npublic admit the fact or not has its syntax and its poetry. It is a\nlanguage. Yes, by the deformity of certain terms, we recognize the\nfact that it was chewed by Mandrin, and by the splendor of certain\nmetonymies, we feel that Villon spoke it.\n\nThat exquisite and celebrated verse--\n\n          Mais ou sont les neiges d'antan?\n          But where are the snows of years gone by?\n\nis a verse of slang. Antam--ante annum--is a word of Thunes slang, which\nsignified the past year, and by extension, formerly. Thirty-five years\nago, at the epoch of the departure of the great chain-gang, there could\nbe read in one of the cells at Bicetre, this maxim engraved with a\nnail on the wall by a king of Thunes condemned to the galleys: Les dabs\nd'antan trimaient siempre pour la pierre du Coesre. This means Kings in\ndays gone by always went and had themselves anointed. In the opinion of\nthat king, anointment meant the galleys.\n\nThe word decarade, which expresses the departure of heavy vehicles at\na gallop, is attributed to Villon, and it is worthy of him. This word,\nwhich strikes fire with all four of its feet, sums up in a masterly\nonomatopoeia the whole of La Fontaine's admirable verse:--\n\n          Six forts chevaux tiraient un coche.\n          Six stout horses drew a coach.\n\n\nFrom a purely literary point of view, few studies would prove more\ncurious and fruitful than the study of slang. It is a whole language\nwithin a language, a sort of sickly excrescence, an unhealthy graft\nwhich has produced a vegetation, a parasite which has its roots in the\nold Gallic trunk, and whose sinister foliage crawls all over one side of\nthe language. This is what may be called the first, the vulgar aspect of\nslang. But, for those who study the tongue as it should be studied, that\nis to say, as geologists study the earth, slang appears like a veritable\nalluvial deposit. According as one digs a longer or shorter distance\ninto it, one finds in slang, below the old popular French, Provencal,\nSpanish, Italian, Levantine, that language of the Mediterranean ports,\nEnglish and German, the Romance language in its three varieties, French,\nItalian, and Romance Romance, Latin, and finally Basque and Celtic. A\nprofound and unique formation. A subterranean edifice erected in common\nby all the miserable. Each accursed race has deposited its layer, each\nsuffering has dropped its stone there, each heart has contributed its\npebble. A throng of evil, base, or irritated souls, who have traversed\nlife and have vanished into eternity, linger there almost entirely\nvisible still beneath the form of some monstrous word.\n\nDo you want Spanish? The old Gothic slang abounded in it. Here is\nboffete, a box on the ear, which is derived from bofeton; vantane,\nwindow (later on vanterne), which comes from vantana; gat, cat, which\ncomes from gato; acite, oil, which comes from aceyte. Do you want\nItalian? Here is spade, sword, which comes from spada; carvel, boat,\nwhich comes from caravella. Do you want English? Here is bichot, which\ncomes from bishop; raille, spy, which comes from rascal, rascalion;\npilche, a case, which comes from pilcher, a sheath. Do you want German?\nHere is the caleur, the waiter, kellner; the hers, the master, herzog\n(duke). Do you want Latin? Here is frangir, to break, frangere; affurer,\nto steal, fur; cadene, chain, catena. There is one word which crops up\nin every language of the continent, with a sort of mysterious power and\nauthority. It is the word magnus; the Scotchman makes of it his mac,\nwhich designates the chief of the clan; Mac-Farlane, Mac-Callumore, the\ngreat Farlane, the great Callumore[41]; slang turns it into meck and\nlater le meg, that is to say, God. Would you like Basque? Here is\ngahisto, the devil, which comes from gaiztoa, evil; sorgabon, good\nnight, which comes from gabon, good evening. Do you want Celtic? Here is\nblavin, a handkerchief, which comes from blavet, gushing water; menesse,\na woman (in a bad sense), which comes from meinec, full of stones;\nbarant, brook, from baranton, fountain; goffeur, locksmith, from goff,\nblacksmith; guedouze, death, which comes from guenn-du, black-white.\nFinally, would you like history? Slang calls crowns les malteses, a\nsouvenir of the coin in circulation on the galleys of Malta.\n\nIn addition to the philological origins just indicated, slang possesses\nother and still more natural roots, which spring, so to speak, from the\nmind of man itself.\n\nIn the first place, the direct creation of words. Therein lies the\nmystery of tongues. To paint with words, which contains figures\none knows not how or why, is the primitive foundation of all human\nlanguages, what may be called their granite.\n\nSlang abounds in words of this description, immediate words, words\ncreated instantaneously no one knows either where or by whom, without\netymology, without analogies, without derivatives, solitary, barbarous,\nsometimes hideous words, which at times possess a singular power of\nexpression and which live. The executioner, le taule; the forest,\nle sabri; fear, flight, taf; the lackey, le larbin; the mineral,\nthe prefect, the minister, pharos; the devil, le rabouin. Nothing is\nstranger than these words which both mask and reveal. Some, le rabouin,\nfor example, are at the same time grotesque and terrible, and produce on\nyou the effect of a cyclopean grimace.\n\nIn the second place, metaphor. The peculiarity of a language which is\ndesirous of saying all yet concealing all is that it is rich in figures.\nMetaphor is an enigma, wherein the thief who is plotting a stroke,\nthe prisoner who is arranging an escape, take refuge. No idiom is more\nmetaphorical than slang: devisser le coco (to unscrew the nut), to twist\nthe neck; tortiller (to wriggle), to eat; etre gerbe, to be tried; a\nrat, a bread thief; il lansquine, it rains, a striking, ancient figure\nwhich partly bears its date about it, which assimilates long oblique\nlines of rain, with the dense and slanting pikes of the lancers, and\nwhich compresses into a single word the popular expression: it rains\nhalberds. Sometimes, in proportion as slang progresses from the first\nepoch to the second, words pass from the primitive and savage sense to\nthe metaphorical sense. The devil ceases to be le rabouin, and becomes\nle boulanger (the baker), who puts the bread into the oven. This is\nmore witty, but less grand, something like Racine after Corneille, like\nEuripides after AEschylus. Certain slang phrases which participate\nin the two epochs and have at once the barbaric character and the\nmetaphorical character resemble phantasmagories. Les sorgueuers vont\nsolliciter des gails a la lune--the prowlers are going to steal horses\nby night,--this passes before the mind like a group of spectres. One\nknows not what one sees.\n\nIn the third place, the expedient. Slang lives on the language. It uses\nit in accordance with its fancy, it dips into it hap-hazard, and it\noften confines itself, when occasion arises, to alter it in a gross and\nsummary fashion. Occasionally, with the ordinary words thus deformed and\ncomplicated with words of pure slang, picturesque phrases are formed, in\nwhich there can be felt the mixture of the two preceding elements, the\ndirect creation and the metaphor: le cab jaspine, je marronne que la\nroulotte de Pantin trime dans le sabri, the dog is barking, I suspect\nthat the diligence for Paris is passing through the woods. Le dab est\nsinve, la dabuge est merloussiere, la fee est bative, the bourgeois is\nstupid, the bourgeoise is cunning, the daughter is pretty. Generally,\nto throw listeners off the track, slang confines itself to adding to\nall the words of the language without distinction, an ignoble tail, a\ntermination in aille, in orgue, in iergue, or in uche. Thus: Vousiergue\ntrouvaille bonorgue ce gigotmuche? Do you think that leg of mutton\ngood? A phrase addressed by Cartouche to a turnkey in order to find out\nwhether the sum offered for his escape suited him.\n\nThe termination in mar has been added recently.\n\nSlang, being the dialect of corruption, quickly becomes corrupted\nitself. Besides this, as it is always seeking concealment, as soon as\nit feels that it is understood, it changes its form. Contrary to what\nhappens with every other vegetation, every ray of light which falls\nupon it kills whatever it touches. Thus slang is in constant process of\ndecomposition and recomposition; an obscure and rapid work which never\npauses. It passes over more ground in ten years than a language in ten\ncenturies. Thus le larton (bread) becomes le lartif; le gail (horse)\nbecomes le gaye; la fertanche (straw) becomes la fertille; le momignard\n(brat), le momacque; les fiques (duds), frusques; la chique (the\nchurch), l'egrugeoir; le colabre (neck), le colas. The devil is at\nfirst, gahisto, then le rabouin, then the baker; the priest is a\nratichon, then the boar (le sanglier); the dagger is le vingt-deux\n(twenty-two), then le surin, then le lingre; the police are railles,\nthen roussins, then rousses, then marchands de lacets (dealers in\nstay-laces), then coquers, then cognes; the executioner is le taule,\nthen Charlot, l'atigeur, then le becquillard. In the seventeenth\ncentury, to fight was \"to give each other snuff\"; in the nineteenth\nit is \"to chew each other's throats.\" There have been twenty different\nphrases between these two extremes. Cartouche's talk would have been\nHebrew to Lacenaire. All the words of this language are perpetually\nengaged in flight like the men who utter them.\n\nStill, from time to time, and in consequence of this very movement,\nthe ancient slang crops up again and becomes new once more. It has its\nheadquarters where it maintains its sway. The Temple preserved the slang\nof the seventeenth century; Bicetre, when it was a prison, preserved the\nslang of Thunes. There one could hear the termination in anche of\nthe old Thuneurs. Boyanches-tu (bois-tu), do you drink? But perpetual\nmovement remains its law, nevertheless.\n\nIf the philosopher succeeds in fixing, for a moment, for purposes of\nobservation, this language which is incessantly evaporating, he falls\ninto doleful and useful meditation. No study is more efficacious and\nmore fecund in instruction. There is not a metaphor, not an analogy, in\nslang, which does not contain a lesson. Among these men, to beat means\nto feign; one beats a malady; ruse is their strength.\n\nFor them, the idea of the man is not separated from the idea of\ndarkness. The night is called la sorgue; man, l'orgue. Man is a\nderivative of the night.\n\nThey have taken up the practice of considering society in the light\nof an atmosphere which kills them, of a fatal force, and they speak of\ntheir liberty as one would speak of his health. A man under arrest is a\nsick man; one who is condemned is a dead man.\n\nThe most terrible thing for the prisoner within the four walls in which\nhe is buried, is a sort of glacial chastity, and he calls the dungeon\nthe castus. In that funereal place, life outside always presents itself\nunder its most smiling aspect. The prisoner has irons on his feet; you\nthink, perhaps, that his thought is that it is with the feet that one\nwalks? No; he is thinking that it is with the feet that one dances; so,\nwhen he has succeeded in severing his fetters, his first idea is that\nnow he can dance, and he calls the saw the bastringue (public-house\nball).--A name is a centre; profound assimilation.--The ruffian has two\nheads, one of which reasons out his actions and leads him all his life\nlong, and the other which he has upon his shoulders on the day of his\ndeath; he calls the head which counsels him in crime la sorbonne,\nand the head which expiates it la tronche.--When a man has no longer\nanything but rags upon his body and vices in his heart, when he has\narrived at that double moral and material degradation which the word\nblackguard characterizes in its two acceptations, he is ripe for crime;\nhe is like a well-whetted knife; he has two cutting edges, his\ndistress and his malice; so slang does not say a blackguard, it says\nun reguise.--What are the galleys? A brazier of damnation, a hell. The\nconvict calls himself a fagot.--And finally, what name do malefactors\ngive to their prison? The college. A whole penitentiary system can be\nevolved from that word.\n\nDoes the reader wish to know where the majority of the songs of the\ngalleys, those refrains called in the special vocabulary lirlonfa, have\nhad their birth?\n\nLet him listen to what follows:--\n\nThere existed at the Chatelet in Paris a large and long cellar. This\ncellar was eight feet below the level of the Seine. It had neither\nwindows nor air-holes, its only aperture was the door; men could enter\nthere, air could not. This vault had for ceiling a vault of stone, and\nfor floor ten inches of mud. It was flagged; but the pavement had rotted\nand cracked under the oozing of the water. Eight feet above the floor,\na long and massive beam traversed this subterranean excavation from side\nto side; from this beam hung, at short distances apart, chains three\nfeet long, and at the end of these chains there were rings for the\nneck. In this vault, men who had been condemned to the galleys were\nincarcerated until the day of their departure for Toulon. They were\nthrust under this beam, where each one found his fetters swinging in the\ndarkness and waiting for him.\n\nThe chains, those pendant arms, and the necklets, those open hands,\ncaught the unhappy wretches by the throat. They were rivetted and\nleft there. As the chain was too short, they could not lie down. They\nremained motionless in that cavern, in that night, beneath that beam,\nalmost hanging, forced to unheard-of efforts to reach their bread, jug,\nor their vault overhead, mud even to mid-leg, filth flowing to their\nvery calves, broken asunder with fatigue, with thighs and knees giving\nway, clinging fast to the chain with their hands in order to obtain some\nrest, unable to sleep except when standing erect, and awakened every\nmoment by the strangling of the collar; some woke no more. In order to\neat, they pushed the bread, which was flung to them in the mud, along\ntheir leg with their heel until it reached their hand.\n\nHow long did they remain thus? One month, two months, six months\nsometimes; one stayed a year. It was the antechamber of the galleys.\nMen were put there for stealing a hare from the king. In this\nsepulchre-hell, what did they do? What man can do in a sepulchre, they\nwent through the agonies of death, and what can man do in hell, they\nsang; for song lingers where there is no longer any hope. In the waters\nof Malta, when a galley was approaching, the song could be heard before\nthe sound of the oars. Poor Survincent, the poacher, who had gone\nthrough the prison-cellar of the Chatelet, said: \"It was the rhymes that\nkept me up.\" Uselessness of poetry. What is the good of rhyme?\n\nIt is in this cellar that nearly all the slang songs had their birth.\nIt is from the dungeon of the Grand-Chatelet of Paris that comes\nthe melancholy refrain of the Montgomery galley: \"Timaloumisaine,\ntimaloumison.\" The majority of these:\n\n       Icicaille est la theatre        Here is the theatre\n       Du petit dardant.               Of the little archer (Cupid).\n\n\nDo what you will, you cannot annihilate that eternal relic in the heart\nof man, love.\n\nIn this world of dismal deeds, people keep their secrets. The secret is\nthe thing above all others. The secret, in the eyes of these wretches,\nis unity which serves as a base of union. To betray a secret is to\ntear from each member of this fierce community something of his own\npersonality. To inform against, in the energetic slang dialect, is\ncalled: \"to eat the bit.\" As though the informer drew to himself a\nlittle of the substance of all and nourished himself on a bit of each\none's flesh.\n\nWhat does it signify to receive a box on the ear? Commonplace metaphor\nreplies: \"It is to see thirty-six candles.\"\n\nHere slang intervenes and takes it up: Candle, camoufle. Thereupon, the\nordinary tongue gives camouflet[42] as the synonym for soufflet. Thus,\nby a sort of infiltration from below upwards, with the aid of metaphor,\nthat incalculable, trajectory slang mounts from the cavern to the\nAcademy; and Poulailler saying: \"I light my camoufle,\" causes Voltaire\nto write: \"Langleviel La Beaumelle deserves a hundred camouflets.\"\n\nResearches in slang mean discoveries at every step. Study and\ninvestigation of this strange idiom lead to the mysterious point of\nintersection of regular society with society which is accursed.\n\nThe thief also has his food for cannon, stealable matter, you, I,\nwhoever passes by; le pantre. (Pan, everybody.)\n\nSlang is language turned convict.\n\nThat the thinking principle of man be thrust down ever so low, that it\ncan be dragged and pinioned there by obscure tyrannies of fatality,\nthat it can be bound by no one knows what fetters in that abyss, is\nsufficient to create consternation.\n\nOh, poor thought of miserable wretches!\n\nAlas! will no one come to the succor of the human soul in that darkness?\nIs it her destiny there to await forever the mind, the liberator, the\nimmense rider of Pegasi and hippo-griffs, the combatant of heroes of\nthe dawn who shall descend from the azure between two wings, the radiant\nknight of the future? Will she forever summon in vain to her assistance\nthe lance of light of the ideal? Is she condemned to hear the fearful\napproach of Evil through the density of the gulf, and to catch glimpses,\nnearer and nearer at hand, beneath the hideous water of that dragon's\nhead, that maw streaked with foam, and that writhing undulation of\nclaws, swellings, and rings? Must it remain there, without a gleam\nof light, without hope, given over to that terrible approach, vaguely\nscented out by the monster, shuddering, dishevelled, wringing its arms,\nforever chained to the rock of night, a sombre Andromeda white and naked\namid the shadows!\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III--SLANG WHICH WEEPS AND SLANG WHICH LAUGHS\n\nAs the reader perceives, slang in its entirety, slang of four hundred\nyears ago, like the slang of to-day, is permeated with that sombre,\nsymbolical spirit which gives to all words a mien which is now mournful,\nnow menacing. One feels in it the wild and ancient sadness of those\nvagrants of the Court of Miracles who played at cards with packs of\ntheir own, some of which have come down to us. The eight of clubs, for\ninstance, represented a huge tree bearing eight enormous trefoil leaves,\na sort of fantastic personification of the forest. At the foot of this\ntree a fire was burning, over which three hares were roasting a huntsman\non a spit, and behind him, on another fire, hung a steaming pot, whence\nemerged the head of a dog. Nothing can be more melancholy than these\nreprisals in painting, by a pack of cards, in the presence of stakes\nfor the roasting of smugglers and of the cauldron for the boiling of\ncounterfeiters. The diverse forms assumed by thought in the realm\nof slang, even song, even raillery, even menace, all partook of this\npowerless and dejected character. All the songs, the melodies of some\nof which have been collected, were humble and lamentable to the point of\nevoking tears. The pegre is always the poor pegre, and he is always\nthe hare in hiding, the fugitive mouse, the flying bird. He hardly\ncomplains, he contents himself with sighing; one of his moans has come\ndown to us: \"I do not understand how God, the father of men, can torture\nhis children and his grandchildren and hear them cry, without himself\nsuffering torture.\"[43] The wretch, whenever he has time to think, makes\nhimself small before the low, and frail in the presence of society;\nhe lies down flat on his face, he entreats, he appeals to the side of\ncompassion; we feel that he is conscious of his guilt.\n\nTowards the middle of the last century a change took place, prison songs\nand thieves' ritournelles assumed, so to speak, an insolent and jovial\nmien. The plaintive malure was replaced by the larifla. We find in the\neighteenth century, in nearly all the songs of the galleys and prisons,\na diabolical and enigmatical gayety. We hear this strident and lilting\nrefrain which we should say had been lighted up by a phosphorescent\ngleam, and which seems to have been flung into the forest by a\nwill-o'-the-wisp playing the fife:--\n\n                    Miralabi suslababo\n                    Mirliton ribonribette\n                    Surlababi mirlababo\n                    Mirliton ribonribo.\n\n\nThis was sung in a cellar or in a nook of the forest while cutting a\nman's throat.\n\nA serious symptom. In the eighteenth century, the ancient melancholy of\nthe dejected classes vanishes. They began to laugh. They rally the grand\nmeg and the grand dab. Given Louis XV. they call the King of France \"le\nMarquis de Pantin.\" And behold, they are almost gay. A sort of gleam\nproceeds from these miserable wretches, as though their consciences were\nnot heavy within them any more. These lamentable tribes of darkness have\nno longer merely the desperate audacity of actions, they possess the\nheedless audacity of mind. A sign that they are losing the sense of\ntheir criminality, and that they feel, even among thinkers and dreamers,\nsome indefinable support which the latter themselves know not of. A\nsign that theft and pillage are beginning to filter into doctrines and\nsophisms, in such a way as to lose somewhat of their ugliness, while\ncommunicating much of it to sophisms and doctrines. A sign, in short, of\nsome outbreak which is prodigious and near unless some diversion shall\narise.\n\nLet us pause a moment. Whom are we accusing here? Is it the eighteenth\ncentury? Is it philosophy? Certainly not. The work of the eighteenth\ncentury is healthy and good and wholesome. The encyclopedists, Diderot\nat their head; the physiocrates, Turgot at their head; the philosophers,\nVoltaire at their head; the Utopians, Rousseau at their head,--these are\nfour sacred legions. Humanity's immense advance towards the light is due\nto them. They are the four vanguards of the human race, marching towards\nthe four cardinal points of progress. Diderot towards the beautiful,\nTurgot towards the useful, Voltaire towards the true, Rousseau towards\nthe just. But by the side of and above the philosophers, there were the\nsophists, a venomous vegetation mingled with a healthy growth, hemlock\nin the virgin forest. While the executioner was burning the great\nbooks of the liberators of the century on the grand staircase of the\ncourt-house, writers now forgotten were publishing, with the King's\nsanction, no one knows what strangely disorganizing writings, which were\neagerly read by the unfortunate. Some of these publications, odd to\nsay, which were patronized by a prince, are to be found in the Secret\nLibrary. These facts, significant but unknown, were imperceptible on the\nsurface. Sometimes, in the very obscurity of a fact lurks its danger.\nIt is obscure because it is underhand. Of all these writers, the one\nwho probably then excavated in the masses the most unhealthy gallery was\nRestif de La Bretonne.\n\nThis work, peculiar to the whole of Europe, effected more ravages in\nGermany than anywhere else. In Germany, during a given period, summed up\nby Schiller in his famous drama The Robbers, theft and pillage rose up\nin protest against property and labor, assimilated certain specious and\nfalse elementary ideas, which, though just in appearance, were absurd in\nreality, enveloped themselves in these ideas, disappeared within them,\nafter a fashion, assumed an abstract name, passed into the state of\ntheory, and in that shape circulated among the laborious, suffering, and\nhonest masses, unknown even to the imprudent chemists who had prepared\nthe mixture, unknown even to the masses who accepted it. Whenever a fact\nof this sort presents itself, the case is grave. Suffering engenders\nwrath; and while the prosperous classes blind themselves or fall asleep,\nwhich is the same thing as shutting one's eyes, the hatred of the\nunfortunate classes lights its torch at some aggrieved or ill-made\nspirit which dreams in a corner, and sets itself to the scrutiny of\nsociety. The scrutiny of hatred is a terrible thing.\n\nHence, if the ill-fortune of the times so wills it, those fearful\ncommotions which were formerly called jacqueries, beside which purely\npolitical agitations are the merest child's play, which are no longer\nthe conflict of the oppressed and the oppressor, but the revolt of\ndiscomfort against comfort. Then everything crumbles.\n\nJacqueries are earthquakes of the people.\n\nIt is this peril, possibly imminent towards the close of the eighteenth\ncentury, which the French Revolution, that immense act of probity, cut\nshort.\n\nThe French Revolution, which is nothing else than the idea armed with\nthe sword, rose erect, and, with the same abrupt movement, closed the\ndoor of ill and opened the door of good.\n\nIt put a stop to torture, promulgated the truth, expelled miasma,\nrendered the century healthy, crowned the populace.\n\nIt may be said of it that it created man a second time, by giving him a\nsecond soul, the right.\n\nThe nineteenth century has inherited and profited by its work, and\nto-day, the social catastrophe to which we lately alluded is simply\nimpossible. Blind is he who announces it! Foolish is he who fears it!\nRevolution is the vaccine of Jacquerie.\n\nThanks to the Revolution, social conditions have changed. Feudal and\nmonarchical maladies no longer run in our blood. There is no more of\nthe Middle Ages in our constitution. We no longer live in the days when\nterrible swarms within made irruptions, when one heard beneath his feet\nthe obscure course of a dull rumble, when indescribable elevations from\nmole-like tunnels appeared on the surface of civilization, where the\nsoil cracked open, where the roofs of caverns yawned, and where one\nsuddenly beheld monstrous heads emerging from the earth.\n\nThe revolutionary sense is a moral sense. The sentiment of right, once\ndeveloped, develops the sentiment of duty. The law of all is\nliberty, which ends where the liberty of others begins, according to\nRobespierre's admirable definition. Since '89, the whole people has\nbeen dilating into a sublime individual; there is not a poor man, who,\npossessing his right, has not his ray of sun; the die-of-hunger feels\nwithin him the honesty of France; the dignity of the citizen is an\ninternal armor; he who is free is scrupulous; he who votes reigns. Hence\nincorruptibility; hence the miscarriage of unhealthy lusts; hence eyes\nheroically lowered before temptations. The revolutionary wholesomeness\nis such, that on a day of deliverance, a 14th of July, a 10th of August,\nthere is no longer any populace. The first cry of the enlightened and\nincreasing throngs is: death to thieves! Progress is an honest man; the\nideal and the absolute do not filch pocket-handkerchiefs. By whom were\nthe wagons containing the wealth of the Tuileries escorted in 1848? By\nthe rag-pickers of the Faubourg Saint-Antoine. Rags mounted guard over\nthe treasure. Virtue rendered these tatterdemalions resplendent. In\nthose wagons in chests, hardly closed, and some, even, half-open, amid a\nhundred dazzling caskets, was that ancient crown of France, studded with\ndiamonds, surmounted by the carbuncle of royalty, by the Regent diamond,\nwhich was worth thirty millions. Barefooted, they guarded that crown.\n\nHence, no more Jacquerie. I regret it for the sake of the skilful. The\nold fear has produced its last effects in that quarter; and henceforth\nit can no longer be employed in politics. The principal spring of the\nred spectre is broken. Every one knows it now. The scare-crow scares\nno longer. The birds take liberties with the mannikin, foul creatures\nalight upon it, the bourgeois laugh at it.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV--THE TWO DUTIES: TO WATCH AND TO HOPE\n\nThis being the case, is all social danger dispelled? Certainly not.\nThere is no Jacquerie; society may rest assured on that point; blood\nwill no longer rush to its head. But let society take heed to the manner\nin which it breathes. Apoplexy is no longer to be feared, but phthisis\nis there. Social phthisis is called misery.\n\nOne can perish from being undermined as well as from being struck by\nlightning.\n\nLet us not weary of repeating, and sympathetic souls must not forget\nthat this is the first of fraternal obligations, and selfish hearts must\nunderstand that the first of political necessities consists in thinking\nfirst of all of the disinherited and sorrowing throngs, in solacing,\nairing, enlightening, loving them, in enlarging their horizon to a\nmagnificent extent, in lavishing upon them education in every form, in\noffering them the example of labor, never the example of idleness,\nin diminishing the individual burden by enlarging the notion of the\nuniversal aim, in setting a limit to poverty without setting a limit\nto wealth, in creating vast fields of public and popular activity, in\nhaving, like Briareus, a hundred hands to extend in all directions to\nthe oppressed and the feeble, in employing the collective power for that\ngrand duty of opening workshops for all arms, schools for all aptitudes,\nand laboratories for all degrees of intelligence, in augmenting\nsalaries, diminishing trouble, balancing what should be and what is,\nthat is to say, in proportioning enjoyment to effort and a glut to need;\nin a word, in evolving from the social apparatus more light and more\ncomfort for the benefit of those who suffer and those who are ignorant.\n\nAnd, let us say it, all this is but the beginning. The true question is\nthis: labor cannot be a law without being a right.\n\nWe will not insist upon this point; this is not the proper place for\nthat.\n\nIf nature calls itself Providence, society should call itself foresight.\n\nIntellectual and moral growth is no less indispensable than material\nimprovement. To know is a sacrament, to think is the prime necessity,\ntruth is nourishment as well as grain. A reason which fasts from science\nand wisdom grows thin. Let us enter equal complaint against stomachs and\nminds which do not eat. If there is anything more heart-breaking than\na body perishing for lack of bread, it is a soul which is dying from\nhunger for the light.\n\nThe whole of progress tends in the direction of solution. Some day we\nshall be amazed. As the human race mounts upward, the deep layers emerge\nnaturally from the zone of distress. The obliteration of misery will be\naccomplished by a simple elevation of level.\n\nWe should do wrong were we to doubt this blessed consummation.\n\nThe past is very strong, it is true, at the present moment. It censures.\nThis rejuvenation of a corpse is surprising. Behold, it is walking and\nadvancing. It seems a victor; this dead body is a conqueror. He arrives\nwith his legions, superstitions, with his sword, despotism, with his\nbanner, ignorance; a while ago, he won ten battles. He advances, he\nthreatens, he laughs, he is at our doors. Let us not despair, on our\nside. Let us sell the field on which Hannibal is encamped.\n\nWhat have we to fear, we who believe?\n\nNo such thing as a back-flow of ideas exists any more than there exists\na return of a river on its course.\n\nBut let those who do not desire a future reflect on this matter. When\nthey say \"no\" to progress, it is not the future but themselves that\nthey are condemning. They are giving themselves a sad malady; they are\ninoculating themselves with the past. There is but one way of rejecting\nTo-morrow, and that is to die.\n\nNow, no death, that of the body as late as possible, that of the soul\nnever,--this is what we desire.\n\nYes, the enigma will utter its word, the sphinx will speak, the problem\nwill be solved.\n\nYes, the people, sketched out by the eighteenth century, will be\nfinished by the nineteenth. He who doubts this is an idiot! The future\nblossoming, the near blossoming forth of universal well-being, is a\ndivinely fatal phenomenon.\n\nImmense combined propulsions direct human affairs and conduct them\nwithin a given time to a logical state, that is to say, to a state of\nequilibrium; that is to say, to equity. A force composed of earth and\nheaven results from humanity and governs it; this force is a worker\nof miracles; marvellous issues are no more difficult to it than\nextraordinary vicissitudes. Aided by science, which comes from one man,\nand by the event, which comes from another, it is not greatly alarmed\nby these contradictions in the attitude of problems, which seem\nimpossibilities to the vulgar herd. It is no less skilful at causing a\nsolution to spring forth from the reconciliation of ideas, than a lesson\nfrom the reconciliation of facts, and we may expect anything from that\nmysterious power of progress, which brought the Orient and the Occident\nface to face one fine day, in the depths of a sepulchre, and made the\nimaums converse with Bonaparte in the interior of the Great Pyramid.\n\nIn the meantime, let there be no halt, no hesitation, no pause in the\ngrandiose onward march of minds. Social philosophy consists essentially\nin science and peace. Its object is, and its result must be, to dissolve\nwrath by the study of antagonisms. It examines, it scrutinizes, it\nanalyzes; then it puts together once more, it proceeds by means of\nreduction, discarding all hatred.\n\nMore than once, a society has been seen to give way before the wind\nwhich is let loose upon mankind; history is full of the shipwrecks of\nnations and empires; manners, customs, laws, religions,--and some fine\nday that unknown force, the hurricane, passes by and bears them all\naway. The civilizations of India, of Chaldea, of Persia, of Syria, of\nEgypt, have disappeared one after the other. Why? We know not. What are\nthe causes of these disasters? We do not know. Could these societies\nhave been saved? Was it their fault? Did they persist in the fatal vice\nwhich destroyed them? What is the amount of suicide in these terrible\ndeaths of a nation and a race? Questions to which there exists no reply.\nDarkness enwraps condemned civilizations. They sprung a leak, then they\nsank. We have nothing more to say; and it is with a sort of terror that\nwe look on, at the bottom of that sea which is called the past, behind\nthose colossal waves, at the shipwreck of those immense vessels,\nBabylon, Nineveh, Tarsus, Thebes, Rome, beneath the fearful gusts which\nemerge from all the mouths of the shadows. But shadows are there, and\nlight is here. We are not acquainted with the maladies of these ancient\ncivilizations, we do not know the infirmities of our own. Everywhere\nupon it we have the right of light, we contemplate its beauties, we\nlay bare its defects. Where it is ill, we probe; and the sickness once\ndiagnosed, the study of the cause leads to the discovery of the remedy.\nOur civilization, the work of twenty centuries, is its law and its\nprodigy; it is worth the trouble of saving. It will be saved. It is\nalready much to have solaced it; its enlightenment is yet another point.\nAll the labors of modern social philosophies must converge towards\nthis point. The thinker of to-day has a great duty--to auscultate\ncivilization.\n\nWe repeat, that this auscultation brings encouragement; it is by this\npersistence in encouragement that we wish to conclude these pages, an\naustere interlude in a mournful drama. Beneath the social mortality, we\nfeel human imperishableness. The globe does not perish, because it has\nthese wounds, craters, eruptions, sulphur pits, here and there, nor\nbecause of a volcano which ejects its pus. The maladies of the people do\nnot kill man.\n\nAnd yet, any one who follows the course of social clinics shakes his\nhead at times. The strongest, the tenderest, the most logical have their\nhours of weakness.\n\nWill the future arrive? It seems as though we might almost put\nthis question, when we behold so much terrible darkness. Melancholy\nface-to-face encounter of selfish and wretched. On the part of\nthe selfish, the prejudices, shadows of costly education, appetite\nincreasing through intoxication, a giddiness of prosperity which dulls,\na fear of suffering which, in some, goes as far as an aversion for the\nsuffering, an implacable satisfaction, the I so swollen that it bars the\nsoul; on the side of the wretched covetousness, envy, hatred of seeing\nothers enjoy, the profound impulses of the human beast towards assuaging\nits desires, hearts full of mist, sadness, need, fatality, impure and\nsimple ignorance.\n\nShall we continue to raise our eyes to heaven? is the luminous point\nwhich we distinguish there one of those which vanish? The ideal\nis frightful to behold, thus lost in the depths, small, isolated,\nimperceptible, brilliant, but surrounded by those great, black menaces,\nmonstrously heaped around it; yet no more in danger than a star in the\nmaw of the clouds.\n\n\n\n\nBOOK EIGHTH.--ENCHANTMENTS AND DESOLATIONS\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I--FULL LIGHT\n\nThe reader has probably understood that Eponine, having recognized\nthrough the gate, the inhabitant of that Rue Plumet whither Magnon had\nsent her, had begun by keeping the ruffians away from the Rue Plumet,\nand had then conducted Marius thither, and that, after many days spent\nin ecstasy before that gate, Marius, drawn on by that force which draws\nthe iron to the magnet and a lover towards the stones of which is built\nthe house of her whom he loves, had finally entered Cosette's garden as\nRomeo entered the garden of Juliet. This had even proved easier for him\nthan for Romeo; Romeo was obliged to scale a wall, Marius had only\nto use a little force on one of the bars of the decrepit gate which\nvacillated in its rusty recess, after the fashion of old people's teeth.\nMarius was slender and readily passed through.\n\nAs there was never any one in the street, and as Marius never entered\nthe garden except at night, he ran no risk of being seen.\n\nBeginning with that blessed and holy hour when a kiss betrothed these\ntwo souls, Marius was there every evening. If, at that period of\nher existence, Cosette had fallen in love with a man in the least\nunscrupulous or debauched, she would have been lost; for there are\ngenerous natures which yield themselves, and Cosette was one of them.\nOne of woman's magnanimities is to yield. Love, at the height where it\nis absolute, is complicated with some indescribably celestial blindness\nof modesty. But what dangers you run, O noble souls! Often you give the\nheart, and we take the body. Your heart remains with you, you gaze upon\nit in the gloom with a shudder. Love has no middle course; it either\nruins or it saves. All human destiny lies in this dilemma. This dilemma,\nruin, or safety, is set forth no more inexorably by any fatality than\nby love. Love is life, if it is not death. Cradle; also coffin. The same\nsentiment says \"yes\" and \"no\" in the human heart. Of all the things that\nGod has made, the human heart is the one which sheds the most light,\nalas! and the most darkness.\n\nGod willed that Cosette's love should encounter one of the loves which\nsave.\n\nThroughout the whole of the month of May of that year 1832, there were\nthere, in every night, in that poor, neglected garden, beneath that\nthicket which grew thicker and more fragrant day by day, two beings\ncomposed of all chastity, all innocence, overflowing with all the\nfelicity of heaven, nearer to the archangels than to mankind, pure,\nhonest, intoxicated, radiant, who shone for each other amid the shadows.\nIt seemed to Cosette that Marius had a crown, and to Marius that Cosette\nhad a nimbus. They touched each other, they gazed at each other, they\nclasped each other's hands, they pressed close to each other; but there\nwas a distance which they did not pass. Not that they respected it;\nthey did not know of its existence. Marius was conscious of a barrier,\nCosette's innocence; and Cosette of a support, Marius' loyalty. The\nfirst kiss had also been the last. Marius, since that time, had not gone\nfurther than to touch Cosette's hand, or her kerchief, or a lock of her\nhair, with his lips. For him, Cosette was a perfume and not a woman.\nHe inhaled her. She refused nothing, and he asked nothing. Cosette was\nhappy, and Marius was satisfied. They lived in this ecstatic state which\ncan be described as the dazzling of one soul by another soul. It was\nthe ineffable first embrace of two maiden souls in the ideal. Two swans\nmeeting on the Jungfrau.\n\nAt that hour of love, an hour when voluptuousness is absolutely mute,\nbeneath the omnipotence of ecstasy, Marius, the pure and seraphic\nMarius, would rather have gone to a woman of the town than have raised\nCosette's robe to the height of her ankle. Once, in the moonlight,\nCosette stooped to pick up something on the ground, her bodice fell\napart and permitted a glimpse of the beginning of her throat. Marius\nturned away his eyes.\n\nWhat took place between these two beings? Nothing. They adored each\nother.\n\nAt night, when they were there, that garden seemed a living and a sacred\nspot. All flowers unfolded around them and sent them incense; and they\nopened their souls and scattered them over the flowers. The wanton and\nvigorous vegetation quivered, full of strength and intoxication, around\nthese two innocents, and they uttered words of love which set the trees\nto trembling.\n\nWhat words were these? Breaths. Nothing more. These breaths sufficed to\ntrouble and to touch all nature round about. Magic power which we\nshould find it difficult to understand were we to read in a book these\nconversations which are made to be borne away and dispersed like smoke\nwreaths by the breeze beneath the leaves. Take from those murmurs of two\nlovers that melody which proceeds from the soul and which accompanies\nthem like a lyre, and what remains is nothing more than a shade; you\nsay: \"What! is that all!\" eh! yes, childish prattle, repetitions,\nlaughter at nothing, nonsense, everything that is deepest and most\nsublime in the world! The only things which are worth the trouble of\nsaying and hearing!\n\nThe man who has never heard, the man who has never uttered these\nabsurdities, these paltry remarks, is an imbecile and a malicious\nfellow. Cosette said to Marius:--\n\n\"Dost thou know?--\"\n\n[In all this and athwart this celestial maidenliness, and without either\nof them being able to say how it had come about, they had begun to call\neach other thou.]\n\n\"Dost thou know? My name is Euphrasie.\"\n\n\"Euphrasie? Why, no, thy name is Cosette.\"\n\n\"Oh! Cosette is a very ugly name that was given to me when I was\na little thing. But my real name is Euphrasie. Dost thou like that\nname--Euphrasie?\"\n\n\"Yes. But Cosette is not ugly.\"\n\n\"Do you like it better than Euphrasie?\"\n\n\"Why, yes.\"\n\n\"Then I like it better too. Truly, it is pretty, Cosette. Call me\nCosette.\"\n\nAnd the smile that she added made of this dialogue an idyl worthy of a\ngrove situated in heaven. On another occasion she gazed intently at him\nand exclaimed:--\n\n\"Monsieur, you are handsome, you are good-looking, you are witty, you\nare not at all stupid, you are much more learned than I am, but I bid\nyou defiance with this word: I love you!\"\n\nAnd Marius, in the very heavens, thought he heard a strain sung by a\nstar.\n\nOr she bestowed on him a gentle tap because he coughed, and she said to\nhim:--\n\n\"Don't cough, sir; I will not have people cough on my domain without my\npermission. It's very naughty to cough and to disturb me. I want you to\nbe well, because, in the first place, if you were not well, I should be\nvery unhappy. What should I do then?\"\n\nAnd this was simply divine.\n\nOnce Marius said to Cosette:--\n\n\"Just imagine, I thought at one time that your name was Ursule.\"\n\nThis made both of them laugh the whole evening.\n\nIn the middle of another conversation, he chanced to exclaim:--\n\n\"Oh! One day, at the Luxembourg, I had a good mind to finish breaking\nup a veteran!\" But he stopped short, and went no further. He would have\nbeen obliged to speak to Cosette of her garter, and that was impossible.\nThis bordered on a strange theme, the flesh, before which that immense\nand innocent love recoiled with a sort of sacred fright.\n\nMarius pictured life with Cosette to himself like this, without anything\nelse; to come every evening to the Rue Plumet, to displace the old and\naccommodating bar of the chief-justice's gate, to sit elbow to elbow\non that bench, to gaze through the trees at the scintillation of the\non-coming night, to fit a fold of the knee of his trousers into the\nample fall of Cosette's gown, to caress her thumb-nail, to call her\nthou, to smell of the same flower, one after the other, forever,\nindefinitely. During this time, clouds passed above their heads. Every\ntime that the wind blows it bears with it more of the dreams of men than\nof the clouds of heaven.\n\nThis chaste, almost shy love was not devoid of gallantry, by any means.\nTo pay compliments to the woman whom a man loves is the first method of\nbestowing caresses, and he is half audacious who tries it. A compliment\nis something like a kiss through a veil. Voluptuousness mingles there\nwith its sweet tiny point, while it hides itself. The heart draws back\nbefore voluptuousness only to love the more. Marius' blandishments, all\nsaturated with fancy, were, so to speak, of azure hue. The birds when\nthey fly up yonder, in the direction of the angels, must hear such\nwords. There were mingled with them, nevertheless, life, humanity, all\nthe positiveness of which Marius was capable. It was what is said in\nthe bower, a prelude to what will be said in the chamber; a lyrical\neffusion, strophe and sonnet intermingled, pleasing hyperboles of\ncooing, all the refinements of adoration arranged in a bouquet and\nexhaling a celestial perfume, an ineffable twitter of heart to heart.\n\n\"Oh!\" murmured Marius, \"how beautiful you are! I dare not look at you.\nIt is all over with me when I contemplate you. You are a grace. I know\nnot what is the matter with me. The hem of your gown, when the tip of\nyour shoe peeps from beneath, upsets me. And then, what an enchanted\ngleam when you open your thought even but a little! You talk\nastonishingly good sense. It seems to me at times that you are a\ndream. Speak, I listen, I admire. Oh Cosette! how strange it is and how\ncharming! I am really beside myself. You are adorable, Mademoiselle. I\nstudy your feet with the microscope and your soul with the telescope.\"\n\nAnd Cosette answered:--\n\n\"I have been loving a little more all the time that has passed since\nthis morning.\"\n\nQuestions and replies took care of themselves in this dialogue, which\nalways turned with mutual consent upon love, as the little pith figures\nalways turn on their peg.\n\nCosette's whole person was ingenuousness, ingenuity, transparency,\nwhiteness, candor, radiance. It might have been said of Cosette that she\nwas clear. She produced on those who saw her the sensation of April\nand dawn. There was dew in her eyes. Cosette was a condensation of the\nauroral light in the form of a woman.\n\nIt was quite simple that Marius should admire her, since he adored her.\nBut the truth is, that this little school-girl, fresh from the convent,\ntalked with exquisite penetration and uttered, at times, all sorts of\ntrue and delicate sayings. Her prattle was conversation. She never made\na mistake about anything, and she saw things justly. The woman feels and\nspeaks with the tender instinct of the heart, which is infallible.\n\nNo one understands so well as a woman, how to say things that are, at\nonce, both sweet and deep. Sweetness and depth, they are the whole of\nwoman; in them lies the whole of heaven.\n\nIn this full felicity, tears welled up to their eyes every instant. A\ncrushed lady-bug, a feather fallen from a nest, a branch of hawthorn\nbroken, aroused their pity, and their ecstasy, sweetly mingled with\nmelancholy, seemed to ask nothing better than to weep. The most\nsovereign symptom of love is a tenderness that is, at times, almost\nunbearable.\n\nAnd, in addition to this,--all these contradictions are the lightning\nplay of love,--they were fond of laughing, they laughed readily and with\na delicious freedom, and so familiarly that they sometimes presented the\nair of two boys.\n\nStill, though unknown to hearts intoxicated with purity, nature is\nalways present and will not be forgotten. She is there with her brutal\nand sublime object; and however great may be the innocence of souls, one\nfeels in the most modest private interview, the adorable and mysterious\nshade which separates a couple of lovers from a pair of friends.\n\nThey idolized each other.\n\nThe permanent and the immutable are persistent. People live, they smile,\nthey laugh, they make little grimaces with the tips of their lips, they\ninterlace their fingers, they call each other thou, and that does not\nprevent eternity.\n\nTwo lovers hide themselves in the evening, in the twilight, in the\ninvisible, with the birds, with the roses; they fascinate each other in\nthe darkness with their hearts which they throw into their eyes, they\nmurmur, they whisper, and in the meantime, immense librations of the\nplanets fill the infinite universe.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II--THE BEWILDERMENT OF PERFECT HAPPINESS\n\nThey existed vaguely, frightened at their happiness. They did not notice\nthe cholera which decimated Paris precisely during that very month. They\nhad confided in each other as far as possible, but this had not extended\nmuch further than their names. Marius had told Cosette that he was an\norphan, that his name was Marius Pontmercy, that he was a lawyer, that\nhe lived by writing things for publishers, that his father had been a\ncolonel, that the latter had been a hero, and that he, Marius, was on\nbad terms with his grandfather who was rich. He had also hinted at being\na baron, but this had produced no effect on Cosette. She did not\nknow the meaning of the word. Marius was Marius. On her side, she\nhad confided to him that she had been brought up at the Petit-Picpus\nconvent, that her mother, like his own, was dead, that her father's name\nwas M. Fauchelevent, that he was very good, that he gave a great deal\nto the poor, but that he was poor himself, and that he denied himself\neverything though he denied her nothing.\n\nStrange to say, in the sort of symphony which Marius had lived since he\nhad been in the habit of seeing Cosette, the past, even the most recent\npast, had become so confused and distant to him, that what Cosette told\nhim satisfied him completely. It did not even occur to him to tell her\nabout the nocturnal adventure in the hovel, about Thenardier, about the\nburn, and about the strange attitude and singular flight of her father.\nMarius had momentarily forgotten all this; in the evening he did not\neven know that there had been a morning, what he had done, where he had\nbreakfasted, nor who had spoken to him; he had songs in his ears which\nrendered him deaf to every other thought; he only existed at the hours\nwhen he saw Cosette. Then, as he was in heaven, it was quite natural\nthat he should forget earth. Both bore languidly the indefinable burden\nof immaterial pleasures. Thus lived these somnambulists who are called\nlovers.\n\nAlas! Who is there who has not felt all these things? Why does there\ncome an hour when one emerges from this azure, and why does life go on\nafterwards?\n\nLoving almost takes the place of thinking. Love is an ardent\nforgetfulness of all the rest. Then ask logic of passion if you will.\nThere is no more absolute logical sequence in the human heart than there\nis a perfect geometrical figure in the celestial mechanism. For Cosette\nand Marius nothing existed except Marius and Cosette. The universe\naround them had fallen into a hole. They lived in a golden minute. There\nwas nothing before them, nothing behind. It hardly occurred to Marius\nthat Cosette had a father. His brain was dazzled and obliterated. Of\nwhat did these lovers talk then? We have seen, of the flowers, and\nthe swallows, the setting sun and the rising moon, and all sorts of\nimportant things. They had told each other everything except everything.\nThe everything of lovers is nothing. But the father, the realities, that\nlair, the ruffians, that adventure, to what purpose? And was he very\nsure that this nightmare had actually existed? They were two, and they\nadored each other, and beyond that there was nothing. Nothing else\nexisted. It is probable that this vanishing of hell in our rear is\ninherent to the arrival of paradise. Have we beheld demons? Are there\nany? Have we trembled? Have we suffered? We no longer know. A rosy cloud\nhangs over it.\n\nSo these two beings lived in this manner, high aloft, with all that\nimprobability which is in nature; neither at the nadir nor at the\nzenith, between man and seraphim, above the mire, below the ether, in\nthe clouds; hardly flesh and blood, soul and ecstasy from head to foot;\nalready too sublime to walk the earth, still too heavily charged with\nhumanity to disappear in the blue, suspended like atoms which are\nwaiting to be precipitated; apparently beyond the bounds of destiny;\nignorant of that rut; yesterday, to-day, to-morrow; amazed, rapturous,\nfloating, soaring; at times so light that they could take their flight\nout into the infinite; almost prepared to soar away to all eternity.\nThey slept wide-awake, thus sweetly lulled. Oh! splendid lethargy of the\nreal overwhelmed by the ideal.\n\nSometimes, beautiful as Cosette was, Marius shut his eyes in her\npresence. The best way to look at the soul is through closed eyes.\n\nMarius and Cosette never asked themselves whither this was to lead them.\nThey considered that they had already arrived. It is a strange claim on\nman's part to wish that love should lead to something.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III--THE BEGINNING OF SHADOW\n\nJean Valjean suspected nothing.\n\nCosette, who was rather less dreamy than Marius, was gay, and that\nsufficed for Jean Valjean's happiness. The thoughts which Cosette\ncherished, her tender preoccupations, Marius' image which filled her\nheart, took away nothing from the incomparable purity of her beautiful,\nchaste, and smiling brow. She was at the age when the virgin bears her\nlove as the angel his lily. So Jean Valjean was at ease. And then, when\ntwo lovers have come to an understanding, things always go well; the\nthird party who might disturb their love is kept in a state of perfect\nblindness by a restricted number of precautions which are always the\nsame in the case of all lovers. Thus, Cosette never objected to any of\nJean Valjean's proposals. Did she want to take a walk? \"Yes, dear little\nfather.\" Did she want to stay at home? Very good. Did he wish to pass\nthe evening with Cosette? She was delighted. As he always went to bed at\nten o'clock, Marius did not come to the garden on such occasions until\nafter that hour, when, from the street, he heard Cosette open the long\nglass door on the veranda. Of course, no one ever met Marius in the\ndaytime. Jean Valjean never even dreamed any longer that Marius was in\nexistence. Only once, one morning, he chanced to say to Cosette: \"Why,\nyou have whitewash on your back!\" On the previous evening, Marius, in a\ntransport, had pushed Cosette against the wall.\n\nOld Toussaint, who retired early, thought of nothing but her sleep, and\nwas as ignorant of the whole matter as Jean Valjean.\n\nMarius never set foot in the house. When he was with Cosette, they hid\nthemselves in a recess near the steps, in order that they might neither\nbe seen nor heard from the street, and there they sat, frequently\ncontenting themselves, by way of conversation, with pressing each\nother's hands twenty times a minute as they gazed at the branches of the\ntrees. At such times, a thunderbolt might have fallen thirty paces from\nthem, and they would not have noticed it, so deeply was the revery of\nthe one absorbed and sunk in the revery of the other.\n\nLimpid purity. Hours wholly white; almost all alike. This sort of love\nis a recollection of lily petals and the plumage of the dove.\n\nThe whole extent of the garden lay between them and the street. Every\ntime that Marius entered and left, he carefully adjusted the bar of the\ngate in such a manner that no displacement was visible.\n\nHe usually went away about midnight, and returned to Courfeyrac's\nlodgings. Courfeyrac said to Bahorel:--\n\n\"Would you believe it? Marius comes home nowadays at one o'clock in the\nmorning.\"\n\nBahorel replied:--\n\n\"What do you expect? There's always a petard in a seminary fellow.\"\n\nAt times, Courfeyrac folded his arms, assumed a serious air, and said to\nMarius:--\n\n\"You are getting irregular in your habits, young man.\"\n\nCourfeyrac, being a practical man, did not take in good part this\nreflection of an invisible paradise upon Marius; he was not much in the\nhabit of concealed passions; it made him impatient, and now and then he\ncalled upon Marius to come back to reality.\n\nOne morning, he threw him this admonition:--\n\n\"My dear fellow, you produce upon me the effect of being located in\nthe moon, the realm of dreams, the province of illusions, capital,\nsoap-bubble. Come, be a good boy, what's her name?\"\n\nBut nothing could induce Marius \"to talk.\" They might have torn out his\nnails before one of the two sacred syllables of which that ineffable\nname, Cosette, was composed. True love is as luminous as the dawn and as\nsilent as the tomb. Only, Courfeyrac saw this change in Marius, that his\ntaciturnity was of the beaming order.\n\nDuring this sweet month of May, Marius and Cosette learned to know these\nimmense delights. To dispute and to say you for thou, simply that they\nmight say thou the better afterwards. To talk at great length with very\nminute details, of persons in whom they took not the slightest interest\nin the world; another proof that in that ravishing opera called love,\nthe libretto counts for almost nothing.\n\nFor Marius, to listen to Cosette discussing finery.\n\nFor Cosette, to listen to Marius talk in politics;\n\nTo listen, knee pressed to knee, to the carriages rolling along the Rue\nde Babylone;\n\nTo gaze upon the same planet in space, or at the same glowworm gleaming\nin the grass;\n\nTo hold their peace together; a still greater delight than conversation;\n\nEtc., etc.\n\nIn the meantime, divers complications were approaching.\n\nOne evening, Marius was on his way to the rendezvous, by way of the\nBoulevard des Invalides. He habitually walked with drooping head. As he\nwas on the point of turning the corner of the Rue Plumet, he heard some\none quite close to him say:--\n\n\"Good evening, Monsieur Marius.\"\n\nHe raised his head and recognized Eponine.\n\nThis produced a singular effect upon him. He had not thought of that\ngirl a single time since the day when she had conducted him to the Rue\nPlumet, he had not seen her again, and she had gone completely out of\nhis mind. He had no reasons for anything but gratitude towards her, he\nowed her his happiness, and yet, it was embarrassing to him to meet her.\n\nIt is an error to think that passion, when it is pure and happy, leads\nman to a state of perfection; it simply leads him, as we have noted, to\na state of oblivion. In this situation, man forgets to be bad, but\nhe also forgets to be good. Gratitude, duty, matters essential and\nimportant to be remembered, vanish. At any other time, Marius would have\nbehaved quite differently to Eponine. Absorbed in Cosette, he had not\neven clearly put it to himself that this Eponine was named Eponine\nThenardier, and that she bore the name inscribed in his father's will,\nthat name, for which, but a few months before, he would have so ardently\nsacrificed himself. We show Marius as he was. His father himself was\nfading out of his soul to some extent, under the splendor of his love.\n\nHe replied with some embarrassment:--\n\n\"Ah! so it's you, Eponine?\"\n\n\"Why do you call me you? Have I done anything to you?\"\n\n\"No,\" he answered.\n\nCertainly, he had nothing against her. Far from it. Only, he felt that\nhe could not do otherwise, now that he used thou to Cosette, than say\nyou to Eponine.\n\nAs he remained silent, she exclaimed:--\n\n\"Say--\"\n\nThen she paused. It seemed as though words failed that creature formerly\nso heedless and so bold. She tried to smile and could not. Then she\nresumed:--\n\n\"Well?\"\n\nThen she paused again, and remained with downcast eyes.\n\n\"Good evening, Mr. Marius,\" said she suddenly and abruptly; and away she\nwent.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV--A CAB RUNS IN ENGLISH AND BARKS IN SLANG\n\nThe following day was the 3d of June, 1832, a date which it is necessary\nto indicate on account of the grave events which at that epoch hung on\nthe horizon of Paris in the state of lightning-charged clouds. Marius,\nat nightfall, was pursuing the same road as on the preceding evening,\nwith the same thoughts of delight in his heart, when he caught sight\nof Eponine approaching, through the trees of the boulevard. Two days\nin succession--this was too much. He turned hastily aside, quitted the\nboulevard, changed his course and went to the Rue Plumet through the Rue\nMonsieur.\n\nThis caused Eponine to follow him to the Rue Plumet, a thing which\nshe had not yet done. Up to that time, she had contented herself with\nwatching him on his passage along the boulevard without ever seeking to\nencounter him. It was only on the evening before that she had attempted\nto address him.\n\nSo Eponine followed him, without his suspecting the fact. She saw him\ndisplace the bar and slip into the garden.\n\nShe approached the railing, felt of the bars one after the other, and\nreadily recognized the one which Marius had moved.\n\nShe murmured in a low voice and in gloomy accents:--\n\n\"None of that, Lisette!\"\n\nShe seated herself on the underpinning of the railing, close beside the\nbar, as though she were guarding it. It was precisely at the point where\nthe railing touched the neighboring wall. There was a dim nook there, in\nwhich Eponine was entirely concealed.\n\nShe remained thus for more than an hour, without stirring and without\nbreathing, a prey to her thoughts.\n\nTowards ten o'clock in the evening, one of the two or three persons who\npassed through the Rue Plumet, an old, belated bourgeois who was making\nhaste to escape from this deserted spot of evil repute, as he skirted\nthe garden railings and reached the angle which it made with the wall,\nheard a dull and threatening voice saying:--\n\n\"I'm no longer surprised that he comes here every evening.\"\n\nThe passer-by cast a glance around him, saw no one, dared not peer into\nthe black niche, and was greatly alarmed. He redoubled his pace.\n\nThis passer-by had reason to make haste, for a very few instants later,\nsix men, who were marching separately and at some distance from each\nother, along the wall, and who might have been taken for a gray patrol,\nentered the Rue Plumet.\n\nThe first to arrive at the garden railing halted, and waited for the\nothers; a second later, all six were reunited.\n\nThese men began to talk in a low voice.\n\n\"This is the place,\" said one of them.\n\n\"Is there a cab [dog] in the garden?\" asked another.\n\n\"I don't know. In any case, I have fetched a ball that we'll make him\neat.\"\n\n\"Have you some putty to break the pane with?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"The railing is old,\" interpolated a fifth, who had the voice of a\nventriloquist.\n\n\"So much the better,\" said the second who had spoken. \"It won't screech\nunder the saw, and it won't be hard to cut.\"\n\nThe sixth, who had not yet opened his lips, now began to inspect\nthe gate, as Eponine had done an hour earlier, grasping each bar in\nsuccession, and shaking them cautiously.\n\nThus he came to the bar which Marius had loosened. As he was on the\npoint of grasping this bar, a hand emerged abruptly from the darkness,\nfell upon his arm; he felt himself vigorously thrust aside by a push\nin the middle of his breast, and a hoarse voice said to him, but not\nloudly:--\n\n\"There's a dog.\"\n\nAt the same moment, he perceived a pale girl standing before him.\n\nThe man underwent that shock which the unexpected always brings. He\nbristled up in hideous wise; nothing is so formidable to behold as\nferocious beasts who are uneasy; their terrified air evokes terror.\n\nHe recoiled and stammered:--\n\n\"What jade is this?\"\n\n\"Your daughter.\"\n\nIt was, in fact, Eponine, who had addressed Thenardier.\n\nAt the apparition of Eponine, the other five, that is to say,\nClaquesous, Guelemer, Babet, Brujon, and Montparnasse had noiselessly\ndrawn near, without precipitation, without uttering a word, with the\nsinister slowness peculiar to these men of the night.\n\nSome indescribable but hideous tools were visible in their hands.\nGuelemer held one of those pairs of curved pincers which prowlers call\nfanchons.\n\n\"Ah, see here, what are you about there? What do you want with us? Are\nyou crazy?\" exclaimed Thenardier, as loudly as one can exclaim and still\nspeak low; \"what have you come here to hinder our work for?\"\n\nEponine burst out laughing, and threw herself on his neck.\n\n\"I am here, little father, because I am here. Isn't a person allowed to\nsit on the stones nowadays? It's you who ought not to be here. What\nhave you come here for, since it's a biscuit? I told Magnon so. There's\nnothing to be done here. But embrace me, my good little father! It's a\nlong time since I've seen you! So you're out?\"\n\nThenardier tried to disentangle himself from Eponine's arms, and\ngrumbled:--\n\n\"That's good. You've embraced me. Yes, I'm out. I'm not in. Now, get\naway with you.\"\n\nBut Eponine did not release her hold, and redoubled her caresses.\n\n\"But how did you manage it, little pa? You must have been very clever to\nget out of that. Tell me about it! And my mother? Where is mother? Tell\nme about mamma.\"\n\nThenardier replied:--\n\n\"She's well. I don't know, let me alone, and be off, I tell you.\"\n\n\"I won't go, so there now,\" pouted Eponine like a spoiled child; \"you\nsend me off, and it's four months since I saw you, and I've hardly had\ntime to kiss you.\"\n\nAnd she caught her father round the neck again.\n\n\"Come, now, this is stupid!\" said Babet.\n\n\"Make haste!\" said Guelemer, \"the cops may pass.\"\n\nThe ventriloquist's voice repeated his distich:--\n\n\n     \"Nous n' sommes pas le jour de l'an,\n                              \"This isn't New Year's day\n     A becoter papa, maman.\"\n                               To peck at pa and ma.\"\n\n\nEponine turned to the five ruffians.\n\n\"Why, it's Monsieur Brujon. Good day, Monsieur Babet. Good day,\nMonsieur Claquesous. Don't you know me, Monsieur Guelemer? How goes it,\nMontparnasse?\"\n\n\"Yes, they know you!\" ejaculated Thenardier. \"But good day, good\nevening, sheer off! leave us alone!\"\n\n\"It's the hour for foxes, not for chickens,\" said Montparnasse.\n\n\"You see the job we have on hand here,\" added Babet.\n\nEponine caught Montparnasse's hand.\n\n\"Take care,\" said he, \"you'll cut yourself, I've a knife open.\"\n\n\"My little Montparnasse,\" responded Eponine very gently, \"you must have\nconfidence in people. I am the daughter of my father, perhaps. Monsieur\nBabet, Monsieur Guelemer, I'm the person who was charged to investigate\nthis matter.\"\n\nIt is remarkable that Eponine did not talk slang. That frightful tongue\nhad become impossible to her since she had known Marius.\n\nShe pressed in her hand, small, bony, and feeble as that of a skeleton,\nGuelemer's huge, coarse fingers, and continued:--\n\n\"You know well that I'm no fool. Ordinarily, I am believed. I have\nrendered you service on various occasions. Well, I have made inquiries;\nyou will expose yourselves to no purpose, you see. I swear to you that\nthere is nothing in this house.\"\n\n\"There are lone women,\" said Guelemer.\n\n\"No, the persons have moved away.\"\n\n\"The candles haven't, anyway!\" ejaculated Babet.\n\nAnd he pointed out to Eponine, across the tops of the trees, a light\nwhich was wandering about in the mansard roof of the pavilion. It was\nToussaint, who had stayed up to spread out some linen to dry.\n\nEponine made a final effort.\n\n\"Well,\" said she, \"they're very poor folks, and it's a hovel where there\nisn't a sou.\"\n\n\"Go to the devil!\" cried Thenardier. \"When we've turned the house upside\ndown and put the cellar at the top and the attic below, we'll tell\nyou what there is inside, and whether it's francs or sous or\nhalf-farthings.\"\n\nAnd he pushed her aside with the intention of entering.\n\n\"My good friend, Mr. Montparnasse,\" said Eponine, \"I entreat you, you\nare a good fellow, don't enter.\"\n\n\"Take care, you'll cut yourself,\" replied Montparnasse.\n\nThenardier resumed in his decided tone:--\n\n\"Decamp, my girl, and leave men to their own affairs!\"\n\nEponine released Montparnasse's hand, which she had grasped again, and\nsaid:--\n\n\"So you mean to enter this house?\"\n\n\"Rather!\" grinned the ventriloquist.\n\nThen she set her back against the gate, faced the six ruffians who were\narmed to the teeth, and to whom the night lent the visages of demons,\nand said in a firm, low voice:--\n\n\"Well, I don't mean that you shall.\"\n\nThey halted in amazement. The ventriloquist, however, finished his grin.\nShe went on:--\n\n\"Friends! Listen well. This is not what you want. Now I'm talking. In\nthe first place, if you enter this garden, if you lay a hand on this\ngate, I'll scream, I'll beat on the door, I'll rouse everybody, I'll\nhave the whole six of you seized, I'll call the police.\"\n\n\"She'd do it, too,\" said Thenardier in a low tone to Brujon and the\nventriloquist.\n\nShe shook her head and added:--\n\n\"Beginning with my father!\"\n\nThenardier stepped nearer.\n\n\"Not so close, my good man!\" said she.\n\nHe retreated, growling between his teeth:--\n\n\"Why, what's the matter with her?\"\n\nAnd he added:--\n\n\"Bitch!\"\n\nShe began to laugh in a terrible way:--\n\n\"As you like, but you shall not enter here. I'm not the daughter of\na dog, since I'm the daughter of a wolf. There are six of you, what\nmatters that to me? You are men. Well, I'm a woman. You don't frighten\nme. I tell you that you shan't enter this house, because it doesn't suit\nme. If you approach, I'll bark. I told you, I'm the dog, and I don't\ncare a straw for you. Go your way, you bore me! Go where you please, but\ndon't come here, I forbid it! You can use your knives. I'll use kicks;\nit's all the same to me, come on!\"\n\nShe advanced a pace nearer the ruffians, she was terrible, she burst out\nlaughing:--\n\n\"Pardine! I'm not afraid. I shall be hungry this summer, and I shall be\ncold this winter. Aren't they ridiculous, these ninnies of men, to think\nthey can scare a girl! What! Scare? Oh, yes, much! Because you have\nfinical poppets of mistresses who hide under the bed when you put on a\nbig voice, forsooth! I ain't afraid of anything, that I ain't!\"\n\nShe fastened her intent gaze upon Thenardier and said:--\n\n\"Not even of you, father!\"\n\nThen she continued, as she cast her blood-shot, spectre-like eyes upon\nthe ruffians in turn:--\n\n\"What do I care if I'm picked up to-morrow morning on the pavement of\nthe Rue Plumet, killed by the blows of my father's club, or whether I'm\nfound a year from now in the nets at Saint-Cloud or the Isle of Swans in\nthe midst of rotten old corks and drowned dogs?\"\n\nShe was forced to pause; she was seized by a dry cough, her breath came\nfrom her weak and narrow chest like the death-rattle.\n\nShe resumed:--\n\n\"I have only to cry out, and people will come, and then slap, bang!\nThere are six of you; I represent the whole world.\"\n\nThenardier made a movement towards her.\n\n\"Don't approach!\" she cried.\n\nHe halted, and said gently:--\n\n\"Well, no; I won't approach, but don't speak so loud. So you intend to\nhinder us in our work, my daughter? But we must earn our living all the\nsame. Have you no longer any kind feeling for your father?\"\n\n\"You bother me,\" said Eponine.\n\n\"But we must live, we must eat--\"\n\n\"Burst!\"\n\nSo saying, she seated herself on the underpinning of the fence and\nhummed:--\n\n       \"Mon bras si dodu,            \"My arm so plump,\n        Ma jambe bien faite           My leg well formed,\n        Et le temps perdu.\"           And time wasted.\"\n\n\nShe had set her elbow on her knee and her chin in her hand, and she\nswung her foot with an air of indifference. Her tattered gown permitted\na view of her thin shoulder-blades. The neighboring street lantern\nilluminated her profile and her attitude. Nothing more resolute and more\nsurprising could be seen.\n\nThe six rascals, speechless and gloomy at being held in check by a girl,\nretreated beneath the shadow cast by the lantern, and held counsel with\nfurious and humiliated shrugs.\n\nIn the meantime she stared at them with a stern but peaceful air.\n\n\"There's something the matter with her,\" said Babet. \"A reason. Is she\nin love with the dog? It's a shame to miss this, anyway. Two women, an\nold fellow who lodges in the back-yard, and curtains that ain't so bad\nat the windows. The old cove must be a Jew. I think the job's a good\none.\"\n\n\"Well, go in, then, the rest of you,\" exclaimed Montparnasse. \"Do the\njob. I'll stay here with the girl, and if she fails us--\"\n\nHe flashed the knife, which he held open in his hand, in the light of\nthe lantern.\n\nThenardier said not a word, and seemed ready for whatever the rest\npleased.\n\nBrujon, who was somewhat of an oracle, and who had, as the reader knows,\n\"put up the job,\" had not as yet spoken. He seemed thoughtful. He had\nthe reputation of not sticking at anything, and it was known that he\nhad plundered a police post simply out of bravado. Besides this he made\nverses and songs, which gave him great authority.\n\nBabet interrogated him:--\n\n\"You say nothing, Brujon?\"\n\nBrujon remained silent an instant longer, then he shook his head in\nvarious ways, and finally concluded to speak:--\n\n\"See here; this morning I came across two sparrows fighting, this\nevening I jostled a woman who was quarrelling. All that's bad. Let's\nquit.\"\n\nThey went away.\n\nAs they went, Montparnasse muttered:--\n\n\"Never mind! if they had wanted, I'd have cut her throat.\"\n\nBabet responded\n\n\"I wouldn't. I don't hit a lady.\"\n\nAt the corner of the street they halted and exchanged the following\nenigmatical dialogue in a low tone:--\n\n\"Where shall we go to sleep to-night?\"\n\n\"Under Pantin [Paris].\"\n\n\"Have you the key to the gate, Thenardier?\"\n\n\"Pardi.\"\n\nEponine, who never took her eyes off of them, saw them retreat by the\nroad by which they had come. She rose and began to creep after them\nalong the walls and the houses. She followed them thus as far as the\nboulevard.\n\nThere they parted, and she saw these six men plunge into the gloom,\nwhere they appeared to melt away.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V--THINGS OF THE NIGHT\n\nAfter the departure of the ruffians, the Rue Plumet resumed its\ntranquil, nocturnal aspect. That which had just taken place in this\nstreet would not have astonished a forest. The lofty trees, the copses,\nthe heaths, the branches rudely interlaced, the tall grass, exist in\na sombre manner; the savage swarming there catches glimpses of sudden\napparitions of the invisible; that which is below man distinguishes,\nthrough the mists, that which is beyond man; and the things of which we\nliving beings are ignorant there meet face to face in the night. Nature,\nbristling and wild, takes alarm at certain approaches in which she\nfancies that she feels the supernatural. The forces of the gloom know\neach other, and are strangely balanced by each other. Teeth and claws\nfear what they cannot grasp. Blood-drinking bestiality, voracious\nappetites, hunger in search of prey, the armed instincts of nails\nand jaws which have for source and aim the belly, glare and smell out\nuneasily the impassive spectral forms straying beneath a shroud, erect\nin its vague and shuddering robe, and which seem to them to live with\na dead and terrible life. These brutalities, which are only matter,\nentertain a confused fear of having to deal with the immense obscurity\ncondensed into an unknown being. A black figure barring the way stops\nthe wild beast short. That which emerges from the cemetery intimidates\nand disconcerts that which emerges from the cave; the ferocious fear the\nsinister; wolves recoil when they encounter a ghoul.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI--MARIUS BECOMES PRACTICAL ONCE MORE TO THE EXTENT OF GIVING\nCOSETTE HIS ADDRESS\n\nWhile this sort of a dog with a human face was mounting guard over the\ngate, and while the six ruffians were yielding to a girl, Marius was by\nCosette's side.\n\nNever had the sky been more studded with stars and more charming, the\ntrees more trembling, the odor of the grass more penetrating; never had\nthe birds fallen asleep among the leaves with a sweeter noise; never had\nall the harmonies of universal serenity responded more thoroughly to the\ninward music of love; never had Marius been more captivated, more happy,\nmore ecstatic.\n\nBut he had found Cosette sad; Cosette had been weeping. Her eyes were\nred.\n\nThis was the first cloud in that wonderful dream.\n\nMarius' first word had been: \"What is the matter?\"\n\nAnd she had replied: \"This.\"\n\nThen she had seated herself on the bench near the steps, and while he\ntremblingly took his place beside her, she had continued:--\n\n\"My father told me this morning to hold myself in readiness, because he\nhas business, and we may go away from here.\"\n\nMarius shivered from head to foot.\n\nWhen one is at the end of one's life, to die means to go away; when one\nis at the beginning of it, to go away means to die.\n\nFor the last six weeks, Marius had little by little, slowly, by degrees,\ntaken possession of Cosette each day. As we have already explained, in\nthe case of first love, the soul is taken long before the body; later\non, one takes the body long before the soul; sometimes one does not take\nthe soul at all; the Faublas and the Prudhommes add: \"Because there is\nnone\"; but the sarcasm is, fortunately, a blasphemy. So Marius possessed\nCosette, as spirits possess, but he enveloped her with all his soul, and\nseized her jealously with incredible conviction. He possessed her smile,\nher breath, her perfume, the profound radiance of her blue eyes, the\nsweetness of her skin when he touched her hand, the charming mark which\nshe had on her neck, all her thoughts. Therefore, he possessed all\nCosette's dreams.\n\nHe incessantly gazed at, and he sometimes touched lightly with his\nbreath, the short locks on the nape of her neck, and he declared to\nhimself that there was not one of those short hairs which did not belong\nto him, Marius. He gazed upon and adored the things that she wore, her\nknot of ribbon, her gloves, her sleeves, her shoes, her cuffs, as sacred\nobjects of which he was the master. He dreamed that he was the lord of\nthose pretty shell combs which she wore in her hair, and he even said to\nhimself, in confused and suppressed stammerings of voluptuousness which\ndid not make their way to the light, that there was not a ribbon of her\ngown, not a mesh in her stockings, not a fold in her bodice, which was\nnot his. Beside Cosette he felt himself beside his own property, his\nown thing, his own despot and his slave. It seemed as though they had\nso intermingled their souls, that it would have been impossible to tell\nthem apart had they wished to take them back again.--\"This is mine.\"\n\"No, it is mine.\" \"I assure you that you are mistaken. This is my\nproperty.\" \"What you are taking as your own is myself.\"--Marius was\nsomething that made a part of Cosette, and Cosette was something which\nmade a part of Marius. Marius felt Cosette within him. To have Cosette,\nto possess Cosette, this, to him, was not to be distinguished from\nbreathing. It was in the midst of this faith, of this intoxication, of\nthis virgin possession, unprecedented and absolute, of this sovereignty,\nthat these words: \"We are going away,\" fell suddenly, at a blow, and\nthat the harsh voice of reality cried to him: \"Cosette is not yours!\"\n\nMarius awoke. For six weeks Marius had been living, as we have said,\noutside of life; those words, going away! caused him to re-enter it\nharshly.\n\nHe found not a word to say. Cosette merely felt that his hand was very\ncold. She said to him in her turn: \"What is the matter?\"\n\nHe replied in so low a tone that Cosette hardly heard him:--\n\n\"I did not understand what you said.\"\n\nShe began again:--\n\n\"This morning my father told me to settle all my little affairs and to\nhold myself in readiness, that he would give me his linen to put in a\ntrunk, that he was obliged to go on a journey, that we were to go away,\nthat it is necessary to have a large trunk for me and a small one for\nhim, and that all is to be ready in a week from now, and that we might\ngo to England.\"\n\n\"But this is outrageous!\" exclaimed Marius.\n\nIt is certain, that, at that moment, no abuse of power, no violence, not\none of the abominations of the worst tyrants, no action of Busiris, of\nTiberius, or of Henry VIII., could have equalled this in atrocity,\nin the opinion of Marius; M. Fauchelevent taking his daughter off to\nEngland because he had business there.\n\nHe demanded in a weak voice:--\n\n\"And when do you start?\"\n\n\"He did not say when.\"\n\n\"And when shall you return?\"\n\n\"He did not say when.\"\n\nMarius rose and said coldly:--\n\n\"Cosette, shall you go?\"\n\nCosette turned toward him her beautiful eyes, all filled with anguish,\nand replied in a sort of bewilderment:--\n\n\"Where?\"\n\n\"To England. Shall you go?\"\n\n\"Why do you say you to me?\"\n\n\"I ask you whether you will go?\"\n\n\"What do you expect me to do?\" she said, clasping her hands.\n\n\"So, you will go?\"\n\n\"If my father goes.\"\n\n\"So, you will go?\"\n\nCosette took Marius' hand, and pressed it without replying.\n\n\"Very well,\" said Marius, \"then I will go elsewhere.\"\n\nCosette felt rather than understood the meaning of these words.\nShe turned so pale that her face shone white through the gloom. She\nstammered:--\n\n\"What do you mean?\"\n\nMarius looked at her, then raised his eyes to heaven, and answered:\n\"Nothing.\"\n\nWhen his eyes fell again, he saw Cosette smiling at him. The smile of a\nwoman whom one loves possesses a visible radiance, even at night.\n\n\"How silly we are! Marius, I have an idea.\"\n\n\"What is it?\"\n\n\"If we go away, do you go too! I will tell you where! Come and join me\nwherever I am.\"\n\nMarius was now a thoroughly roused man. He had fallen back into reality.\nHe cried to Cosette:--\n\n\"Go away with you! Are you mad? Why, I should have to have money, and I\nhave none! Go to England? But I am in debt now, I owe, I don't know how\nmuch, more than ten louis to Courfeyrac, one of my friends with whom you\nare not acquainted! I have an old hat which is not worth three francs,\nI have a coat which lacks buttons in front, my shirt is all ragged, my\nelbows are torn, my boots let in the water; for the last six weeks I\nhave not thought about it, and I have not told you about it. You only\nsee me at night, and you give me your love; if you were to see me in the\ndaytime, you would give me a sou! Go to England! Eh! I haven't enough to\npay for a passport!\"\n\nHe threw himself against a tree which was close at hand, erect, his brow\npressed close to the bark, feeling neither the wood which flayed his\nskin, nor the fever which was throbbing in his temples, and there he\nstood motionless, on the point of falling, like the statue of despair.\n\nHe remained a long time thus. One could remain for eternity in such\nabysses. At last he turned round. He heard behind him a faint stifled\nnoise, which was sweet yet sad.\n\nIt was Cosette sobbing.\n\nShe had been weeping for more than two hours beside Marius as he\nmeditated.\n\nHe came to her, fell at her knees, and slowly prostrating himself, he\ntook the tip of her foot which peeped out from beneath her robe, and\nkissed it.\n\nShe let him have his way in silence. There are moments when a woman\naccepts, like a sombre and resigned goddess, the religion of love.\n\n\"Do not weep,\" he said.\n\nShe murmured:--\n\n\"Not when I may be going away, and you cannot come!\"\n\nHe went on:--\n\n\"Do you love me?\"\n\nShe replied, sobbing, by that word from paradise which is never more\ncharming than amid tears:--\n\n\"I adore you!\"\n\nHe continued in a tone which was an indescribable caress:--\n\n\"Do not weep. Tell me, will you do this for me, and cease to weep?\"\n\n\"Do you love me?\" said she.\n\nHe took her hand.\n\n\"Cosette, I have never given my word of honor to any one, because my\nword of honor terrifies me. I feel that my father is by my side. Well, I\ngive you my most sacred word of honor, that if you go away I shall die.\"\n\nIn the tone with which he uttered these words there lay a melancholy so\nsolemn and so tranquil, that Cosette trembled. She felt that chill which\nis produced by a true and gloomy thing as it passes by. The shock made\nher cease weeping.\n\n\"Now, listen,\" said he, \"do not expect me to-morrow.\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"Do not expect me until the day after to-morrow.\"\n\n\"Oh! Why?\"\n\n\"You will see.\"\n\n\"A day without seeing you! But that is impossible!\"\n\n\"Let us sacrifice one day in order to gain our whole lives, perhaps.\"\n\nAnd Marius added in a low tone and in an aside:--\n\n\"He is a man who never changes his habits, and he has never received any\none except in the evening.\"\n\n\"Of what man are you speaking?\" asked Cosette.\n\n\"I? I said nothing.\"\n\n\"What do you hope, then?\"\n\n\"Wait until the day after to-morrow.\"\n\n\"You wish it?\"\n\n\"Yes, Cosette.\"\n\nShe took his head in both her hands, raising herself on tiptoe in order\nto be on a level with him, and tried to read his hope in his eyes.\n\nMarius resumed:--\n\n\"Now that I think of it, you ought to know my address: something might\nhappen, one never knows; I live with that friend named Courfeyrac, Rue\nde la Verrerie, No. 16.\"\n\nHe searched in his pocket, pulled out his penknife, and with the blade\nhe wrote on the plaster of the wall:--\n\n\"16 Rue de la Verrerie.\"\n\nIn the meantime, Cosette had begun to gaze into his eyes once more.\n\n\"Tell me your thought, Marius; you have some idea. Tell it to me. Oh!\ntell me, so that I may pass a pleasant night.\"\n\n\"This is my idea: that it is impossible that God should mean to part us.\nWait; expect me the day after to-morrow.\"\n\n\"What shall I do until then?\" said Cosette. \"You are outside, you go,\nand come! How happy men are! I shall remain entirely alone! Oh! How sad\nI shall be! What is it that you are going to do to-morrow evening? tell\nme.\"\n\n\"I am going to try something.\"\n\n\"Then I will pray to God and I will think of you here, so that you may\nbe successful. I will question you no further, since you do not wish it.\nYou are my master. I shall pass the evening to-morrow in singing that\nmusic from Euryanthe that you love, and that you came one evening to\nlisten to, outside my shutters. But day after to-morrow you will come\nearly. I shall expect you at dusk, at nine o'clock precisely, I warn\nyou. Mon Dieu! how sad it is that the days are so long! On the stroke of\nnine, do you understand, I shall be in the garden.\"\n\n\"And I also.\"\n\nAnd without having uttered it, moved by the same thought, impelled by\nthose electric currents which place lovers in continual communication,\nboth being intoxicated with delight even in their sorrow, they fell into\neach other's arms, without perceiving that their lips met while their\nuplifted eyes, overflowing with rapture and full of tears, gazed upon\nthe stars.\n\nWhen Marius went forth, the street was deserted. This was the moment\nwhen Eponine was following the ruffians to the boulevard.\n\nWhile Marius had been dreaming with his head pressed to the tree, an\nidea had crossed his mind; an idea, alas! that he himself judged to be\nsenseless and impossible. He had come to a desperate decision.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII--THE OLD HEART AND THE YOUNG HEART IN THE PRESENCE OF EACH\nOTHER\n\nAt that epoch, Father Gillenormand was well past his ninety-first\nbirthday. He still lived with Mademoiselle Gillenormand in the Rue des\nFilles-du-Calvaire, No. 6, in the old house which he owned. He was, as\nthe reader will remember, one of those antique old men who await death\nperfectly erect, whom age bears down without bending, and whom even\nsorrow cannot curve.\n\nStill, his daughter had been saying for some time: \"My father is\nsinking.\" He no longer boxed the maids' ears; he no longer thumped\nthe landing-place so vigorously with his cane when Basque was slow in\nopening the door. The Revolution of July had exasperated him for the\nspace of barely six months. He had viewed, almost tranquilly, that\ncoupling of words, in the Moniteur: M. Humblot-Conte, peer of France.\nThe fact is, that the old man was deeply dejected. He did not bend, he\ndid not yield; this was no more a characteristic of his physical than\nof his moral nature, but he felt himself giving way internally. For four\nyears he had been waiting for Marius, with his foot firmly planted, that\nis the exact word, in the conviction that that good-for-nothing young\nscamp would ring at his door some day or other; now he had reached\nthe point, where, at certain gloomy hours, he said to himself, that\nif Marius made him wait much longer--It was not death that was\ninsupportable to him; it was the idea that perhaps he should never see\nMarius again. The idea of never seeing Marius again had never entered\nhis brain until that day; now the thought began to recur to him, and\nit chilled him. Absence, as is always the case in genuine and natural\nsentiments, had only served to augment the grandfather's love for the\nungrateful child, who had gone off like a flash. It is during December\nnights, when the cold stands at ten degrees, that one thinks oftenest of\nthe son.\n\nM. Gillenormand was, or thought himself, above all things, incapable\nof taking a single step, he--the grandfather, towards his grandson; \"I\nwould die rather,\" he said to himself. He did not consider himself\nas the least to blame; but he thought of Marius only with profound\ntenderness, and the mute despair of an elderly, kindly old man who is\nabout to vanish in the dark.\n\nHe began to lose his teeth, which added to his sadness.\n\nM. Gillenormand, without however acknowledging it to himself, for it\nwould have rendered him furious and ashamed, had never loved a mistress\nas he loved Marius.\n\nHe had had placed in his chamber, opposite the head of his bed, so that\nit should be the first thing on which his eyes fell on waking, an\nold portrait of his other daughter, who was dead, Madame Pontmercy,\na portrait which had been taken when she was eighteen. He gazed\nincessantly at that portrait. One day, he happened to say, as he gazed\nupon it:--\n\n\"I think the likeness is strong.\"\n\n\"To my sister?\" inquired Mademoiselle Gillenormand. \"Yes, certainly.\"\n\n\"The old man added:--\n\n\"And to him also.\"\n\nOnce as he sat with his knees pressed together, and his eyes almost\nclosed, in a despondent attitude, his daughter ventured to say to him:--\n\n\"Father, are you as angry with him as ever?\"\n\nShe paused, not daring to proceed further.\n\n\"With whom?\" he demanded.\n\n\"With that poor Marius.\"\n\nHe raised his aged head, laid his withered and emaciated fist on the\ntable, and exclaimed in his most irritated and vibrating tone:--\n\n\"Poor Marius, do you say! That gentleman is a knave, a wretched\nscoundrel, a vain little ingrate, a heartless, soulless, haughty, and\nwicked man!\"\n\nAnd he turned away so that his daughter might not see the tear that\nstood in his eye.\n\nThree days later he broke a silence which had lasted four hours, to say\nto his daughter point-blank:--\n\n\"I had the honor to ask Mademoiselle Gillenormand never to mention him\nto me.\"\n\nAunt Gillenormand renounced every effort, and pronounced this acute\ndiagnosis: \"My father never cared very much for my sister after her\nfolly. It is clear that he detests Marius.\"\n\n\"After her folly\" meant: \"after she had married the colonel.\"\n\nHowever, as the reader has been able to conjecture, Mademoiselle\nGillenormand had failed in her attempt to substitute her favorite, the\nofficer of lancers, for Marius. The substitute, Theodule, had not been a\nsuccess. M. Gillenormand had not accepted the quid pro quo. A vacancy\nin the heart does not accommodate itself to a stop-gap. Theodule, on his\nside, though he scented the inheritance, was disgusted at the task\nof pleasing. The goodman bored the lancer; and the lancer shocked the\ngoodman. Lieutenant Theodule was gay, no doubt, but a chatter-box,\nfrivolous, but vulgar; a high liver, but a frequenter of bad company; he\nhad mistresses, it is true, and he had a great deal to say about them,\nit is true also; but he talked badly. All his good qualities had a\ndefect. M. Gillenormand was worn out with hearing him tell about the\nlove affairs that he had in the vicinity of the barracks in the Rue\nde Babylone. And then, Lieutenant Gillenormand sometimes came in his\nuniform, with the tricolored cockade. This rendered him downright\nintolerable. Finally, Father Gillenormand had said to his daughter:\n\"I've had enough of that Theodule. I haven't much taste for warriors\nin time of peace. Receive him if you choose. I don't know but I prefer\nslashers to fellows that drag their swords. The clash of blades in\nbattle is less dismal, after all, than the clank of the scabbard on\nthe pavement. And then, throwing out your chest like a bully and\nlacing yourself like a girl, with stays under your cuirass, is doubly\nridiculous. When one is a veritable man, one holds equally aloof\nfrom swagger and from affected airs. He is neither a blusterer nor a\nfinnicky-hearted man. Keep your Theodule for yourself.\"\n\nIt was in vain that his daughter said to him: \"But he is your\ngrandnephew, nevertheless,\"--it turned out that M. Gillenormand, who\nwas a grandfather to the very finger-tips, was not in the least a\ngrand-uncle.\n\nIn fact, as he had good sense, and as he had compared the two, Theodule\nhad only served to make him regret Marius all the more.\n\nOne evening,--it was the 24th of June, which did not prevent Father\nGillenormand having a rousing fire on the hearth,--he had dismissed his\ndaughter, who was sewing in a neighboring apartment. He was alone in\nhis chamber, amid its pastoral scenes, with his feet propped on the\nandirons, half enveloped in his huge screen of coromandel lacquer, with\nits nine leaves, with his elbow resting on a table where burned two\ncandles under a green shade, engulfed in his tapestry armchair, and in\nhis hand a book which he was not reading. He was dressed, according\nto his wont, like an incroyable, and resembled an antique portrait by\nGarat. This would have made people run after him in the street, had not\nhis daughter covered him up, whenever he went out, in a vast bishop's\nwadded cloak, which concealed his attire. At home, he never wore a\ndressing gown, except when he rose and retired. \"It gives one a look of\nage,\" said he.\n\nFather Gillenormand was thinking of Marius lovingly and bitterly; and,\nas usual, bitterness predominated. His tenderness once soured always\nended by boiling and turning to indignation. He had reached the point\nwhere a man tries to make up his mind and to accept that which rends his\nheart. He was explaining to himself that there was no longer any reason\nwhy Marius should return, that if he intended to return, he should\nhave done it long ago, that he must renounce the idea. He was trying to\naccustom himself to the thought that all was over, and that he should\ndie without having beheld \"that gentleman\" again. But his whole nature\nrevolted; his aged paternity would not consent to this. \"Well!\" said\nhe,--this was his doleful refrain,--\"he will not return!\" His bald head\nhad fallen upon his breast, and he fixed a melancholy and irritated gaze\nupon the ashes on his hearth.\n\nIn the very midst of his revery, his old servant Basque entered, and\ninquired:--\n\n\"Can Monsieur receive M. Marius?\"\n\nThe old man sat up erect, pallid, and like a corpse which rises under\nthe influence of a galvanic shock. All his blood had retreated to his\nheart. He stammered:--\n\n\"M. Marius what?\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" replied Basque, intimidated and put out of countenance\nby his master's air; \"I have not seen him. Nicolette came in and said to\nme: 'There's a young man here; say that it is M. Marius.'\"\n\nFather Gillenormand stammered in a low voice:--\n\n\"Show him in.\"\n\nAnd he remained in the same attitude, with shaking head, and his eyes\nfixed on the door. It opened once more. A young man entered. It was\nMarius.\n\nMarius halted at the door, as though waiting to be bidden to enter.\n\nHis almost squalid attire was not perceptible in the obscurity caused by\nthe shade. Nothing could be seen but his calm, grave, but strangely sad\nface.\n\nIt was several minutes before Father Gillenormand, dulled with amazement\nand joy, could see anything except a brightness as when one is in the\npresence of an apparition. He was on the point of swooning; he saw\nMarius through a dazzling light. It certainly was he, it certainly was\nMarius.\n\nAt last! After the lapse of four years! He grasped him entire, so to\nspeak, in a single glance. He found him noble, handsome, distinguished,\nwell-grown, a complete man, with a suitable mien and a charming air. He\nfelt a desire to open his arms, to call him, to fling himself forward;\nhis heart melted with rapture, affectionate words swelled and overflowed\nhis breast; at length all his tenderness came to the light and reached\nhis lips, and, by a contrast which constituted the very foundation of\nhis nature, what came forth was harshness. He said abruptly:--\n\n\"What have you come here for?\"\n\nMarius replied with embarrassment:--\n\n\"Monsieur--\"\n\nM. Gillenormand would have liked to have Marius throw himself into his\narms. He was displeased with Marius and with himself. He was conscious\nthat he was brusque, and that Marius was cold. It caused the goodman\nunendurable and irritating anxiety to feel so tender and forlorn\nwithin, and only to be able to be hard outside. Bitterness returned. He\ninterrupted Marius in a peevish tone:--\n\n\"Then why did you come?\"\n\nThat \"then\" signified: If you do not come to embrace me. Marius looked\nat his grandfather, whose pallor gave him a face of marble.\n\n\"Monsieur--\"\n\n\"Have you come to beg my pardon? Do you acknowledge your faults?\"\n\nHe thought he was putting Marius on the right road, and that \"the child\"\nwould yield. Marius shivered; it was the denial of his father that was\nrequired of him; he dropped his eyes and replied:--\n\n\"No, sir.\"\n\n\"Then,\" exclaimed the old man impetuously, with a grief that was\npoignant and full of wrath, \"what do you want of me?\"\n\nMarius clasped his hands, advanced a step, and said in a feeble and\ntrembling voice:--\n\n\"Sir, have pity on me.\"\n\nThese words touched M. Gillenormand; uttered a little sooner, they would\nhave rendered him tender, but they came too late. The grandfather rose;\nhe supported himself with both hands on his cane; his lips were white,\nhis brow wavered, but his lofty form towered above Marius as he bowed.\n\n\"Pity on you, sir! It is youth demanding pity of the old man of\nninety-one! You are entering into life, I am leaving it; you go to the\nplay, to balls, to the cafe, to the billiard-hall; you have wit, you\nplease the women, you are a handsome fellow; as for me, I spit on my\nbrands in the heart of summer; you are rich with the only riches that\nare really such, I possess all the poverty of age; infirmity, isolation!\nYou have your thirty-two teeth, a good digestion, bright eyes, strength,\nappetite, health, gayety, a forest of black hair; I have no longer even\nwhite hair, I have lost my teeth, I am losing my legs, I am losing my\nmemory; there are three names of streets that I confound incessantly,\nthe Rue Charlot, the Rue du Chaume, and the Rue Saint-Claude, that\nis what I have come to; you have before you the whole future, full of\nsunshine, and I am beginning to lose my sight, so far am I advancing\ninto the night; you are in love, that is a matter of course, I am\nbeloved by no one in all the world; and you ask pity of me! Parbleu!\nMoliere forgot that. If that is the way you jest at the courthouse,\nMessieurs the lawyers, I sincerely compliment you. You are droll.\"\n\nAnd the octogenarian went on in a grave and angry voice:--\n\n\"Come, now, what do you want of me?\"\n\n\"Sir,\" said Marius, \"I know that my presence is displeasing to you, but\nI have come merely to ask one thing of you, and then I shall go away\nimmediately.\"\n\n\"You are a fool!\" said the old man. \"Who said that you were to go away?\"\n\nThis was the translation of the tender words which lay at the bottom of\nhis heart:--\n\n\"Ask my pardon! Throw yourself on my neck!\"\n\nM. Gillenormand felt that Marius would leave him in a few moments, that\nhis harsh reception had repelled the lad, that his hardness was driving\nhim away; he said all this to himself, and it augmented his grief; and\nas his grief was straightway converted into wrath, it increased his\nharshness. He would have liked to have Marius understand, and Marius did\nnot understand, which made the goodman furious.\n\nHe began again:--\n\n\"What! you deserted me, your grandfather, you left my house to go no\none knows whither, you drove your aunt to despair, you went off, it is\neasily guessed, to lead a bachelor life; it's more convenient, to play\nthe dandy, to come in at all hours, to amuse yourself; you have given me\nno signs of life, you have contracted debts without even telling me to\npay them, you have become a smasher of windows and a blusterer, and, at\nthe end of four years, you come to me, and that is all you have to say\nto me!\"\n\nThis violent fashion of driving a grandson to tenderness was productive\nonly of silence on the part of Marius. M. Gillenormand folded his arms;\na gesture which with him was peculiarly imperious, and apostrophized\nMarius bitterly:--\n\n\"Let us make an end of this. You have come to ask something of me, you\nsay? Well, what? What is it? Speak!\"\n\n\"Sir,\" said Marius, with the look of a man who feels that he is falling\nover a precipice, \"I have come to ask your permission to marry.\"\n\nM. Gillenormand rang the bell. Basque opened the door half-way.\n\n\"Call my daughter.\"\n\nA second later, the door was opened once more, Mademoiselle Gillenormand\ndid not enter, but showed herself; Marius was standing, mute, with\npendant arms and the face of a criminal; M. Gillenormand was pacing back\nand forth in the room. He turned to his daughter and said to her:--\n\n\"Nothing. It is Monsieur Marius. Say good day to him. Monsieur wishes to\nmarry. That's all. Go away.\"\n\nThe curt, hoarse sound of the old man's voice announced a strange degree\nof excitement. The aunt gazed at Marius with a frightened air, hardly\nappeared to recognize him, did not allow a gesture or a syllable to\nescape her, and disappeared at her father's breath more swiftly than a\nstraw before the hurricane.\n\nIn the meantime, Father Gillenormand had returned and placed his back\nagainst the chimney-piece once more.\n\n\"You marry! At one and twenty! You have arranged that! You have only\na permission to ask! a formality. Sit down, sir. Well, you have had a\nrevolution since I had the honor to see you last. The Jacobins got the\nupper hand. You must have been delighted. Are you not a Republican since\nyou are a Baron? You can make that agree. The Republic makes a good\nsauce for the barony. Are you one of those decorated by July? Have you\ntaken the Louvre at all, sir? Quite near here, in the Rue Saint-Antoine,\nopposite the Rue des Nonamdieres, there is a cannon-ball incrusted in\nthe wall of the third story of a house with this inscription: 'July\n28th, 1830.' Go take a look at that. It produces a good effect. Ah!\nthose friends of yours do pretty things. By the way, aren't they\nerecting a fountain in the place of the monument of M. le Duc de Berry?\nSo you want to marry? Whom? Can one inquire without indiscretion?\"\n\nHe paused, and, before Marius had time to answer, he added violently:--\n\n\"Come now, you have a profession? A fortune made? How much do you earn\nat your trade of lawyer?\"\n\n\"Nothing,\" said Marius, with a sort of firmness and resolution that was\nalmost fierce.\n\n\"Nothing? Then all that you have to live upon is the twelve hundred\nlivres that I allow you?\"\n\nMarius did not reply. M. Gillenormand continued:--\n\n\"Then I understand the girl is rich?\"\n\n\"As rich as I am.\"\n\n\"What! No dowry?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Expectations?\"\n\n\"I think not.\"\n\n\"Utterly naked! What's the father?\"\n\n\"I don't know.\"\n\n\"And what's her name?\"\n\n\"Mademoiselle Fauchelevent.\"\n\n\"Fauchewhat?\"\n\n\"Fauchelevent.\"\n\n\"Pttt!\" ejaculated the old gentleman.\n\n\"Sir!\" exclaimed Marius.\n\nM. Gillenormand interrupted him with the tone of a man who is speaking\nto himself:--\n\n\"That's right, one and twenty years of age, no profession, twelve\nhundred livres a year, Madame la Baronne de Pontmercy will go and\npurchase a couple of sous' worth of parsley from the fruiterer.\"\n\n\"Sir,\" repeated Marius, in the despair at the last hope, which was\nvanishing, \"I entreat you! I conjure you in the name of Heaven, with\nclasped hands, sir, I throw myself at your feet, permit me to marry\nher!\"\n\nThe old man burst into a shout of strident and mournful laughter,\ncoughing and laughing at the same time.\n\n\"Ah! ah! ah! You said to yourself: 'Pardine! I'll go hunt up that old\nblockhead, that absurd numskull! What a shame that I'm not twenty-five!\nHow I'd treat him to a nice respectful summons! How nicely I'd get along\nwithout him! It's nothing to me, I'd say to him: \"You're only too happy\nto see me, you old idiot, I want to marry, I desire to wed Mamselle\nNo-matter-whom, daughter of Monsieur No-matter-what, I have no shoes,\nshe has no chemise, that just suits; I want to throw my career, my\nfuture, my youth, my life to the dogs; I wish to take a plunge into\nwretchedness with a woman around my neck, that's an idea, and you must\nconsent to it!\" and the old fossil will consent.' Go, my lad, do as\nyou like, attach your paving-stone, marry your Pousselevent, your\nCoupelevent--Never, sir, never!\"\n\n\"Father--\"\n\n\"Never!\"\n\nAt the tone in which that \"never\" was uttered, Marius lost all hope. He\ntraversed the chamber with slow steps, with bowed head, tottering and\nmore like a dying man than like one merely taking his departure. M.\nGillenormand followed him with his eyes, and at the moment when the\ndoor opened, and Marius was on the point of going out, he advanced four\npaces, with the senile vivacity of impetuous and spoiled old gentlemen,\nseized Marius by the collar, brought him back energetically into the\nroom, flung him into an armchair and said to him:--\n\n\"Tell me all about it!\"\n\n\"It was that single word \"father\" which had effected this revolution.\n\nMarius stared at him in bewilderment. M. Gillenormand's mobile face was\nno longer expressive of anything but rough and ineffable good-nature.\nThe grandsire had given way before the grandfather.\n\n\"Come, see here, speak, tell me about your love affairs, jabber, tell me\neverything! Sapristi! how stupid young folks are!\"\n\n\"Father--\" repeated Marius.\n\nThe old man's entire countenance lighted up with indescribable radiance.\n\n\"Yes, that's right, call me father, and you'll see!\"\n\nThere was now something so kind, so gentle, so openhearted, and so\npaternal in this brusqueness, that Marius, in the sudden transition from\ndiscouragement to hope, was stunned and intoxicated by it, as it were.\nHe was seated near the table, the light from the candles brought out\nthe dilapidation of his costume, which Father Gillenormand regarded with\namazement.\n\n\"Well, father--\" said Marius.\n\n\"Ah, by the way,\" interrupted M. Gillenormand, \"you really have not a\npenny then? You are dressed like a pickpocket.\"\n\nHe rummaged in a drawer, drew forth a purse, which he laid on the table:\n\"Here are a hundred louis, buy yourself a hat.\"\n\n\"Father,\" pursued Marius, \"my good father, if you only knew! I love her.\nYou cannot imagine it; the first time I saw her was at the Luxembourg,\nshe came there; in the beginning, I did not pay much heed to her, and\nthen, I don't know how it came about, I fell in love with her. Oh! how\nunhappy that made me! Now, at last, I see her every day, at her own\nhome, her father does not know it, just fancy, they are going away, it\nis in the garden that we meet, in the evening, her father means to take\nher to England, then I said to myself: 'I'll go and see my grandfather\nand tell him all about the affair. I should go mad first, I should die,\nI should fall ill, I should throw myself into the water. I absolutely\nmust marry her, since I should go mad otherwise.' This is the whole\ntruth, and I do not think that I have omitted anything. She lives in a\ngarden with an iron fence, in the Rue Plumet. It is in the neighborhood\nof the Invalides.\"\n\nFather Gillenormand had seated himself, with a beaming countenance,\nbeside Marius. As he listened to him and drank in the sound of his\nvoice, he enjoyed at the same time a protracted pinch of snuff. At\nthe words \"Rue Plumet\" he interrupted his inhalation and allowed the\nremainder of his snuff to fall upon his knees.\n\n\"The Rue Plumet, the Rue Plumet, did you say?--Let us see!--Are there\nnot barracks in that vicinity?--Why, yes, that's it. Your cousin\nTheodule has spoken to me about it. The lancer, the officer. A gay girl,\nmy good friend, a gay girl!--Pardieu, yes, the Rue Plumet. It is what\nused to be called the Rue Blomet.--It all comes back to me now. I have\nheard of that little girl of the iron railing in the Rue Plumet. In a\ngarden, a Pamela. Your taste is not bad. She is said to be a very tidy\ncreature. Between ourselves, I think that simpleton of a lancer has been\ncourting her a bit. I don't know where he did it. However, that's not\nto the purpose. Besides, he is not to be believed. He brags, Marius! I\nthink it quite proper that a young man like you should be in love. It's\nthe right thing at your age. I like you better as a lover than as a\nJacobin. I like you better in love with a petticoat, sapristi! with\ntwenty petticoats, than with M. de Robespierre. For my part, I will do\nmyself the justice to say, that in the line of sans-culottes, I have\nnever loved any one but women. Pretty girls are pretty girls, the deuce!\nThere's no objection to that. As for the little one, she receives you\nwithout her father's knowledge. That's in the established order of\nthings. I have had adventures of that same sort myself. More than one.\nDo you know what is done then? One does not take the matter ferociously;\none does not precipitate himself into the tragic; one does not make\none's mind to marriage and M. le Maire with his scarf. One simply\nbehaves like a fellow of spirit. One shows good sense. Slip along,\nmortals; don't marry. You come and look up your grandfather, who is a\ngood-natured fellow at bottom, and who always has a few rolls of louis\nin an old drawer; you say to him: 'See here, grandfather.' And the\ngrandfather says: 'That's a simple matter. Youth must amuse itself, and\nold age must wear out. I have been young, you will be old. Come, my boy,\nyou shall pass it on to your grandson. Here are two hundred pistoles.\nAmuse yourself, deuce take it!' Nothing better! That's the way the\naffair should be treated. You don't marry, but that does no harm. You\nunderstand me?\"\n\nMarius, petrified and incapable of uttering a syllable, made a sign with\nhis head that he did not.\n\nThe old man burst out laughing, winked his aged eye, gave him a slap on\nthe knee, stared him full in the face with a mysterious and beaming air,\nand said to him, with the tenderest of shrugs of the shoulder:--\n\n\"Booby! make her your mistress.\"\n\nMarius turned pale. He had understood nothing of what his grandfather\nhad just said. This twaddle about the Rue Blomet, Pamela, the barracks,\nthe lancer, had passed before Marius like a dissolving view. Nothing of\nall that could bear any reference to Cosette, who was a lily. The good\nman was wandering in his mind. But this wandering terminated in words\nwhich Marius did understand, and which were a mortal insult to Cosette.\nThose words, \"make her your mistress,\" entered the heart of the strict\nyoung man like a sword.\n\nHe rose, picked up his hat which lay on the floor, and walked to the\ndoor with a firm, assured step. There he turned round, bowed deeply to\nhis grandfather, raised his head erect again, and said:--\n\n\"Five years ago you insulted my father; to-day you have insulted my\nwife. I ask nothing more of you, sir. Farewell.\"\n\nFather Gillenormand, utterly confounded, opened his mouth, extended his\narms, tried to rise, and before he could utter a word, the door closed\nonce more, and Marius had disappeared.\n\nThe old man remained for several minutes motionless and as though\nstruck by lightning, without the power to speak or breathe, as though\na clenched fist grasped his throat. At last he tore himself from his\narm-chair, ran, so far as a man can run at ninety-one, to the door,\nopened it, and cried:--\n\n\"Help! Help!\"\n\nHis daughter made her appearance, then the domestics. He began again,\nwith a pitiful rattle: \"Run after him! Bring him back! What have I done\nto him? He is mad! He is going away! Ah! my God! Ah! my God! This time\nhe will not come back!\"\n\nHe went to the window which looked out on the street, threw it open with\nhis aged and palsied hands, leaned out more than half-way, while Basque\nand Nicolette held him behind, and shouted:--\n\n\"Marius! Marius! Marius! Marius!\"\n\nBut Marius could no longer hear him, for at that moment he was turning\nthe corner of the Rue Saint-Louis.\n\nThe octogenarian raised his hands to his temples two or three times\nwith an expression of anguish, recoiled tottering, and fell back into an\narm-chair, pulseless, voiceless, tearless, with quivering head and lips\nwhich moved with a stupid air, with nothing in his eyes and nothing\nany longer in his heart except a gloomy and profound something which\nresembled night.\n\n\n\n\nBOOK NINTH.--WHITHER ARE THEY GOING?\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I--JEAN VALJEAN\n\nThat same day, towards four o'clock in the afternoon, Jean Valjean was\nsitting alone on the back side of one of the most solitary slopes in the\nChamp-de-Mars. Either from prudence, or from a desire to meditate, or\nsimply in consequence of one of those insensible changes of habit which\ngradually introduce themselves into the existence of every one, he now\nrarely went out with Cosette. He had on his workman's waistcoat,\nand trousers of gray linen; and his long-visored cap concealed his\ncountenance.\n\nHe was calm and happy now beside Cosette; that which had, for a time,\nalarmed and troubled him had been dissipated; but for the last week or\ntwo, anxieties of another nature had come up. One day, while walking\non the boulevard, he had caught sight of Thenardier; thanks to his\ndisguise, Thenardier had not recognized him; but since that day, Jean\nValjean had seen him repeatedly, and he was now certain that Thenardier\nwas prowling about in their neighborhood.\n\nThis had been sufficient to make him come to a decision.\n\nMoreover, Paris was not tranquil: political troubles presented this\ninconvenient feature, for any one who had anything to conceal in his\nlife, that the police had grown very uneasy and very suspicious, and\nthat while seeking to ferret out a man like Pepin or Morey, they might\nvery readily discover a man like Jean Valjean.\n\nJean Valjean had made up his mind to quit Paris, and even France, and go\nover to England.\n\nHe had warned Cosette. He wished to set out before the end of the week.\n\nHe had seated himself on the slope in the Champ-de-Mars, turning over\nall sorts of thoughts in his mind,--Thenardier, the police, the journey,\nand the difficulty of procuring a passport.\n\nHe was troubled from all these points of view.\n\nLast of all, an inexplicable circumstance which had just attracted his\nattention, and from which he had not yet recovered, had added to his\nstate of alarm.\n\nOn the morning of that very day, when he alone of the household was\nstirring, while strolling in the garden before Cosette's shutters\nwere open, he had suddenly perceived on the wall, the following line,\nengraved, probably with a nail:--\n\n16 Rue de la Verrerie.\n\nThis was perfectly fresh, the grooves in the ancient black mortar were\nwhite, a tuft of nettles at the foot of the wall was powdered with the\nfine, fresh plaster.\n\nThis had probably been written on the preceding night.\n\nWhat was this? A signal for others? A warning for himself?\n\nIn any case, it was evident that the garden had been violated, and that\nstrangers had made their way into it.\n\nHe recalled the odd incidents which had already alarmed the household.\n\nHis mind was now filling in this canvas.\n\nHe took good care not to speak to Cosette of the line written on the\nwall, for fear of alarming her.\n\nIn the midst of his preoccupations, he perceived, from a shadow cast by\nthe sun, that some one had halted on the crest of the slope immediately\nbehind him.\n\nHe was on the point of turning round, when a paper folded in four fell\nupon his knees as though a hand had dropped it over his head.\n\nHe took the paper, unfolded it, and read these words written in large\ncharacters, with a pencil:--\n\n\"MOVE AWAY FROM YOUR HOUSE.\"\n\nJean Valjean sprang hastily to his feet; there was no one on the slope;\nhe gazed all around him and perceived a creature larger than a\nchild, not so large as a man, clad in a gray blouse and trousers of\ndust-colored cotton velvet, who was jumping over the parapet and who\nslipped into the moat of the Champde-Mars.\n\nJean Valjean returned home at once, in a very thoughtful mood.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II--MARIUS\n\nMarius had left M. Gillenormand in despair. He had entered the house\nwith very little hope, and quitted it with immense despair.\n\nHowever, and those who have observed the depths of the human heart will\nunderstand this, the officer, the lancer, the ninny, Cousin Theodule,\nhad left no trace in his mind. Not the slightest. The dramatic poet\nmight, apparently, expect some complications from this revelation made\npoint-blank by the grandfather to the grandson. But what the drama would\ngain thereby, truth would lose. Marius was at an age when one believes\nnothing in the line of evil; later on comes the age when one believes\neverything. Suspicions are nothing else than wrinkles. Early youth\nhas none of them. That which overwhelmed Othello glides innocuous over\nCandide. Suspect Cosette! There are hosts of crimes which Marius could\nsooner have committed.\n\nHe began to wander about the streets, the resource of those who suffer.\nHe thought of nothing, so far as he could afterwards remember. At two\no'clock in the morning he returned to Courfeyrac's quarters and flung\nhimself, without undressing, on his mattress. The sun was shining\nbrightly when he sank into that frightful leaden slumber which permits\nideas to go and come in the brain. When he awoke, he saw Courfeyrac,\nEnjolras, Feuilly, and Combeferre standing in the room with their hats\non and all ready to go out.\n\nCourfeyrac said to him:--\n\n\"Are you coming to General Lamarque's funeral?\"\n\nIt seemed to him that Courfeyrac was speaking Chinese.\n\nHe went out some time after them. He put in his pocket the pistols which\nJavert had given him at the time of the adventure on the 3d of February,\nand which had remained in his hands. These pistols were still loaded. It\nwould be difficult to say what vague thought he had in his mind when he\ntook them with him.\n\nAll day long he prowled about, without knowing where he was going; it\nrained at times, he did not perceive it; for his dinner, he purchased a\npenny roll at a baker's, put it in his pocket and forgot it. It appears\nthat he took a bath in the Seine without being aware of it. There are\nmoments when a man has a furnace within his skull. Marius was passing\nthrough one of those moments. He no longer hoped for anything; this\nstep he had taken since the preceding evening. He waited for night with\nfeverish impatience, he had but one idea clearly before his mind;--this\nwas, that at nine o'clock he should see Cosette. This last happiness\nnow constituted his whole future; after that, gloom. At intervals, as\nhe roamed through the most deserted boulevards, it seemed to him that he\nheard strange noises in Paris. He thrust his head out of his revery and\nsaid: \"Is there fighting on hand?\"\n\nAt nightfall, at nine o'clock precisely, as he had promised Cosette,\nhe was in the Rue Plumet. When he approached the grating he forgot\neverything. It was forty-eight hours since he had seen Cosette; he was\nabout to behold her once more; every other thought was effaced, and\nhe felt only a profound and unheard-of joy. Those minutes in which one\nlives centuries always have this sovereign and wonderful property, that\nat the moment when they are passing they fill the heart completely.\n\nMarius displaced the bar, and rushed headlong into the garden. Cosette\nwas not at the spot where she ordinarily waited for him. He traversed\nthe thicket, and approached the recess near the flight of steps: \"She\nis waiting for me there,\" said he. Cosette was not there. He raised his\neyes, and saw that the shutters of the house were closed. He made the\ntour of the garden, the garden was deserted. Then he returned to\nthe house, and, rendered senseless by love, intoxicated, terrified,\nexasperated with grief and uneasiness, like a master who returns home at\nan evil hour, he tapped on the shutters. He knocked and knocked again,\nat the risk of seeing the window open, and her father's gloomy face\nmake its appearance, and demand: \"What do you want?\" This was nothing in\ncomparison with what he dimly caught a glimpse of. When he had rapped,\nhe lifted up his voice and called Cosette.--\"Cosette!\" he cried;\n\"Cosette!\" he repeated imperiously. There was no reply. All was over. No\none in the garden; no one in the house.\n\nMarius fixed his despairing eyes on that dismal house, which was as\nblack and as silent as a tomb and far more empty. He gazed at the stone\nseat on which he had passed so many adorable hours with Cosette. Then he\nseated himself on the flight of steps, his heart filled with sweetness\nand resolution, he blessed his love in the depths of his thought, and\nhe said to himself that, since Cosette was gone, all that there was left\nfor him was to die.\n\nAll at once he heard a voice which seemed to proceed from the street,\nand which was calling to him through the trees:--\n\n\"Mr. Marius!\"\n\nHe started to his feet.\n\n\"Hey?\" said he.\n\n\"Mr. Marius, are you there?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Mr. Marius,\" went on the voice, \"your friends are waiting for you at\nthe barricade of the Rue de la Chanvrerie.\"\n\nThis voice was not wholly unfamiliar to him. It resembled the hoarse,\nrough voice of Eponine. Marius hastened to the gate, thrust aside the\nmovable bar, passed his head through the aperture, and saw some one who\nappeared to him to be a young man, disappearing at a run into the gloom.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III--M. MABEUF\n\nJean Valjean's purse was of no use to M. Mabeuf. M. Mabeuf, in his\nvenerable, infantile austerity, had not accepted the gift of the stars;\nhe had not admitted that a star could coin itself into louis d'or. He\nhad not divined that what had fallen from heaven had come from Gavroche.\nHe had taken the purse to the police commissioner of the quarter, as\na lost article placed by the finder at the disposal of claimants. The\npurse was actually lost. It is unnecessary to say that no one claimed\nit, and that it did not succor M. Mabeuf.\n\nMoreover, M. Mabeuf had continued his downward course.\n\nHis experiments on indigo had been no more successful in the Jardin des\nPlantes than in his garden at Austerlitz. The year before he had owed\nhis housekeeper's wages; now, as we have seen, he owed three quarters\nof his rent. The pawnshop had sold the plates of his Flora after the\nexpiration of thirteen months. Some coppersmith had made stewpans of\nthem. His copper plates gone, and being unable to complete even the\nincomplete copies of his Flora which were in his possession, he had\ndisposed of the text, at a miserable price, as waste paper, to a\nsecond-hand bookseller. Nothing now remained to him of his life's work.\nHe set to work to eat up the money for these copies. When he saw that\nthis wretched resource was becoming exhausted, he gave up his garden\nand allowed it to run to waste. Before this, a long time before, he had\ngiven up his two eggs and the morsel of beef which he ate from time\nto time. He dined on bread and potatoes. He had sold the last of his\nfurniture, then all duplicates of his bedding, his clothing and his\nblankets, then his herbariums and prints; but he still retained his most\nprecious books, many of which were of the greatest rarity, among others,\nLes Quadrins Historiques de la Bible, edition of 1560; La Concordance\ndes Bibles, by Pierre de Besse; Les Marguerites de la Marguerite, of\nJean de La Haye, with a dedication to the Queen of Navarre; the book de\nla Charge et Dignite de l'Ambassadeur, by the Sieur de Villiers\nHotman; a Florilegium Rabbinicum of 1644; a Tibullus of 1567, with this\nmagnificent inscription: Venetiis, in aedibus Manutianis; and lastly, a\nDiogenes Laertius, printed at Lyons in 1644, which contained the famous\nvariant of the manuscript 411, thirteenth century, of the Vatican, and\nthose of the two manuscripts of Venice, 393 and 394, consulted with\nsuch fruitful results by Henri Estienne, and all the passages in Doric\ndialect which are only found in the celebrated manuscript of the twelfth\ncentury belonging to the Naples Library. M. Mabeuf never had any fire\nin his chamber, and went to bed at sundown, in order not to consume\nany candles. It seemed as though he had no longer any neighbors: people\navoided him when he went out; he perceived the fact. The wretchedness of\na child interests a mother, the wretchedness of a young man interests a\nyoung girl, the wretchedness of an old man interests no one. It is, of\nall distresses, the coldest. Still, Father Mabeuf had not entirely lost\nhis childlike serenity. His eyes acquired some vivacity when they rested\non his books, and he smiled when he gazed at the Diogenes Laertius,\nwhich was a unique copy. His bookcase with glass doors was the\nonly piece of furniture which he had kept beyond what was strictly\nindispensable.\n\nOne day, Mother Plutarque said to him:--\n\n\"I have no money to buy any dinner.\"\n\nWhat she called dinner was a loaf of bread and four or five potatoes.\n\n\"On credit?\" suggested M. Mabeuf.\n\n\"You know well that people refuse me.\"\n\nM. Mabeuf opened his bookcase, took a long look at all his books, one\nafter another, as a father obliged to decimate his children would gaze\nupon them before making a choice, then seized one hastily, put it\nin under his arm and went out. He returned two hours later, without\nanything under his arm, laid thirty sous on the table, and said:--\n\n\"You will get something for dinner.\"\n\nFrom that moment forth, Mother Plutarque saw a sombre veil, which was\nnever more lifted, descend over the old man's candid face.\n\nOn the following day, on the day after, and on the day after that, it\nhad to be done again.\n\nM. Mabeuf went out with a book and returned with a coin. As the\nsecond-hand dealers perceived that he was forced to sell, they purchased\nof him for twenty sous that for which he had paid twenty francs,\nsometimes at those very shops. Volume by volume, the whole library\nwent the same road. He said at times: \"But I am eighty;\" as though he\ncherished some secret hope that he should arrive at the end of his days\nbefore reaching the end of his books. His melancholy increased. Once,\nhowever, he had a pleasure. He had gone out with a Robert Estienne,\nwhich he had sold for thirty-five sous under the Quai Malaquais, and he\nreturned with an Aldus which he had bought for forty sous in the Rue des\nGres.--\"I owe five sous,\" he said, beaming on Mother Plutarque. That day\nhe had no dinner.\n\nHe belonged to the Horticultural Society. His destitution became known\nthere. The president of the society came to see him, promised to\nspeak to the Minister of Agriculture and Commerce about him, and did\nso.--\"Why, what!\" exclaimed the Minister, \"I should think so! An old\nsavant! a botanist! an inoffensive man! Something must be done for him!\"\nOn the following day, M. Mabeuf received an invitation to dine with the\nMinister. Trembling with joy, he showed the letter to Mother Plutarque.\n\"We are saved!\" said he. On the day appointed, he went to the Minister's\nhouse. He perceived that his ragged cravat, his long, square coat, and\nhis waxed shoes astonished the ushers. No one spoke to him, not even the\nMinister. About ten o'clock in the evening, while he was still waiting\nfor a word, he heard the Minister's wife, a beautiful woman in a\nlow-necked gown whom he had not ventured to approach, inquire: \"Who is\nthat old gentleman?\" He returned home on foot at midnight, in a driving\nrain-storm. He had sold an Elzevir to pay for a carriage in which to go\nthither.\n\nHe had acquired the habit of reading a few pages in his Diogenes\nLaertius every night, before he went to bed. He knew enough Greek to\nenjoy the peculiarities of the text which he owned. He had now no other\nenjoyment. Several weeks passed. All at once, Mother Plutarque fell ill.\nThere is one thing sadder than having no money with which to buy bread\nat the baker's and that is having no money to purchase drugs at the\napothecary's. One evening, the doctor had ordered a very expensive\npotion. And the malady was growing worse; a nurse was required. M.\nMabeuf opened his bookcase; there was nothing there. The last volume had\ntaken its departure. All that was left to him was Diogenes Laertius.\nHe put this unique copy under his arm, and went out. It was the 4th of\nJune, 1832; he went to the Porte Saint-Jacques, to Royal's successor,\nand returned with one hundred francs. He laid the pile of five-franc\npieces on the old serving-woman's nightstand, and returned to his\nchamber without saying a word.\n\nOn the following morning, at dawn, he seated himself on the overturned\npost in his garden, and he could be seen over the top of the hedge,\nsitting the whole morning motionless, with drooping head, his eyes\nvaguely fixed on the withered flower-beds. It rained at intervals; the\nold man did not seem to perceive the fact.\n\nIn the afternoon, extraordinary noises broke out in Paris. They\nresembled shots and the clamors of a multitude.\n\nFather Mabeuf raised his head. He saw a gardener passing, and\ninquired:--\n\n\"What is it?\"\n\nThe gardener, spade on back, replied in the most unconcerned tone:--\n\n\"It is the riots.\"\n\n\"What riots?\"\n\n\"Yes, they are fighting.\"\n\n\"Why are they fighting?\"\n\n\"Ah, good Heavens!\" ejaculated the gardener.\n\n\"In what direction?\" went on M. Mabeuf.\n\n\"In the neighborhood of the Arsenal.\"\n\nFather Mabeuf went to his room, took his hat, mechanically sought for a\nbook to place under his arm, found none, said: \"Ah! truly!\" and went off\nwith a bewildered air.\n\n\n\n\nBOOK TENTH.--THE 5TH OF JUNE, 1832\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I--THE SURFACE OF THE QUESTION\n\nOf what is revolt composed? Of nothing and of everything. Of an\nelectricity disengaged, little by little, of a flame suddenly darting\nforth, of a wandering force, of a passing breath. This breath encounters\nheads which speak, brains which dream, souls which suffer, passions\nwhich burn, wretchedness which howls, and bears them away.\n\nWhither?\n\nAt random. Athwart the state, the laws, athwart prosperity and the\ninsolence of others.\n\nIrritated convictions, embittered enthusiasms, agitated indignations,\ninstincts of war which have been repressed, youthful courage which has\nbeen exalted, generous blindness; curiosity, the taste for change,\nthe thirst for the unexpected, the sentiment which causes one to\ntake pleasure in reading the posters for the new play, and love,\nthe prompter's whistle, at the theatre; the vague hatreds, rancors,\ndisappointments, every vanity which thinks that destiny has bankrupted\nit; discomfort, empty dreams, ambitious that are hedged about, whoever\nhopes for a downfall, some outcome, in short, at the very bottom, the\nrabble, that mud which catches fire,--such are the elements of revolt.\nThat which is grandest and that which is basest; the beings who prowl\noutside of all bounds, awaiting an occasion, bohemians, vagrants,\nvagabonds of the cross-roads, those who sleep at night in a desert of\nhouses with no other roof than the cold clouds of heaven, those who,\neach day, demand their bread from chance and not from toil, the unknown\nof poverty and nothingness, the bare-armed, the bare-footed, belong to\nrevolt. Whoever cherishes in his soul a secret revolt against any deed\nwhatever on the part of the state, of life or of fate, is ripe for riot,\nand, as soon as it makes its appearance, he begins to quiver, and to\nfeel himself borne away with the whirlwind.\n\nRevolt is a sort of waterspout in the social atmosphere which forms\nsuddenly in certain conditions of temperature, and which, as it eddies\nabout, mounts, descends, thunders, tears, razes, crushes, demolishes,\nuproots, bearing with it great natures and small, the strong man and the\nfeeble mind, the tree trunk and the stalk of straw. Woe to him whom it\nbears away as well as to him whom it strikes! It breaks the one against\nthe other.\n\nIt communicates to those whom it seizes an indescribable and\nextraordinary power. It fills the first-comer with the force of events;\nit converts everything into projectiles. It makes a cannon-ball of a\nrough stone, and a general of a porter.\n\nIf we are to believe certain oracles of crafty political views, a little\nrevolt is desirable from the point of view of power. System: revolt\nstrengthens those governments which it does not overthrow. It puts\nthe army to the test; it consecrates the bourgeoisie, it draws out\nthe muscles of the police; it demonstrates the force of the social\nframework. It is an exercise in gymnastics; it is almost hygiene. Power\nis in better health after a revolt, as a man is after a good rubbing\ndown.\n\nRevolt, thirty years ago, was regarded from still other points of view.\n\nThere is for everything a theory, which proclaims itself \"good sense\";\nPhilintus against Alcestis; mediation offered between the false and the\ntrue; explanation, admonition, rather haughty extenuation which, because\nit is mingled with blame and excuse, thinks itself wisdom, and is often\nonly pedantry. A whole political school called \"the golden mean\" has\nbeen the outcome of this. As between cold water and hot water, it is\nthe lukewarm water party. This school with its false depth, all on the\nsurface, which dissects effects without going back to first causes,\nchides from its height of a demi-science, the agitation of the public\nsquare.\n\nIf we listen to this school, \"The riots which complicated the affair\nof 1830 deprived that great event of a portion of its purity. The\nRevolution of July had been a fine popular gale, abruptly followed\nby blue sky. They made the cloudy sky reappear. They caused that\nrevolution, at first so remarkable for its unanimity, to degenerate into\na quarrel. In the Revolution of July, as in all progress accomplished by\nfits and starts, there had been secret fractures; these riots rendered\nthem perceptible. It might have been said: 'Ah! this is broken.' After\nthe Revolution of July, one was sensible only of deliverance; after the\nriots, one was conscious of a catastrophe.\n\n\"All revolt closes the shops, depresses the funds, throws the Exchange\ninto consternation, suspends commerce, clogs business, precipitates\nfailures; no more money, private fortunes rendered uneasy, public credit\nshaken, industry disconcerted, capital withdrawing, work at a discount,\nfear everywhere; counter-shocks in every town. Hence gulfs. It has been\ncalculated that the first day of a riot costs France twenty millions,\nthe second day forty, the third sixty, a three days' uprising costs\none hundred and twenty millions, that is to say, if only the financial\nresult be taken into consideration, it is equivalent to a disaster, a\nshipwreck or a lost battle, which should annihilate a fleet of sixty\nships of the line.\n\n\"No doubt, historically, uprisings have their beauty; the war of the\npavements is no less grandiose, and no less pathetic, than the war of\nthickets: in the one there is the soul of forests, in the other the\nheart of cities; the one has Jean Chouan, the other has a Jeanne.\nRevolts have illuminated with a red glare all the most original points\nof the Parisian character, generosity, devotion, stormy gayety, students\nproving that bravery forms part of intelligence, the National Guard\ninvincible, bivouacs of shopkeepers, fortresses of street urchins,\ncontempt of death on the part of passers-by. Schools and legions clashed\ntogether. After all, between the combatants, there was only a difference\nof age; the race is the same; it is the same stoical men who died at the\nage of twenty for their ideas, at forty for their families. The\narmy, always a sad thing in civil wars, opposed prudence to audacity.\nUprisings, while proving popular intrepidity, also educated the courage\nof the bourgeois.\n\n\"This is well. But is all this worth the bloodshed? And to the bloodshed\nadd the future darkness, progress compromised, uneasiness among the\nbest men, honest liberals in despair, foreign absolutism happy in these\nwounds dealt to revolution by its own hand, the vanquished of 1830\ntriumphing and saying: 'We told you so!' Add Paris enlarged, possibly,\nbut France most assuredly diminished. Add, for all must needs be told,\nthe massacres which have too often dishonored the victory of order grown\nferocious over liberty gone mad. To sum up all, uprisings have been\ndisastrous.\"\n\nThus speaks that approximation to wisdom with which the bourgeoisie,\nthat approximation to the people, so willingly contents itself.\n\nFor our parts, we reject this word uprisings as too large, and\nconsequently as too convenient. We make a distinction between one\npopular movement and another popular movement. We do not inquire whether\nan uprising costs as much as a battle. Why a battle, in the first place?\nHere the question of war comes up. Is war less of a scourge than an\nuprising is of a calamity? And then, are all uprisings calamities? And\nwhat if the revolt of July did cost a hundred and twenty millions? The\nestablishment of Philip V. in Spain cost France two milliards. Even at\nthe same price, we should prefer the 14th of July. However, we reject\nthese figures, which appear to be reasons and which are only words. An\nuprising being given, we examine it by itself. In all that is said by\nthe doctrinarian objection above presented, there is no question of\nanything but effect, we seek the cause.\n\nWe will be explicit.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II--THE ROOT OF THE MATTER\n\nThere is such a thing as an uprising, and there is such a thing as\ninsurrection; these are two separate phases of wrath; one is in the\nwrong, the other is in the right. In democratic states, the only ones\nwhich are founded on justice, it sometimes happens that the fraction\nusurps; then the whole rises and the necessary claim of its rights may\nproceed as far as resort to arms. In all questions which result from\ncollective sovereignty, the war of the whole against the fraction is\ninsurrection; the attack of the fraction against the whole is revolt;\naccording as the Tuileries contain a king or the Convention, they\nare justly or unjustly attacked. The same cannon, pointed against the\npopulace, is wrong on the 10th of August, and right on the 14th of\nVendemiaire. Alike in appearance, fundamentally different in reality;\nthe Swiss defend the false, Bonaparte defends the true. That which\nuniversal suffrage has effected in its liberty and in its sovereignty\ncannot be undone by the street. It is the same in things pertaining\npurely to civilization; the instinct of the masses, clear-sighted\nto-day, may be troubled to-morrow. The same fury legitimate when\ndirected against Terray and absurd when directed against Turgot. The\ndestruction of machines, the pillage of warehouses, the breaking of\nrails, the demolition of docks, the false routes of multitudes, the\nrefusal by the people of justice to progress, Ramus assassinated by\nstudents, Rousseau driven out of Switzerland and stoned,--that is\nrevolt. Israel against Moses, Athens against Phocian, Rome against\nCicero,--that is an uprising; Paris against the Bastille,--that is\ninsurrection. The soldiers against Alexander, the sailors against\nChristopher Columbus,--this is the same revolt; impious revolt;\nwhy? Because Alexander is doing for Asia with the sword that which\nChristopher Columbus is doing for America with the compass; Alexander\nlike Columbus, is finding a world. These gifts of a world to\ncivilization are such augmentations of light, that all resistance in\nthat case is culpable. Sometimes the populace counterfeits fidelity to\nitself. The masses are traitors to the people. Is there, for example,\nanything stranger than that long and bloody protest of dealers in\ncontraband salt, a legitimate chronic revolt, which, at the decisive\nmoment, on the day of salvation, at the very hour of popular victory,\nespouses the throne, turns into chouannerie, and, from having been an\ninsurrection against, becomes an uprising for, sombre masterpieces of\nignorance! The contraband salt dealer escapes the royal gibbets, and\nwith a rope's end round his neck, mounts the white cockade. \"Death to\nthe salt duties,\" brings forth, \"Long live the King!\" The assassins of\nSaint-Barthelemy, the cut-throats of September, the manslaughterers of\nAvignon, the assassins of Coligny, the assassins of Madam Lamballe, the\nassassins of Brune, Miquelets, Verdets, Cadenettes, the companions of\nJehu, the chevaliers of Brassard,--behold an uprising. La Vendee is\na grand, catholic uprising. The sound of right in movement is\nrecognizable, it does not always proceed from the trembling of excited\nmasses; there are mad rages, there are cracked bells, all tocsins do not\ngive out the sound of bronze. The brawl of passions and ignorances\nis quite another thing from the shock of progress. Show me in what\ndirection you are going. Rise, if you will, but let it be that you may\ngrow great. There is no insurrection except in a forward direction. Any\nother sort of rising is bad; every violent step towards the rear is a\nrevolt; to retreat is to commit a deed of violence against the human\nrace. Insurrection is a fit of rage on the part of truth; the pavements\nwhich the uprising disturbs give forth the spark of right. These\npavements bequeath to the uprising only their mud. Danton against Louis\nXIV. is insurrection; Hebert against Danton is revolt.\n\nHence it results that if insurrection in given cases may be, as\nLafayette says, the most holy of duties, an uprising may be the most\nfatal of crimes.\n\nThere is also a difference in the intensity of heat; insurrection is\noften a volcano, revolt is often only a fire of straw.\n\nRevolt, as we have said, is sometimes found among those in power.\nPolignac is a rioter; Camille Desmoulins is one of the governing powers.\n\nInsurrection is sometimes resurrection.\n\nThe solution of everything by universal suffrage being an absolutely\nmodern fact, and all history anterior to this fact being, for the space\nof four thousand years, filled with violated right, and the suffering of\npeoples, each epoch of history brings with it that protest of which it\nis capable. Under the Caesars, there was no insurrection, but there was\nJuvenal.\n\nThe facit indignatio replaces the Gracchi.\n\nUnder the Caesars, there is the exile to Syene; there is also the man of\nthe Annales. We do not speak of the immense exile of Patmos who, on his\npart also, overwhelms the real world with a protest in the name of the\nideal world, who makes of his vision an enormous satire and casts on\nRome-Nineveh, on Rome-Babylon, on Rome-Sodom, the flaming reflection of\nthe Apocalypse. John on his rock is the sphinx on its pedestal; we may\nunderstand him, he is a Jew, and it is Hebrew; but the man who writes\nthe Annales is of the Latin race, let us rather say he is a Roman.\n\nAs the Neros reign in a black way, they should be painted to match. The\nwork of the graving-tool alone would be too pale; there must be poured\ninto the channel a concentrated prose which bites.\n\nDespots count for something in the question of philosophers. A word that\nis chained is a terrible word. The writer doubles and trebles his style\nwhen silence is imposed on a nation by its master. From this silence\nthere arises a certain mysterious plenitude which filters into thought\nand there congeals into bronze. The compression of history produces\nconciseness in the historian. The granite solidity of such and such a\ncelebrated prose is nothing but the accumulation effected by the tyrant.\n\nTyranny constrains the writer to conditions of diameter which are\naugmentations of force. The Ciceronian period, which hardly sufficed\nfor Verres, would be blunted on Caligula. The less spread of sail in\nthe phrase, the more intensity in the blow. Tacitus thinks with all his\nmight.\n\nThe honesty of a great heart, condensed in justice and truth, overwhelms\nas with lightning.\n\nBe it remarked, in passing, that Tacitus is not historically superposed\nupon Caesar. The Tiberii were reserved for him. Caesar and Tacitus\nare two successive phenomena, a meeting between whom seems to be\nmysteriously avoided, by the One who, when He sets the centuries on the\nstage, regulates the entrances and the exits. Caesar is great, Tacitus\nis great; God spares these two greatnesses by not allowing them to clash\nwith one another. The guardian of justice, in striking Caesar, might\nstrike too hard and be unjust. God does not will it. The great wars\nof Africa and Spain, the pirates of Sicily destroyed, civilization\nintroduced into Gaul, into Britanny, into Germany,--all this glory\ncovers the Rubicon. There is here a sort of delicacy of the divine\njustice, hesitating to let loose upon the illustrious usurper the\nformidable historian, sparing Caesar Tacitus, and according extenuating\ncircumstances to genius.\n\nCertainly, despotism remains despotism, even under the despot of genius.\nThere is corruption under all illustrious tyrants, but the moral pest is\nstill more hideous under infamous tyrants. In such reigns, nothing veils\nthe shame; and those who make examples, Tacitus as well as Juvenal,\nslap this ignominy which cannot reply, in the face, more usefully in the\npresence of all humanity.\n\nRome smells worse under Vitellius than under Sylla. Under Claudius and\nunder Domitian, there is a deformity of baseness corresponding to the\nrepulsiveness of the tyrant. The villainy of slaves is a direct product\nof the despot; a miasma exhales from these cowering consciences wherein\nthe master is reflected; public powers are unclean; hearts are small;\nconsciences are dull, souls are like vermin; thus it is under Caracalla,\nthus it is under Commodus, thus it is under Heliogabalus, while, from\nthe Roman Senate, under Caesar, there comes nothing but the odor of the\ndung which is peculiar to the eyries of the eagles.\n\nHence the advent, apparently tardy, of the Tacituses and the Juvenals;\nit is in the hour for evidence, that the demonstrator makes his\nappearance.\n\nBut Juvenal and Tacitus, like Isaiah in Biblical times, like Dante in\nthe Middle Ages, is man; riot and insurrection are the multitude, which\nis sometimes right and sometimes wrong.\n\nIn the majority of cases, riot proceeds from a material fact;\ninsurrection is always a moral phenomenon. Riot is Masaniello;\ninsurrection, Spartacus. Insurrection borders on mind, riot on the\nstomach; Gaster grows irritated; but Gaster, assuredly, is not always in\nthe wrong. In questions of famine, riot, Buzancais, for example, holds a\ntrue, pathetic, and just point of departure. Nevertheless, it remains\na riot. Why? It is because, right at bottom, it was wrong in form. Shy\nalthough in the right, violent although strong, it struck at random; it\nwalked like a blind elephant; it left behind it the corpses of old\nmen, of women, and of children; it wished the blood of inoffensive and\ninnocent persons without knowing why. The nourishment of the people is a\ngood object; to massacre them is a bad means.\n\nAll armed protests, even the most legitimate, even that of the 10th of\nAugust, even that of July 14th, begin with the same troubles. Before\nthe right gets set free, there is foam and tumult. In the beginning, the\ninsurrection is a riot, just as a river is a torrent. Ordinarily it ends\nin that ocean: revolution. Sometimes, however, coming from those lofty\nmountains which dominate the moral horizon, justice, wisdom, reason,\nright, formed of the pure snow of the ideal, after a long fall from\nrock to rock, after having reflected the sky in its transparency and\nincreased by a hundred affluents in the majestic mien of triumph,\ninsurrection is suddenly lost in some quagmire, as the Rhine is in a\nswamp.\n\nAll this is of the past, the future is another thing. Universal suffrage\nhas this admirable property, that it dissolves riot in its inception,\nand, by giving the vote to insurrection, it deprives it of its arms.\nThe disappearance of wars, of street wars as well as of wars on the\nfrontiers, such is the inevitable progression. Whatever To-day may be,\nTo-morrow will be peace.\n\nHowever, insurrection, riot, and points of difference between the former\nand the latter,--the bourgeois, properly speaking, knows nothing of such\nshades. In his mind, all is sedition, rebellion pure and simple, the\nrevolt of the dog against his master, an attempt to bite whom must be\npunished by the chain and the kennel, barking, snapping, until such day\nas the head of the dog, suddenly enlarged, is outlined vaguely in the\ngloom face to face with the lion.\n\nThen the bourgeois shouts: \"Long live the people!\"\n\nThis explanation given, what does the movement of June, 1832, signify,\nso far as history is concerned? Is it a revolt? Is it an insurrection?\n\nIt may happen to us, in placing this formidable event on the stage, to\nsay revolt now and then, but merely to distinguish superficial facts,\nand always preserving the distinction between revolt, the form, and\ninsurrection, the foundation.\n\nThis movement of 1832 had, in its rapid outbreak and in its melancholy\nextinction, so much grandeur, that even those who see in it only an\nuprising, never refer to it otherwise than with respect. For them, it\nis like a relic of 1830. Excited imaginations, say they, are not to be\ncalmed in a day. A revolution cannot be cut off short. It must needs\nundergo some undulations before it returns to a state of rest, like a\nmountain sinking into the plain. There are no Alps without their Jura,\nnor Pyrenees without the Asturias.\n\nThis pathetic crisis of contemporary history which the memory of\nParisians calls \"the epoch of the riots,\" is certainly a characteristic\nhour amid the stormy hours of this century. A last word, before we enter\non the recital.\n\nThe facts which we are about to relate belong to that dramatic and\nliving reality, which the historian sometimes neglects for lack of time\nand space. There, nevertheless, we insist upon it, is life, palpitation,\nhuman tremor. Petty details, as we think we have already said, are, so\nto speak, the foliage of great events, and are lost in the distance of\nhistory. The epoch, surnamed \"of the riots,\" abounds in details of\nthis nature. Judicial inquiries have not revealed, and perhaps have not\nsounded the depths, for another reason than history. We shall therefore\nbring to light, among the known and published peculiarities, things\nwhich have not heretofore been known, about facts over which have passed\nthe forgetfulness of some, and the death of others. The majority of the\nactors in these gigantic scenes have disappeared; beginning with the\nvery next day they held their peace; but of what we shall relate, we\nshall be able to say: \"We have seen this.\" We alter a few names, for\nhistory relates and does not inform against, but the deed which we shall\npaint will be genuine. In accordance with the conditions of the book\nwhich we are now writing, we shall show only one side and one episode,\nand certainly, the least known at that, of the two days, the 5th and the\n6th of June, 1832, but we shall do it in such wise that the reader may\ncatch a glimpse, beneath the gloomy veil which we are about to lift, of\nthe real form of this frightful public adventure.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III--A BURIAL; AN OCCASION TO BE BORN AGAIN\n\nIn the spring of 1832, although the cholera had been chilling all\nminds for the last three months and had cast over their agitation an\nindescribable and gloomy pacification, Paris had already long been ripe\nfor commotion. As we have said, the great city resembles a piece of\nartillery; when it is loaded, it suffices for a spark to fall, and the\nshot is discharged. In June, 1832, the spark was the death of General\nLamarque.\n\nLamarque was a man of renown and of action. He had had in succession,\nunder the Empire and under the Restoration, the sorts of bravery\nrequisite for the two epochs, the bravery of the battle-field and the\nbravery of the tribune. He was as eloquent as he had been valiant; a\nsword was discernible in his speech. Like Foy, his predecessor, after\nupholding the command, he upheld liberty; he sat between the left and\nthe extreme left, beloved of the people because he accepted the chances\nof the future, beloved of the populace because he had served the\nEmperor well; he was, in company with Comtes Gerard and Drouet, one\nof Napoleon's marshals in petto. The treaties of 1815 removed him as\na personal offence. He hated Wellington with a downright hatred which\npleased the multitude; and, for seventeen years, he majestically\npreserved the sadness of Waterloo, paying hardly any attention to\nintervening events. In his death agony, at his last hour, he clasped to\nhis breast a sword which had been presented to him by the officers of\nthe Hundred Days. Napoleon had died uttering the word army, Lamarque\nuttering the word country.\n\nHis death, which was expected, was dreaded by the people as a loss, and\nby the government as an occasion. This death was an affliction. Like\neverything that is bitter, affliction may turn to revolt. This is what\ntook place.\n\nOn the preceding evening, and on the morning of the 5th of June, the day\nappointed for Lamarque's burial, the Faubourg Saint-Antoine, which the\nprocession was to touch at, assumed a formidable aspect. This tumultuous\nnetwork of streets was filled with rumors. They armed themselves as best\nthey might. Joiners carried off door-weights of their establishment\n\"to break down doors.\" One of them had made himself a dagger of a\nstocking-weaver's hook by breaking off the hook and sharpening the\nstump. Another, who was in a fever \"to attack,\" slept wholly dressed\nfor three days. A carpenter named Lombier met a comrade, who asked him:\n\"Whither are you going?\" \"Eh! well, I have no weapons.\" \"What then?\"\n\"I'm going to my timber-yard to get my compasses.\" \"What for?\" \"I don't\nknow,\" said Lombier. A certain Jacqueline, an expeditious man, accosted\nsome passing artisans: \"Come here, you!\" He treated them to ten sous'\nworth of wine and said: \"Have you work?\" \"No.\" \"Go to Filspierre,\nbetween the Barriere Charonne and the Barriere Montreuil, and you will\nfind work.\" At Filspierre's they found cartridges and arms. Certain\nwell-known leaders were going the rounds, that is to say, running from\none house to another, to collect their men. At Barthelemy's, near the\nBarriere du Trone, at Capel's, near the Petit-Chapeau, the drinkers\naccosted each other with a grave air. They were heard to say: \"Have you\nyour pistol?\" \"Under my blouse.\" \"And you?\" \"Under my shirt.\" In the\nRue Traversiere, in front of the Bland workshop, and in the yard of\nthe Maison-Brulee, in front of tool-maker Bernier's, groups whispered\ntogether. Among them was observed a certain Mavot, who never remained\nmore than a week in one shop, as the masters always discharged him\n\"because they were obliged to dispute with him every day.\" Mavot was\nkilled on the following day at the barricade of the Rue Menilmontant.\nPretot, who was destined to perish also in the struggle, seconded Mavot,\nand to the question: \"What is your object?\" he replied: \"Insurrection.\"\nWorkmen assembled at the corner of the Rue de Bercy, waited for a\ncertain Lemarin, the revolutionary agent for the Faubourg Saint-Marceau.\nWatchwords were exchanged almost publicly.\n\nOn the 5th of June, accordingly, a day of mingled rain and sun, General\nLamarque's funeral procession traversed Paris with official military\npomp, somewhat augmented through precaution. Two battalions, with draped\ndrums and reversed arms, ten thousand National Guards, with their swords\nat their sides, escorted the coffin. The hearse was drawn by young men.\nThe officers of the Invalides came immediately behind it, bearing laurel\nbranches. Then came an innumerable, strange, agitated multitude, the\nsectionaries of the Friends of the People, the Law School, the Medical\nSchool, refugees of all nationalities, and Spanish, Italian, German,\nand Polish flags, tricolored horizontal banners, every possible sort of\nbanner, children waving green boughs, stone-cutters and carpenters who\nwere on strike at the moment, printers who were recognizable by their\npaper caps, marching two by two, three by three, uttering cries, nearly\nall of them brandishing sticks, some brandishing sabres, without order\nand yet with a single soul, now a tumultuous rout, again a column.\nSquads chose themselves leaders; a man armed with a pair of pistols in\nfull view, seemed to pass the host in review, and the files separated\nbefore him. On the side alleys of the boulevards, in the branches of the\ntrees, on balconies, in windows, on the roofs, swarmed the heads of men,\nwomen, and children; all eyes were filled with anxiety. An armed throng\nwas passing, and a terrified throng looked on.\n\nThe Government, on its side, was taking observations. It observed with\nits hand on its sword. Four squadrons of carabineers could be seen in\nthe Place Louis XV. in their saddles, with their trumpets at their head,\ncartridge-boxes filled and muskets loaded, all in readiness to march;\nin the Latin country and at the Jardin des Plantes, the Municipal Guard\nechelonned from street to street; at the Halle-aux-Vins, a squadron of\ndragoons; at the Greve half of the 12th Light Infantry, the other\nhalf being at the Bastille; the 6th Dragoons at the Celestins; and the\ncourtyard of the Louvre full of artillery. The remainder of the troops\nwere confined to their barracks, without reckoning the regiments of the\nenvirons of Paris. Power being uneasy, held suspended over the menacing\nmultitude twenty-four thousand soldiers in the city and thirty thousand\nin the banlieue.\n\nDivers reports were in circulation in the cortege. Legitimist tricks\nwere hinted at; they spoke of the Duc de Reichstadt, whom God had marked\nout for death at that very moment when the populace were designating\nhim for the Empire. One personage, whose name has remained unknown,\nannounced that at a given hour two overseers who had been won over,\nwould throw open the doors of a factory of arms to the people. That\nwhich predominated on the uncovered brows of the majority of those\npresent was enthusiasm mingled with dejection. Here and there, also, in\nthat multitude given over to such violent but noble emotions, there were\nvisible genuine visages of criminals and ignoble mouths which said: \"Let\nus plunder!\" There are certain agitations which stir up the bottoms of\nmarshes and make clouds of mud rise through the water. A phenomenon to\nwhich \"well drilled\" policemen are no strangers.\n\nThe procession proceeded, with feverish slowness, from the house of the\ndeceased, by way of the boulevards as far as the Bastille. It rained\nfrom time to time; the rain mattered nothing to that throng. Many\nincidents, the coffin borne round the Vendome column, stones thrown at\nthe Duc de Fitz-James, who was seen on a balcony with his hat on his\nhead, the Gallic cock torn from a popular flag and dragged in the mire,\na policeman wounded with a blow from a sword at the Porte Saint-Martin,\nan officer of the 12th Light Infantry saying aloud: \"I am a Republican,\"\nthe Polytechnic School coming up unexpectedly against orders to remain\nat home, the shouts of: \"Long live the Polytechnique! Long live the\nRepublic!\" marked the passage of the funeral train. At the Bastille,\nlong files of curious and formidable people who descended from the\nFaubourg Saint-Antoine, effected a junction with the procession, and a\ncertain terrible seething began to agitate the throng.\n\nOne man was heard to say to another: \"Do you see that fellow with a\nred beard, he's the one who will give the word when we are to fire.\" It\nappears that this red beard was present, at another riot, the Quenisset\naffair, entrusted with this same function.\n\nThe hearse passed the Bastille, traversed the small bridge, and reached\nthe esplanade of the bridge of Austerlitz. There it halted. The crowd,\nsurveyed at that moment with a bird'seye view, would have presented the\naspect of a comet whose head was on the esplanade and whose tail spread\nout over the Quai Bourdon, covered the Bastille, and was prolonged on\nthe boulevard as far as the Porte Saint-Martin. A circle was traced\naround the hearse. The vast rout held their peace. Lafayette spoke and\nbade Lamarque farewell. This was a touching and august instant, all\nheads uncovered, all hearts beat high.\n\nAll at once, a man on horseback, clad in black, made his appearance\nin the middle of the group with a red flag, others say, with a pike\nsurmounted with a red liberty-cap. Lafayette turned aside his head.\nExelmans quitted the procession.\n\nThis red flag raised a storm, and disappeared in the midst of it. From\nthe Boulevard Bourdon to the bridge of Austerlitz one of those clamors\nwhich resemble billows stirred the multitude. Two prodigious shouts went\nup: \"Lamarque to the Pantheon!--Lafayette to the Town-hall!\" Some young\nmen, amid the declamations of the throng, harnessed themselves and\nbegan to drag Lamarque in the hearse across the bridge of Austerlitz and\nLafayette in a hackney-coach along the Quai Morland.\n\nIn the crowd which surrounded and cheered Lafayette, it was noticed\nthat a German showed himself named Ludwig Snyder, who died a centenarian\nafterwards, who had also been in the war of 1776, and who had fought at\nTrenton under Washington, and at Brandywine under Lafayette.\n\nIn the meantime, the municipal cavalry on the left bank had been set\nin motion, and came to bar the bridge, on the right bank the dragoons\nemerged from the Celestins and deployed along the Quai Morland. The men\nwho were dragging Lafayette suddenly caught sight of them at the corner\nof the quay and shouted: \"The dragoons!\" The dragoons advanced at a\nwalk, in silence, with their pistols in their holsters, their swords in\ntheir scabbards, their guns slung in their leather sockets, with an air\nof gloomy expectation.\n\nThey halted two hundred paces from the little bridge. The carriage in\nwhich sat Lafayette advanced to them, their ranks opened and allowed it\nto pass, and then closed behind it. At that moment the dragoons and the\ncrowd touched. The women fled in terror. What took place during that\nfatal minute? No one can say. It is the dark moment when two clouds come\ntogether. Some declare that a blast of trumpets sounding the charge was\nheard in the direction of the Arsenal others that a blow from a dagger\nwas given by a child to a dragoon. The fact is, that three shots were\nsuddenly discharged: the first killed Cholet, chief of the squadron,\nthe second killed an old deaf woman who was in the act of closing her\nwindow, the third singed the shoulder of an officer; a woman screamed:\n\"They are beginning too soon!\" and all at once, a squadron of dragoons\nwhich had remained in the barracks up to this time, was seen to debouch\nat a gallop with bared swords, through the Rue Bassompierre and the\nBoulevard Bourdon, sweeping all before them.\n\nThen all is said, the tempest is loosed, stones rain down, a fusillade\nbreaks forth, many precipitate themselves to the bottom of the bank, and\npass the small arm of the Seine, now filled in, the timber-yards of the\nIsle Louviers, that vast citadel ready to hand, bristle with combatants,\nstakes are torn up, pistol-shots fired, a barricade begun, the young men\nwho are thrust back pass the Austerlitz bridge with the hearse at a run,\nand the municipal guard, the carabineers rush up, the dragoons ply their\nswords, the crowd disperses in all directions, a rumor of war flies to\nall four quarters of Paris, men shout: \"To arms!\" they run, tumble down,\nflee, resist. Wrath spreads abroad the riot as wind spreads a fire.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV--THE EBULLITIONS OF FORMER DAYS\n\nNothing is more extraordinary than the first breaking out of a riot.\nEverything bursts forth everywhere at once. Was it foreseen? Yes. Was it\nprepared? No. Whence comes it? From the pavements. Whence falls it? From\nthe clouds. Here insurrection assumes the character of a plot; there\nof an improvisation. The first comer seizes a current of the throng\nand leads it whither he wills. A beginning full of terror, in which is\nmingled a sort of formidable gayety. First come clamors, the shops are\nclosed, the displays of the merchants disappear; then come isolated\nshots; people flee; blows from gun-stocks beat against portes cocheres,\nservants can be heard laughing in the courtyards of houses and saying:\n\"There's going to be a row!\"\n\nA quarter of an hour had not elapsed when this is what was taking place\nat twenty different spots in Paris at once.\n\nIn the Rue Sainte-Croix-de-la-Bretonnerie, twenty young men, bearded and\nwith long hair, entered a dram-shop and emerged a moment later, carrying\na horizontal tricolored flag covered with crape, and having at their\nhead three men armed, one with a sword, one with a gun, and the third\nwith a pike.\n\nIn the Rue des Nonaindieres, a very well-dressed bourgeois, who had a\nprominent belly, a sonorous voice, a bald head, a lofty brow, a black\nbeard, and one of these stiff mustaches which will not lie flat, offered\ncartridges publicly to passers-by.\n\nIn the Rue Saint-Pierre-Montmartre, men with bare arms carried about a\nblack flag, on which could be read in white letters this inscription:\n\"Republic or Death!\" In the Rue des Jeuneurs, Rue du Cadran, Rue\nMontorgueil, Rue Mandar, groups appeared waving flags on which could be\ndistinguished in gold letters, the word section with a number. One of\nthese flags was red and blue with an almost imperceptible stripe of\nwhite between.\n\nThey pillaged a factory of small-arms on the Boulevard Saint-Martin, and\nthree armorers' shops, the first in the Rue Beaubourg, the second in the\nRue Michel-le-Comte, the other in the Rue du Temple. In a few minutes,\nthe thousand hands of the crowd had seized and carried off two hundred\nand thirty guns, nearly all double-barrelled, sixty-four swords, and\neighty-three pistols. In order to provide more arms, one man took the\ngun, the other the bayonet.\n\nOpposite the Quai de la Greve, young men armed with muskets installed\nthemselves in the houses of some women for the purpose of firing. One\nof them had a flint-lock. They rang, entered, and set about making\ncartridges. One of these women relates: \"I did not know what cartridges\nwere; it was my husband who told me.\"\n\nOne cluster broke into a curiosity shop in the Rue des Vielles\nHaudriettes, and seized yataghans and Turkish arms.\n\nThe body of a mason who had been killed by a gun-shot lay in the Rue de\nla Perle.\n\nAnd then on the right bank, the left bank, on the quays, on the\nboulevards, in the Latin country, in the quarter of the Halles, panting\nmen, artisans, students, members of sections read proclamations and\nshouted: \"To arms!\" broke street lanterns, unharnessed carriages,\nunpaved the streets, broke in the doors of houses, uprooted trees,\nrummaged cellars, rolled out hogsheads, heaped up paving-stones, rough\nslabs, furniture and planks, and made barricades.\n\nThey forced the bourgeois to assist them in this. They entered the\ndwellings of women, they forced them to hand over the swords and guns\nof their absent husbands, and they wrote on the door, with whiting: \"The\narms have been delivered\"; some signed \"their names\" to receipts for\nthe guns and swords and said: \"Send for them to-morrow at the Mayor's\noffice.\" They disarmed isolated sentinels and National Guardsmen in\nthe streets on their way to the Townhall. They tore the epaulets from\nofficers. In the Rue du Cimitiere-Saint-Nicholas, an officer of the\nNational Guard, on being pursued by a crowd armed with clubs and foils,\ntook refuge with difficulty in a house, whence he was only able to\nemerge at nightfall and in disguise.\n\nIn the Quartier Saint-Jacques, the students swarmed out of their\nhotels and ascended the Rue Saint-Hyacinthe to the Cafe du Progress,\nor descended to the Cafe des Sept-Billards, in the Rue des Mathurins.\nThere, in front of the door, young men mounted on the stone\ncorner-posts, distributed arms. They plundered the timber-yard in the\nRue Transnonain in order to obtain material for barricades. On a single\npoint the inhabitants resisted, at the corner of the Rue Sainte-Avoye\nand the Rue Simon-Le-Franc, where they destroyed the barricade with\ntheir own hands. At a single point the insurgents yielded; they\nabandoned a barricade begun in the Rue de Temple after having fired on\na detachment of the National Guard, and fled through the Rue de la\nCorderie. The detachment picked up in the barricade a red flag, a\npackage of cartridges, and three hundred pistol-balls. The National\nGuardsmen tore up the flag, and carried off its tattered remains on the\npoints of their bayonets.\n\nAll that we are here relating slowly and successively took place\nsimultaneously at all points of the city in the midst of a vast tumult,\nlike a mass of tongues of lightning in one clap of thunder. In less than\nan hour, twenty-seven barricades sprang out of the earth in the quarter\nof the Halles alone. In the centre was that famous house No. 50, which\nwas the fortress of Jeanne and her six hundred companions, and which,\nflanked on the one hand by a barricade at Saint-Merry, and on the other\nby a barricade of the Rue Maubuee, commanded three streets, the Rue\ndes Arcis, the Rue Saint-Martin, and the Rue Aubry-le-Boucher, which\nit faced. The barricades at right angles fell back, the one of the\nRue Montorgueil on the Grande-Truanderie, the other of the Rue\nGeoffroy-Langevin on the Rue Sainte-Avoye. Without reckoning innumerable\nbarricades in twenty other quarters of Paris, in the Marais, at\nMont-Sainte-Genevieve; one in the Rue Menilmontant, where was visible\na porte cochere torn from its hinges; another near the little bridge of\nthe Hotel-Dieu made with an \"ecossais,\" which had been unharnessed and\noverthrown, three hundred paces from the Prefecture of Police.\n\nAt the barricade of the Rue des Menetriers, a well-dressed man\ndistributed money to the workmen. At the barricade of the Rue Grenetat,\na horseman made his appearance and handed to the one who seemed to be\nthe commander of the barricade what had the appearance of a roll of\nsilver. \"Here,\" said he, \"this is to pay expenses, wine, et caetera.\"\nA light-haired young man, without a cravat, went from barricade to\nbarricade, carrying pass-words. Another, with a naked sword, a blue\npolice cap on his head, placed sentinels. In the interior, beyond the\nbarricades, the wine-shops and porters' lodges were converted into\nguard-houses. Otherwise the riot was conducted after the most scientific\nmilitary tactics. The narrow, uneven, sinuous streets, full of angles\nand turns, were admirably chosen; the neighborhood of the Halles, in\nparticular, a network of streets more intricate than a forest. The\nSociety of the Friends of the People had, it was said, undertaken to\ndirect the insurrection in the Quartier Sainte-Avoye. A man killed in\nthe Rue du Ponceau who was searched had on his person a plan of Paris.\n\nThat which had really undertaken the direction of the uprising was a\nsort of strange impetuosity which was in the air. The insurrection\nhad abruptly built barricades with one hand, and with the other seized\nnearly all the posts of the garrison. In less than three hours, like a\ntrain of powder catching fire, the insurgents had invaded and occupied,\non the right bank, the Arsenal, the Mayoralty of the Place Royale, the\nwhole of the Marais, the Popincourt arms manufactory, la Galiote, the\nChateau-d'Eau, and all the streets near the Halles; on the left bank,\nthe barracks of the Veterans, Sainte-Pelagie, the Place Maubert, the\npowder magazine of the Deux-Moulins, and all the barriers. At five\no'clock in the evening, they were masters of the Bastille, of the\nLingerie, of the Blancs-Manteaux; their scouts had reached the Place\ndes Victoires, and menaced the Bank, the Petits-Peres barracks, and the\nPost-Office. A third of Paris was in the hands of the rioters.\n\nThe conflict had been begun on a gigantic scale at all points; and, as a\nresult of the disarming domiciliary visits, and armorers' shops hastily\ninvaded, was, that the combat which had begun with the throwing of\nstones was continued with gun-shots.\n\nAbout six o'clock in the evening, the Passage du Saumon became the field\nof battle. The uprising was at one end, the troops were at the other.\nThey fired from one gate to the other. An observer, a dreamer, the\nauthor of this book, who had gone to get a near view of this volcano,\nfound himself in the passage between the two fires. All that he had to\nprotect him from the bullets was the swell of the two half-columns which\nseparate the shops; he remained in this delicate situation for nearly\nhalf an hour.\n\nMeanwhile the call to arms was beaten, the National Guard armed in\nhaste, the legions emerged from the Mayoralities, the regiments from\ntheir barracks. Opposite the passage de l'Ancre a drummer received a\nblow from a dagger. Another, in the Rue du Cygne, was assailed by thirty\nyoung men who broke his instrument, and took away his sword. Another was\nkilled in the Rue Grenier-Saint-Lazare. In the Rue-Michelle-Comte, three\nofficers fell dead one after the other. Many of the Municipal Guards, on\nbeing wounded, in the Rue des Lombards, retreated.\n\nIn front of the Cour-Batave, a detachment of National Guards found a red\nflag bearing the following inscription: Republican revolution, No. 127.\nWas this a revolution, in fact?\n\nThe insurrection had made of the centre of Paris a sort of inextricable,\ntortuous, colossal citadel.\n\nThere was the hearth; there, evidently, was the question. All the rest\nwas nothing but skirmishes. The proof that all would be decided there\nlay in the fact that there was no fighting going on there as yet.\n\nIn some regiments, the soldiers were uncertain, which added to the\nfearful uncertainty of the crisis. They recalled the popular ovation\nwhich had greeted the neutrality of the 53d of the Line in July, 1830.\nTwo intrepid men, tried in great wars, the Marshal Lobau and General\nBugeaud, were in command, Bugeaud under Lobau. Enormous patrols,\ncomposed of battalions of the Line, enclosed in entire companies of the\nNational Guard, and preceded by a commissary of police wearing his scarf\nof office, went to reconnoitre the streets in rebellion. The insurgents,\non their side, placed videttes at the corners of all open spaces, and\naudaciously sent their patrols outside the barricades. Each side was\nwatching the other. The Government, with an army in its hand, hesitated;\nthe night was almost upon them, and the Saint-Merry tocsin began to make\nitself heard. The Minister of War at that time, Marshal Soult, who had\nseen Austerlitz, regarded this with a gloomy air.\n\nThese old sailors, accustomed to correct manoeuvres and having as\nresource and guide only tactics, that compass of battles, are utterly\ndisconcerted in the presence of that immense foam which is called public\nwrath.\n\nThe National Guards of the suburbs rushed up in haste and disorder. A\nbattalion of the 12th Light came at a run from Saint-Denis, the 14th of\nthe Line arrived from Courbevoie, the batteries of the Military School\nhad taken up their position on the Carrousel; cannons were descending\nfrom Vincennes.\n\nSolitude was formed around the Tuileries. Louis Philippe was perfectly\nserene.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V--ORIGINALITY OF PARIS\n\nDuring the last two years, as we have said, Paris had witnessed more\nthan one insurrection. Nothing is, generally, more singularly calm than\nthe physiognomy of Paris during an uprising beyond the bounds of\nthe rebellious quarters. Paris very speedily accustoms herself to\nanything,--it is only a riot,--and Paris has so many affairs on hand,\nthat she does not put herself out for so small a matter. These colossal\ncities alone can offer such spectacles. These immense enclosures alone\ncan contain at the same time civil war and an odd and indescribable\ntranquillity. Ordinarily, when an insurrection commences, when the\nshop-keeper hears the drum, the call to arms, the general alarm, he\ncontents himself with the remark:--\n\n\"There appears to be a squabble in the Rue Saint-Martin.\"\n\nOr:--\n\n\"In the Faubourg Saint-Antoine.\"\n\nOften he adds carelessly:--\n\n\"Or somewhere in that direction.\"\n\nLater on, when the heart-rending and mournful hubbub of musketry and\nfiring by platoons becomes audible, the shopkeeper says:--\n\n\"It's getting hot! Hullo, it's getting hot!\"\n\nA moment later, the riot approaches and gains in force, he shuts up his\nshop precipitately, hastily dons his uniform, that is to say, he places\nhis merchandise in safety and risks his own person.\n\nMen fire in a square, in a passage, in a blind alley; they take and\nre-take the barricade; blood flows, the grape-shot riddles the fronts\nof the houses, the balls kill people in their beds, corpses encumber the\nstreets. A few streets away, the shock of billiard-balls can be heard in\nthe cafes.\n\nThe theatres open their doors and present vaudevilles; the curious laugh\nand chat a couple of paces distant from these streets filled with\nwar. Hackney-carriages go their way; passers-by are going to a dinner\nsomewhere in town. Sometimes in the very quarter where the fighting is\ngoing on.\n\nIn 1831, a fusillade was stopped to allow a wedding party to pass.\n\nAt the time of the insurrection of 1839, in the Rue Saint-Martin a\nlittle, infirm old man, pushing a hand-cart surmounted by a tricolored\nrag, in which he had carafes filled with some sort of liquid, went and\ncame from barricade to troops and from troops to the barricade, offering\nhis glasses of cocoa impartially,--now to the Government, now to\nanarchy.\n\nNothing can be stranger; and this is the peculiar character of uprisings\nin Paris, which cannot be found in any other capital. To this end, two\nthings are requisite, the size of Paris and its gayety. The city of\nVoltaire and Napoleon is necessary.\n\nOn this occasion, however, in the resort to arms of June 25th, 1832, the\ngreat city felt something which was, perhaps, stronger than itself. It\nwas afraid.\n\nClosed doors, windows, and shutters were to be seen everywhere, in the\nmost distant and most \"disinterested\" quarters. The courageous took to\narms, the poltroons hid. The busy and heedless passer-by disappeared.\nMany streets were empty at four o'clock in the morning.\n\nAlarming details were hawked about, fatal news was disseminated,--that\nthey were masters of the Bank;--that there were six hundred of them\nin the Cloister of Saint-Merry alone, entrenched and embattled in the\nchurch; that the line was not to be depended on; that Armand Carrel\nhad been to see Marshal Clausel and that the Marshal had said: \"Get a\nregiment first\"; that Lafayette was ill, but that he had said to them,\nnevertheless: \"I am with you. I will follow you wherever there is room\nfor a chair\"; that one must be on one's guard; that at night there would\nbe people pillaging isolated dwellings in the deserted corners of Paris\n(there the imagination of the police, that Anne Radcliffe mixed up with\nthe Government was recognizable); that a battery had been established\nin the Rue Aubry le Boucher; that Lobau and Bugeaud were putting their\nheads together, and that, at midnight, or at daybreak at latest, four\ncolumns would march simultaneously on the centre of the uprising, the\nfirst coming from the Bastille, the second from the Porte Saint-Martin,\nthe third from the Greve, the fourth from the Halles; that perhaps,\nalso, the troops would evacuate Paris and withdraw to the Champ-de-Mars;\nthat no one knew what would happen, but that this time, it certainly was\nserious.\n\nPeople busied themselves over Marshal Soult's hesitations. Why did not\nhe attack at once? It is certain that he was profoundly absorbed. The\nold lion seemed to scent an unknown monster in that gloom.\n\nEvening came, the theatres did not open; the patrols circulated with\nan air of irritation; passers-by were searched; suspicious persons were\narrested. By nine o'clock, more than eight hundred persons had been\narrested, the Prefecture of Police was encumbered with them, so was the\nConciergerie, so was La Force.\n\nAt the Conciergerie in particular, the long vault which is called the\nRue de Paris was littered with trusses of straw upon which lay a heap\nof prisoners, whom the man of Lyons, Lagrange, harangued valiantly.\nAll that straw rustled by all these men, produced the sound of a heavy\nshower. Elsewhere prisoners slept in the open air in the meadows, piled\non top of each other.\n\nAnxiety reigned everywhere, and a certain tremor which was not habitual\nwith Paris.\n\nPeople barricaded themselves in their houses; wives and mothers were\nuneasy; nothing was to be heard but this: \"Ah! my God! He has not come\nhome!\" There was hardly even the distant rumble of a vehicle to be\nheard.\n\nPeople listened on their thresholds, to the rumors, the shouts, the\ntumult, the dull and indistinct sounds, to the things that were\nsaid: \"It is cavalry,\" or: \"Those are the caissons galloping,\" to the\ntrumpets, the drums, the firing, and, above all, to that lamentable\nalarm peal from Saint-Merry.\n\nThey waited for the first cannon-shot. Men sprang up at the corners of\nthe streets and disappeared, shouting: \"Go home!\" And people made haste\nto bolt their doors. They said: \"How will all this end?\" From moment to\nmoment, in proportion as the darkness descended, Paris seemed to take on\na more mournful hue from the formidable flaming of the revolt.\n\n\n\n\nBOOK ELEVENTH.--THE ATOM FRATERNIZES WITH THE HURRICANE\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I--SOME EXPLANATIONS WITH REGARD TO THE ORIGIN OF GAVROCHE'S\nPOETRY. THE INFLUENCE OF AN ACADEMICIAN ON THIS POETRY\n\nAt the instant when the insurrection, arising from the shock of the\npopulace and the military in front of the Arsenal, started a movement\nin advance and towards the rear in the multitude which was following the\nhearse and which, through the whole length of the boulevards, weighed,\nso to speak, on the head of the procession, there arose a frightful ebb.\nThe rout was shaken, their ranks were broken, all ran, fled, made their\nescape, some with shouts of attack, others with the pallor of flight.\nThe great river which covered the boulevards divided in a twinkling,\noverflowed to right and left, and spread in torrents over two hundred\nstreets at once with the roar of a sewer that has broken loose.\n\nAt that moment, a ragged child who was coming down through the Rue\nMenilmontant, holding in his hand a branch of blossoming laburnum which\nhe had just plucked on the heights of Belleville, caught sight of an old\nholster-pistol in the show-window of a bric-a-brac merchant's shop.\n\n\"Mother What's-your-name, I'm going to borrow your machine.\"\n\nAnd off he ran with the pistol.\n\nTwo minutes later, a flood of frightened bourgeois who were fleeing\nthrough the Rue Amelot and the Rue Basse, encountered the lad\nbrandishing his pistol and singing:--\n\n               La nuit on ne voit rien,\n               Le jour on voit tres bien,\n               D'un ecrit apocrypha\n               Le bourgeois s'ebouriffe,\n               Pratiquez la vertu,\n               Tutu, chapeau pointu![44]\n\n\nIt was little Gavroche on his way to the wars.\n\nOn the boulevard he noticed that the pistol had no trigger.\n\nWho was the author of that couplet which served to punctuate his march,\nand of all the other songs which he was fond of singing on occasion? We\nknow not. Who does know? Himself, perhaps. However, Gavroche was well\nup in all the popular tunes in circulation, and he mingled with them his\nown chirpings. An observing urchin and a rogue, he made a potpourri of\nthe voices of nature and the voices of Paris. He combined the repertory\nof the birds with the repertory of the workshops. He was acquainted with\nthieves, a tribe contiguous to his own. He had, it appears, been\nfor three months apprenticed to a printer. He had one day executed a\ncommission for M. Baour-Lormian, one of the Forty. Gavroche was a gamin\nof letters.\n\nMoreover, Gavroche had no suspicion of the fact that when he had offered\nthe hospitality of his elephant to two brats on that villainously\nrainy night, it was to his own brothers that he had played the part of\nProvidence. His brothers in the evening, his father in the morning;\nthat is what his night had been like. On quitting the Rue des Ballets\nat daybreak, he had returned in haste to the elephant, had artistically\nextracted from it the two brats, had shared with them some sort of\nbreakfast which he had invented, and had then gone away, confiding\nthem to that good mother, the street, who had brought him up, almost\nentirely. On leaving them, he had appointed to meet them at the same\nspot in the evening, and had left them this discourse by way of a\nfarewell: \"I break a cane, otherwise expressed, I cut my stick, or, as\nthey say at the court, I file off. If you don't find papa and mamma,\nyoung 'uns, come back here this evening. I'll scramble you up some\nsupper, and I'll give you a shakedown.\" The two children, picked up by\nsome policeman and placed in the refuge, or stolen by some mountebank,\nor having simply strayed off in that immense Chinese puzzle of a Paris,\ndid not return. The lowest depths of the actual social world are full of\nthese lost traces. Gavroche did not see them again. Ten or twelve weeks\nhad elapsed since that night. More than once he had scratched the back\nof his head and said: \"Where the devil are my two children?\"\n\nIn the meantime, he had arrived, pistol in hand, in the Rue du\nPont-aux-Choux. He noticed that there was but one shop open in that\nstreet, and, a matter worthy of reflection, that was a pastry-cook's\nshop. This presented a providential occasion to eat another\napple-turnover before entering the unknown. Gavroche halted, fumbled in\nhis fob, turned his pocket inside out, found nothing, not even a sou,\nand began to shout: \"Help!\"\n\nIt is hard to miss the last cake.\n\nNevertheless, Gavroche pursued his way.\n\nTwo minutes later he was in the Rue Saint-Louis. While traversing the\nRue du Parc-Royal, he felt called upon to make good the loss of the\napple-turnover which had been impossible, and he indulged himself in the\nimmense delight of tearing down the theatre posters in broad daylight.\n\nA little further on, on catching sight of a group of comfortable-looking\npersons, who seemed to be landed proprietors, he shrugged his shoulders\nand spit out at random before him this mouthful of philosophical bile as\nthey passed:\n\n\"How fat those moneyed men are! They're drunk! They just wallow in good\ndinners. Ask 'em what they do with their money. They don't know. They\neat it, that's what they do! As much as their bellies will hold.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II--GAVROCHE ON THE MARCH\n\nThe brandishing of a triggerless pistol, grasped in one's hand in the\nopen street, is so much of a public function that Gavroche felt his\nfervor increasing with every moment. Amid the scraps of the Marseillaise\nwhich he was singing, he shouted:--\n\n\"All goes well. I suffer a great deal in my left paw, I'm all broken\nup with rheumatism, but I'm satisfied, citizens. All that the bourgeois\nhave to do is to bear themselves well, I'll sneeze them out subversive\ncouplets. What are the police spies? Dogs. And I'd just like to have\none of them at the end of my pistol. I'm just from the boulevard, my\nfriends. It's getting hot there, it's getting into a little boil, it's\nsimmering. It's time to skim the pot. Forward march, men! Let an impure\nblood inundate the furrows! I give my days to my country, I shall never\nsee my concubine more, Nini, finished, yes, Nini? But never mind! Long\nlive joy! Let's fight, crebleu! I've had enough of despotism.\"\n\nAt that moment, the horse of a lancer of the National Guard having\nfallen, Gavroche laid his pistol on the pavement, and picked up the\nman, then he assisted in raising the horse. After which he picked up his\npistol and resumed his way. In the Rue de Thorigny, all was peace and\nsilence. This apathy, peculiar to the Marais, presented a contrast with\nthe vast surrounding uproar. Four gossips were chatting in a doorway.\n\nScotland has trios of witches, Paris has quartettes of old gossiping\nhags; and the \"Thou shalt be King\" could be quite as mournfully hurled\nat Bonaparte in the Carrefour Baudoyer as at Macbeth on the heath of\nArmuyr. The croak would be almost identical.\n\nThe gossips of the Rue de Thorigny busied themselves only with their own\nconcerns. Three of them were portresses, and the fourth was a rag-picker\nwith her basket on her back.\n\nAll four of them seemed to be standing at the four corners of old age,\nwhich are decrepitude, decay, ruin, and sadness.\n\nThe rag-picker was humble. In this open-air society, it is the\nrag-picker who salutes and the portress who patronizes. This is caused\nby the corner for refuse, which is fat or lean, according to the will of\nthe portresses, and after the fancy of the one who makes the heap. There\nmay be kindness in the broom.\n\nThis rag-picker was a grateful creature, and she smiled, with what a\nsmile! on the three portresses. Things of this nature were said:--\n\n\"Ah, by the way, is your cat still cross?\"\n\n\"Good gracious, cats are naturally the enemies of dogs, you know. It's\nthe dogs who complain.\"\n\n\"And people also.\"\n\n\"But the fleas from a cat don't go after people.\"\n\n\"That's not the trouble, dogs are dangerous. I remember one year\nwhen there were so many dogs that it was necessary to put it in the\nnewspapers. That was at the time when there were at the Tuileries great\nsheep that drew the little carriage of the King of Rome. Do you remember\nthe King of Rome?\"\n\n\"I liked the Duc de Bordeau better.\"\n\n\"I knew Louis XVIII. I prefer Louis XVIII.\"\n\n\"Meat is awfully dear, isn't it, Mother Patagon?\"\n\n\"Ah! don't mention it, the butcher's shop is a horror. A horrible\nhorror--one can't afford anything but the poor cuts nowadays.\"\n\nHere the rag-picker interposed:--\n\n\"Ladies, business is dull. The refuse heaps are miserable. No one throws\nanything away any more. They eat everything.\"\n\n\"There are poorer people than you, la Vargouleme.\"\n\n\"Ah, that's true,\" replied the rag-picker, with deference, \"I have a\nprofession.\"\n\nA pause succeeded, and the rag-picker, yielding to that necessity for\nboasting which lies at the bottom of man, added:--\n\n\"In the morning, on my return home, I pick over my basket, I sort my\nthings. This makes heaps in my room. I put the rags in a basket, the\ncores and stalks in a bucket, the linen in my cupboard, the woollen\nstuff in my commode, the old papers in the corner of the window,\nthe things that are good to eat in my bowl, the bits of glass in my\nfireplace, the old shoes behind my door, and the bones under my bed.\"\n\nGavroche had stopped behind her and was listening.\n\n\"Old ladies,\" said he, \"what do you mean by talking politics?\"\n\nHe was assailed by a broadside, composed of a quadruple howl.\n\n\"Here's another rascal.\"\n\n\"What's that he's got in his paddle? A pistol?\"\n\n\"Well, I'd like to know what sort of a beggar's brat this is?\"\n\n\"That sort of animal is never easy unless he's overturning the\nauthorities.\"\n\nGavroche disdainfully contented himself, by way of reprisal, with\nelevating the tip of his nose with his thumb and opening his hand wide.\n\nThe rag-picker cried:--\n\n\"You malicious, bare-pawed little wretch!\"\n\nThe one who answered to the name of Patagon clapped her hands together\nin horror.\n\n\"There's going to be evil doings, that's certain. The errand-boy next\ndoor has a little pointed beard, I have seen him pass every day with a\nyoung person in a pink bonnet on his arm; to-day I saw him pass, and\nhe had a gun on his arm. Mame Bacheux says, that last week there was a\nrevolution at--at--at--where's the calf!--at Pontoise. And then, there\nyou see him, that horrid scamp, with his pistol! It seems that the\nCelestins are full of pistols. What do you suppose the Government can\ndo with good-for-nothings who don't know how to do anything but contrive\nways of upsetting the world, when we had just begun to get a little\nquiet after all the misfortunes that have happened, good Lord! to that\npoor queen whom I saw pass in the tumbril! And all this is going to\nmake tobacco dearer. It's infamous! And I shall certainly go to see him\nbeheaded on the guillotine, the wretch!\"\n\n\"You've got the sniffles, old lady,\" said Gavroche. \"Blow your\npromontory.\"\n\nAnd he passed on. When he was in the Rue Pavee, the rag-picker occurred\nto his mind, and he indulged in this soliloquy:--\n\n\"You're in the wrong to insult the revolutionists, Mother\nDust-Heap-Corner. This pistol is in your interests. It's so that you may\nhave more good things to eat in your basket.\"\n\nAll at once, he heard a shout behind him; it was the portress Patagon\nwho had followed him, and who was shaking her fist at him in the\ndistance and crying:--\n\n\"You're nothing but a bastard.\"\n\n\"Oh! Come now,\" said Gavroche, \"I don't care a brass farthing for that!\"\n\nShortly afterwards, he passed the Hotel Lamoignon. There he uttered this\nappeal:--\n\n\"Forward march to the battle!\"\n\nAnd he was seized with a fit of melancholy. He gazed at his pistol with\nan air of reproach which seemed an attempt to appease it:--\n\n\"I'm going off,\" said he, \"but you won't go off!\"\n\nOne dog may distract the attention from another dog.[45] A very gaunt\npoodle came along at the moment. Gavroche felt compassion for him.\n\n\"My poor doggy,\" said he, \"you must have gone and swallowed a cask, for\nall the hoops are visible.\"\n\nThen he directed his course towards l'Orme-Saint-Gervais.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III--JUST INDIGNATION OF A HAIR-DRESSER\n\nThe worthy hair-dresser who had chased from his shop the two little\nfellows to whom Gavroche had opened the paternal interior of the\nelephant was at that moment in his shop engaged in shaving an old\nsoldier of the legion who had served under the Empire. They were\ntalking. The hair-dresser had, naturally, spoken to the veteran of the\nriot, then of General Lamarque, and from Lamarque they had passed to\nthe Emperor. Thence sprang up a conversation between barber and\nsoldier which Prudhomme, had he been present, would have enriched with\narabesques, and which he would have entitled: \"Dialogue between the\nrazor and the sword.\"\n\n\"How did the Emperor ride, sir?\" said the barber.\n\n\"Badly. He did not know how to fall--so he never fell.\"\n\n\"Did he have fine horses? He must have had fine horses!\"\n\n\"On the day when he gave me my cross, I noticed his beast. It was a\nracing mare, perfectly white. Her ears were very wide apart, her saddle\ndeep, a fine head marked with a black star, a very long neck, strongly\narticulated knees, prominent ribs, oblique shoulders and a powerful\ncrupper. A little more than fifteen hands in height.\"\n\n\"A pretty horse,\" remarked the hair-dresser.\n\n\"It was His Majesty's beast.\"\n\nThe hair-dresser felt, that after this observation, a short silence\nwould be fitting, so he conformed himself to it, and then went on:--\n\n\"The Emperor was never wounded but once, was he, sir?\"\n\nThe old soldier replied with the calm and sovereign tone of a man who\nhad been there:--\n\n\"In the heel. At Ratisbon. I never saw him so well dressed as on that\nday. He was as neat as a new sou.\"\n\n\"And you, Mr. Veteran, you must have been often wounded?\"\n\n\"I?\" said the soldier, \"ah! not to amount to anything. At Marengo, I\nreceived two sabre-blows on the back of my neck, a bullet in the right\narm at Austerlitz, another in the left hip at Jena. At Friedland,\na thrust from a bayonet, there,--at the Moskowa seven or eight\nlance-thrusts, no matter where, at Lutzen a splinter of a shell crushed\none of my fingers. Ah! and then at Waterloo, a ball from a biscaien in\nthe thigh, that's all.\"\n\n\"How fine that is!\" exclaimed the hair-dresser, in Pindaric accents, \"to\ndie on the field of battle! On my word of honor, rather than die in bed,\nof an illness, slowly, a bit by bit each day, with drugs, cataplasms,\nsyringes, medicines, I should prefer to receive a cannon-ball in my\nbelly!\"\n\n\"You're not over fastidious,\" said the soldier.\n\nHe had hardly spoken when a fearful crash shook the shop. The\nshow-window had suddenly been fractured.\n\nThe wig-maker turned pale.\n\n\"Ah, good God!\" he exclaimed, \"it's one of them!\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"A cannon-ball.\"\n\n\"Here it is,\" said the soldier.\n\nAnd he picked up something that was rolling about the floor. It was a\npebble.\n\nThe hair-dresser ran to the broken window and beheld Gavroche fleeing\nat the full speed, towards the Marche Saint-Jean. As he passed the\nhair-dresser's shop Gavroche, who had the two brats still in his mind,\nhad not been able to resist the impulse to say good day to him, and had\nflung a stone through his panes.\n\n\"You see!\" shrieked the hair-dresser, who from white had turned blue,\n\"that fellow returns and does mischief for the pure pleasure of it. What\nhas any one done to that gamin?\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV--THE CHILD IS AMAZED AT THE OLD MAN\n\nIn the meantime, in the Marche Saint-Jean, where the post had already\nbeen disarmed, Gavroche had just \"effected a junction\" with a band led\nby Enjolras, Courfeyrac, Combeferre, and Feuilly. They were armed after\na fashion. Bahorel and Jean Prouvaire had found them and swelled the\ngroup. Enjolras had a double-barrelled hunting-gun, Combeferre the gun\nof a National Guard bearing the number of his legion, and in his belt,\ntwo pistols which his unbuttoned coat allowed to be seen, Jean Prouvaire\nan old cavalry musket, Bahorel a rifle; Courfeyrac was brandishing an\nunsheathed sword-cane. Feuilly, with a naked sword in his hand, marched\nat their head shouting: \"Long live Poland!\"\n\nThey reached the Quai Morland. Cravatless, hatless, breathless, soaked\nby the rain, with lightning in their eyes. Gavroche accosted them\ncalmly:--\n\n\"Where are we going?\"\n\n\"Come along,\" said Courfeyrac.\n\nBehind Feuilly marched, or rather bounded, Bahorel, who was like a fish\nin water in a riot. He wore a scarlet waistcoat, and indulged in\nthe sort of words which break everything. His waistcoat astounded a\npasser-by, who cried in bewilderment:--\n\n\"Here are the reds!\"\n\n\"The reds, the reds!\" retorted Bahorel. \"A queer kind of fear,\nbourgeois. For my part I don't tremble before a poppy, the little red\nhat inspires me with no alarm. Take my advice, bourgeois, let's leave\nfear of the red to horned cattle.\"\n\nHe caught sight of a corner of the wall on which was placarded the\nmost peaceable sheet of paper in the world, a permission to eat eggs, a\nLenten admonition addressed by the Archbishop of Paris to his \"flock.\"\n\nBahorel exclaimed:--\n\n\"'Flock'; a polite way of saying geese.\"\n\nAnd he tore the charge from the nail. This conquered Gavroche. From that\ninstant Gavroche set himself to study Bahorel.\n\n\"Bahorel,\" observed Enjolras, \"you are wrong. You should have let that\ncharge alone, he is not the person with whom we have to deal, you are\nwasting your wrath to no purpose. Take care of your supply. One does not\nfire out of the ranks with the soul any more than with a gun.\"\n\n\"Each one in his own fashion, Enjolras,\" retorted Bahorel. \"This\nbishop's prose shocks me; I want to eat eggs without being permitted.\nYour style is the hot and cold; I am amusing myself. Besides, I'm not\nwasting myself, I'm getting a start; and if I tore down that charge,\nHercle! 'twas only to whet my appetite.\"\n\nThis word, Hercle, struck Gavroche. He sought all occasions for\nlearning, and that tearer-down of posters possessed his esteem. He\ninquired of him:--\n\n\"What does Hercle mean?\"\n\nBahorel answered:--\n\n\"It means cursed name of a dog, in Latin.\"\n\nHere Bahorel recognized at a window a pale young man with a black beard\nwho was watching them as they passed, probably a Friend of the A B C. He\nshouted to him:--\n\n\"Quick, cartridges, para bellum.\"\n\n\"A fine man! that's true,\" said Gavroche, who now understood Latin.\n\nA tumultuous retinue accompanied them,--students, artists, young men\naffiliated to the Cougourde of Aix, artisans, longshoremen, armed with\nclubs and bayonets; some, like Combeferre, with pistols thrust into\ntheir trousers.\n\nAn old man, who appeared to be extremely aged, was walking in the band.\n\nHe had no arms, and he made great haste, so that he might not be left\nbehind, although he had a thoughtful air.\n\nGavroche caught sight of him:--\n\n\"Keksekca?\" said he to Courfeyrac.\n\n\"He's an old duffer.\"\n\nIt was M. Mabeuf.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V--THE OLD MAN\n\nLet us recount what had taken place.\n\nEnjolras and his friends had been on the Boulevard Bourdon, near the\npublic storehouses, at the moment when the dragoons had made their\ncharge. Enjolras, Courfeyrac, and Combeferre were among those who had\ntaken to the Rue Bassompierre, shouting: \"To the barricades!\" In the Rue\nLesdiguieres they had met an old man walking along. What had attracted\ntheir attention was that the goodman was walking in a zig-zag, as though\nhe were intoxicated. Moreover, he had his hat in his hand, although it\nhad been raining all the morning, and was raining pretty briskly at the\nvery time. Courfeyrac had recognized Father Mabeuf. He knew him through\nhaving many times accompanied Marius as far as his door. As he was\nacquainted with the peaceful and more than timid habits of the old\nbeadle-book-collector, and was amazed at the sight of him in the midst\nof that uproar, a couple of paces from the cavalry charges, almost in\nthe midst of a fusillade, hatless in the rain, and strolling about among\nthe bullets, he had accosted him, and the following dialogue had been\nexchanged between the rioter of fire and the octogenarian:--\n\n\"M. Mabeuf, go to your home.\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"There's going to be a row.\"\n\n\"That's well.\"\n\n\"Thrusts with the sword and firing, M. Mabeuf.\"\n\n\"That is well.\"\n\n\"Firing from cannon.\"\n\n\"That is good. Where are the rest of you going?\"\n\n\"We are going to fling the government to the earth.\"\n\n\"That is good.\"\n\nAnd he had set out to follow them. From that moment forth he had not\nuttered a word. His step had suddenly become firm; artisans had offered\nhim their arms; he had refused with a sign of the head. He advanced\nnearly to the front rank of the column, with the movement of a man who\nis marching and the countenance of a man who is sleeping.\n\n\"What a fierce old fellow!\" muttered the students. The rumor spread\nthrough the troop that he was a former member of the Convention,--an old\nregicide. The mob had turned in through the Rue de la Verrerie.\n\nLittle Gavroche marched in front with that deafening song which made of\nhim a sort of trumpet.\n\nHe sang:       \"Voici la lune qui paratt,\n        Quand irons-nous dans la foret?\n        Demandait Charlot a Charlotte.\n\n             Tou tou tou\n             Pour Chatou.\n        Je n'ai qu'un Dieu, qu'un roi, qu'un liard, et qu'une botte.\n\n        \"Pour avoir bu de grand matin\n         La rosee a meme le thym,\n         Deux moineaux etaient en ribotte.\n\n             Zi zi zi\n             Pour Passy.\n        Je n'ai qu'un Dieu, qu'un roi, qu'un liard, et qu'une botte.\n\n       \"Et ces deux pauvres petits loups,\n        Comme deux grives estaient souls;\n        Une tigre en riait dans sa grotte.\n\n             Don don don\n             Pour Meudon.\n        Je n'ai qu'un Dieu, qu'un roi, qu'un liard, et qu'une botte.\n\n       \"L'un jurait et l'autre sacrait.\n        Quand irons nous dans la foret?\n        Demandait Charlot a Charlotte.\n\n             Tin tin tin\n             Pour Pantin.\n         Je n'ai qu'un Dieu, qu'un roi, qu'un liard, et qu'une botte.\"[46]\n\nThey directed their course towards Saint-Merry.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI--RECRUITS\n\nThe band augmented every moment. Near the Rue des Billettes, a man of\nlofty stature, whose hair was turning gray, and whose bold and daring\nmien was remarked by Courfeyrac, Enjolras, and Combeferre, but whom\nnone of them knew, joined them. Gavroche, who was occupied in singing,\nwhistling, humming, running on ahead and pounding on the shutters of the\nshops with the butt of his triggerless pistol; paid no attention to this\nman.\n\nIt chanced that in the Rue de la Verrerie, they passed in front of\nCourfeyrac's door.\n\n\"This happens just right,\" said Courfeyrac, \"I have forgotten my purse,\nand I have lost my hat.\"\n\nHe quitted the mob and ran up to his quarters at full speed. He seized\nan old hat and his purse.\n\nHe also seized a large square coffer, of the dimensions of a large\nvalise, which was concealed under his soiled linen.\n\nAs he descended again at a run, the portress hailed him:--\n\n\"Monsieur de Courfeyrac!\"\n\n\"What's your name, portress?\"\n\nThe portress stood bewildered.\n\n\"Why, you know perfectly well, I'm the concierge; my name is Mother\nVeuvain.\"\n\n\"Well, if you call me Monsieur de Courfeyrac again, I shall call you\nMother de Veuvain. Now speak, what's the matter? What do you want?\"\n\n\"There is some one who wants to speak with you.\"\n\n\"Who is it?\"\n\n\"I don't know.\"\n\n\"Where is he?\"\n\n\"In my lodge.\"\n\n\"The devil!\" ejaculated Courfeyrac.\n\n\"But the person has been waiting your return for over an hour,\" said the\nportress.\n\nAt the same time, a sort of pale, thin, small, freckled, and youthful\nartisan, clad in a tattered blouse and patched trousers of ribbed\nvelvet, and who had rather the air of a girl accoutred as a man than of\na man, emerged from the lodge and said to Courfeyrac in a voice which\nwas not the least in the world like a woman's voice:--\n\n\"Monsieur Marius, if you please.\"\n\n\"He is not here.\"\n\n\"Will he return this evening?\"\n\n\"I know nothing about it.\"\n\nAnd Courfeyrac added:--\n\n\"For my part, I shall not return.\"\n\nThe young man gazed steadily at him and said:--\n\n\"Why not?\"\n\n\"Because.\"\n\n\"Where are you going, then?\"\n\n\"What business is that of yours?\"\n\n\"Would you like to have me carry your coffer for you?\"\n\n\"I am going to the barricades.\"\n\n\"Would you like to have me go with you?\"\n\n\"If you like!\" replied Courfeyrac. \"The street is free, the pavements\nbelong to every one.\"\n\nAnd he made his escape at a run to join his friends. When he had\nrejoined them, he gave the coffer to one of them to carry. It was only\na quarter of an hour after this that he saw the young man, who had\nactually followed them.\n\nA mob does not go precisely where it intends. We have explained that\na gust of wind carries it away. They overshot Saint-Merry and found\nthemselves, without precisely knowing how, in the Rue Saint-Denis.\n\n\n\n\nBOOK TWELFTH.--CORINTHE\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I--HISTORY OF CORINTHE FROM ITS FOUNDATION\n\nThe Parisians who nowadays on entering on the Rue Rambuteau at the end\nnear the Halles, notice on their right, opposite the Rue Mondetour, a\nbasket-maker's shop having for its sign a basket in the form of Napoleon\nthe Great with this inscription:--\n\n                    NAPOLEON IS MADE\n                    WHOLLY OF WILLOW,\n\nhave no suspicion of the terrible scenes which this very spot witnessed\nhardly thirty years ago.\n\nIt was there that lay the Rue de la Chanvrerie, which ancient deeds\nspell Chanverrerie, and the celebrated public-house called Corinthe.\n\nThe reader will remember all that has been said about the barricade\neffected at this point, and eclipsed, by the way, by the barricade\nSaint-Merry. It was on this famous barricade of the Rue de la\nChanvrerie, now fallen into profound obscurity, that we are about to\nshed a little light.\n\nMay we be permitted to recur, for the sake of clearness in the recital,\nto the simple means which we have already employed in the case of\nWaterloo. Persons who wish to picture to themselves in a tolerably exact\nmanner the constitution of the houses which stood at that epoch near the\nPointe Saint-Eustache, at the northeast angle of the Halles of Paris,\nwhere to-day lies the embouchure of the Rue Rambuteau, have only to\nimagine an N touching the Rue Saint-Denis with its summit and the Halles\nwith its base, and whose two vertical bars should form the Rue de la\nGrande-Truanderie, and the Rue de la Chanvrerie, and whose transverse\nbar should be formed by the Rue de la Petite-Truanderie. The old Rue\nMondetour cut the three strokes of the N at the most crooked angles,\nso that the labyrinthine confusion of these four streets sufficed to\nform, on a space three fathoms square, between the Halles and the Rue\nSaint-Denis on the one hand, and between the Rue du Cygne and the Rue\ndes Precheurs on the other, seven islands of houses, oddly cut up, of\nvarying sizes, placed crosswise and hap-hazard, and barely separated,\nlike the blocks of stone in a dock, by narrow crannies.\n\nWe say narrow crannies, and we can give no more just idea of those dark,\ncontracted, many-angled alleys, lined with eight-story buildings. These\nbuildings were so decrepit that, in the Rue de la Chanvrerie and the Rue\nde la Petite-Truanderie, the fronts were shored up with beams running\nfrom one house to another. The street was narrow and the gutter broad,\nthe pedestrian there walked on a pavement that was always wet, skirting\nlittle stalls resembling cellars, big posts encircled with iron hoops,\nexcessive heaps of refuse, and gates armed with enormous, century-old\ngratings. The Rue Rambuteau has devastated all that.\n\nThe name of Mondetour paints marvellously well the sinuosities of that\nwhole set of streets. A little further on, they are found still better\nexpressed by the Rue Pirouette, which ran into the Rue Mondetour.\n\nThe passer-by who got entangled from the Rue Saint-Denis in the Rue de\nla Chanvrerie beheld it gradually close in before him as though he had\nentered an elongated funnel. At the end of this street, which was very\nshort, he found further passage barred in the direction of the Halles\nby a tall row of houses, and he would have thought himself in a blind\nalley, had he not perceived on the right and left two dark cuts through\nwhich he could make his escape. This was the Rue Mondetour, which on\none side ran into the Rue de Precheurs, and on the other into the Rue\ndu Cygne and the Petite-Truanderie. At the bottom of this sort of\ncul-de-sac, at the angle of the cutting on the right, there was to be\nseen a house which was not so tall as the rest, and which formed a sort\nof cape in the street. It is in this house, of two stories only, that\nan illustrious wine-shop had been merrily installed three hundred years\nbefore. This tavern created a joyous noise in the very spot which old\nTheophilus described in the following couplet:--\n\n               La branle le squelette horrible\n               D'un pauvre amant qui se pendit.[47]\n\n\nThe situation was good, and tavern-keepers succeeded each other there,\nfrom father to son.\n\nIn the time of Mathurin Regnier, this cabaret was called the\nPot-aux-Roses, and as the rebus was then in fashion, it had for its\nsign-board, a post (poteau) painted rose-color. In the last century, the\nworthy Natoire, one of the fantastic masters nowadays despised by the\nstiff school, having got drunk many times in this wine-shop at the\nvery table where Regnier had drunk his fill, had painted, by way of\ngratitude, a bunch of Corinth grapes on the pink post. The keeper of the\ncabaret, in his joy, had changed his device and had caused to be placed\nin gilt letters beneath the bunch these words: \"At the Bunch of Corinth\nGrapes\" (\"Au Raisin de Corinthe\"). Hence the name of Corinthe. Nothing\nis more natural to drunken men than ellipses. The ellipsis is the\nzig-zag of the phrase. Corinthe gradually dethroned the Pot-aux-Roses.\nThe last proprietor of the dynasty, Father Hucheloup, no longer\nacquainted even with the tradition, had the post painted blue.\n\nA room on the ground floor, where the bar was situated, one on the first\nfloor containing a billiard-table, a wooden spiral staircase piercing\nthe ceiling, wine on the tables, smoke on the walls, candles in broad\ndaylight,--this was the style of this cabaret. A staircase with a\ntrap-door in the lower room led to the cellar. On the second floor were\nthe lodgings of the Hucheloup family. They were reached by a staircase\nwhich was a ladder rather than a staircase, and had for their entrance\nonly a private door in the large room on the first floor. Under the\nroof, in two mansard attics, were the nests for the servants. The\nkitchen shared the ground-floor with the tap-room.\n\nFather Hucheloup had, possibly, been born a chemist, but the fact is\nthat he was a cook; people did not confine themselves to drinking alone\nin his wine-shop, they also ate there. Hucheloup had invented a capital\nthing which could be eaten nowhere but in his house, stuffed carps,\nwhich he called carpes au gras. These were eaten by the light of a\ntallow candle or of a lamp of the time of Louis XVI., on tables to which\nwere nailed waxed cloths in lieu of table-cloths. People came thither\nfrom a distance. Hucheloup, one fine morning, had seen fit to notify\npassers-by of this \"specialty\"; he had dipped a brush in a pot of black\npaint, and as he was an orthographer on his own account, as well as\na cook after his own fashion, he had improvised on his wall this\nremarkable inscription:--\n\n                    CARPES HO GRAS.\n\n\nOne winter, the rain-storms and the showers had taken a fancy to\nobliterate the S which terminated the first word, and the G which began\nthe third; this is what remained:--\n\n                      CARPE HO RAS.\n\n\nTime and rain assisting, a humble gastronomical announcement had become\na profound piece of advice.\n\nIn this way it came about, that though he knew no French, Father\nHucheloup understood Latin, that he had evoked philosophy from his\nkitchen, and that, desirous simply of effacing Lent, he had equalled\nHorace. And the striking thing about it was, that that also meant:\n\"Enter my wine-shop.\"\n\nNothing of all this is in existence now. The Mondetour labyrinth was\ndisembowelled and widely opened in 1847, and probably no longer exists\nat the present moment. The Rue de la Chanvrerie and Corinthe have\ndisappeared beneath the pavement of the Rue Rambuteau.\n\nAs we have already said, Corinthe was the meeting-place if not the\nrallying-point, of Courfeyrac and his friends. It was Grantaire who had\ndiscovered Corinthe. He had entered it on account of the Carpe horas,\nand had returned thither on account of the Carpes au gras. There they\ndrank, there they ate, there they shouted; they did not pay much, they\npaid badly, they did not pay at all, but they were always welcome.\nFather Hucheloup was a jovial host.\n\nHucheloup, that amiable man, as was just said, was a wine-shop-keeper\nwith a mustache; an amusing variety. He always had an ill-tempered air,\nseemed to wish to intimidate his customers, grumbled at the people who\nentered his establishment, and had rather the mien of seeking a quarrel\nwith them than of serving them with soup. And yet, we insist upon\nthe word, people were always welcome there. This oddity had attracted\ncustomers to his shop, and brought him young men, who said to each\nother: \"Come hear Father Hucheloup growl.\" He had been a fencing-master.\nAll of a sudden, he would burst out laughing. A big voice, a good\nfellow. He had a comic foundation under a tragic exterior, he asked\nnothing better than to frighten you, very much like those snuff-boxes\nwhich are in the shape of a pistol. The detonation makes one sneeze.\n\nMother Hucheloup, his wife, was a bearded and a very homely creature.\n\nAbout 1830, Father Hucheloup died. With him disappeared the secret of\nstuffed carps. His inconsolable widow continued to keep the wine-shop.\nBut the cooking deteriorated, and became execrable; the wine, which had\nalways been bad, became fearfully bad. Nevertheless, Courfeyrac and his\nfriends continued to go to Corinthe,--out of pity, as Bossuet said.\n\nThe Widow Hucheloup was breathless and misshapen and given to rustic\nrecollections. She deprived them of their flatness by her pronunciation.\nShe had a way of her own of saying things, which spiced her\nreminiscences of the village and of her springtime. It had formerly been\nher delight, so she affirmed, to hear the loups-de-gorge (rouges-gorges)\nchanter dans les ogrepines (aubepines)--to hear the redbreasts sing in\nthe hawthorn-trees.\n\nThe hall on the first floor, where \"the restaurant\" was situated, was\na large and long apartment encumbered with stools, chairs, benches, and\ntables, and with a crippled, lame, old billiard-table. It was reached\nby a spiral staircase which terminated in the corner of the room at a\nsquare hole like the hatchway of a ship.\n\nThis room, lighted by a single narrow window, and by a lamp that was\nalways burning, had the air of a garret. All the four-footed furniture\ncomported itself as though it had but three legs--the whitewashed walls\nhad for their only ornament the following quatrain in honor of Mame\nHucheloup:--\n\n          Elle etonne a dix pas, elle epouvente a deux,\n          Une verrue habite en son nez hasardeux;\n          On tremble a chaque instant qu'elle ne vous la mouche\n          Et qu'un beau jour son nez ne tombe dans sa bouche.[48]\n\n\nThis was scrawled in charcoal on the wall.\n\nMame Hucheloup, a good likeness, went and came from morning till\nnight before this quatrain with the most perfect tranquillity. Two\nserving-maids, named Matelote and Gibelotte,[49] and who had never been\nknown by any other names, helped Mame Hucheloup to set on the tables\nthe jugs of poor wine, and the various broths which were served to the\nhungry patrons in earthenware bowls. Matelote, large, plump, redhaired,\nand noisy, the favorite ex-sultana of the defunct Hucheloup, was\nhomelier than any mythological monster, be it what it may; still, as it\nbecomes the servant to always keep in the rear of the mistress, she was\nless homely than Mame Hucheloup. Gibelotte, tall, delicate, white with a\nlymphatic pallor, with circles round her eyes, and drooping lids, always\nlanguid and weary, afflicted with what may be called chronic lassitude,\nthe first up in the house and the last in bed, waited on every one, even\nthe other maid, silently and gently, smiling through her fatigue with a\nvague and sleepy smile.\n\nBefore entering the restaurant room, the visitor read on the door the\nfollowing line written there in chalk by Courfeyrac:--\n\n          Regale si tu peux et mange si tu l'oses.[50]\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II--PRELIMINARY GAYETIES\n\nLaigle de Meaux, as the reader knows, lived more with Joly than\nelsewhere. He had a lodging, as a bird has one on a branch. The\ntwo friends lived together, ate together, slept together. They had\neverything in common, even Musichetta, to some extent. They were, what\nthe subordinate monks who accompany monks are called, bini. On the\nmorning of the 5th of June, they went to Corinthe to breakfast. Joly,\nwho was all stuffed up, had a catarrh which Laigle was beginning to\nshare. Laigle's coat was threadbare, but Joly was well dressed.\n\nIt was about nine o'clock in the morning, when they opened the door of\nCorinthe.\n\nThey ascended to the first floor.\n\nMatelote and Gibelotte received them.\n\n\"Oysters, cheese, and ham,\" said Laigle.\n\nAnd they seated themselves at a table.\n\nThe wine-shop was empty; there was no one there but themselves.\n\nGibelotte, knowing Joly and Laigle, set a bottle of wine on the table.\n\nWhile they were busy with their first oysters, a head appeared at the\nhatchway of the staircase, and a voice said:--\n\n\"I am passing by. I smell from the street a delicious odor of Brie\ncheese. I enter.\" It was Grantaire.\n\nGrantaire took a stool and drew up to the table.\n\nAt the sight of Grantaire, Gibelotte placed two bottles of wine on the\ntable.\n\nThat made three.\n\n\"Are you going to drink those two bottles?\" Laigle inquired of\nGrantaire.\n\nGrantaire replied:--\n\n\"All are ingenious, thou alone art ingenuous. Two bottles never yet\nastonished a man.\"\n\nThe others had begun by eating, Grantaire began by drinking. Half a\nbottle was rapidly gulped down.\n\n\"So you have a hole in your stomach?\" began Laigle again.\n\n\"You have one in your elbow,\" said Grantaire.\n\nAnd after having emptied his glass, he added:--\n\n\"Ah, by the way, Laigle of the funeral oration, your coat is old.\"\n\n\"I should hope so,\" retorted Laigle. \"That's why we get on well\ntogether, my coat and I. It has acquired all my folds, it does not bind\nme anywhere, it is moulded on my deformities, it falls in with all my\nmovements, I am only conscious of it because it keeps me warm. Old coats\nare just like old friends.\"\n\n\"That's true,\" ejaculated Joly, striking into the dialogue, \"an old goat\nis an old abi\" (ami, friend).\n\n\"Especially in the mouth of a man whose head is stuffed up,\" said\nGrantaire.\n\n\"Grantaire,\" demanded Laigle, \"have you just come from the boulevard?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"We have just seen the head of the procession pass, Joly and I.\"\n\n\"It's a marvellous sight,\" said Joly.\n\n\"How quiet this street is!\" exclaimed Laigle. \"Who would suspect that\nParis was turned upside down? How plainly it is to be seen that in\nformer days there were nothing but convents here! In this neighborhood!\nDu Breul and Sauval give a list of them, and so does the Abbe Lebeuf.\nThey were all round here, they fairly swarmed, booted and barefooted,\nshaven, bearded, gray, black, white, Franciscans, Minims, Capuchins,\nCarmelites, Little Augustines, Great Augustines, old Augustines--there\nwas no end of them.\"\n\n\"Don't let's talk of monks,\" interrupted Grantaire, \"it makes one want\nto scratch one's self.\"\n\nThen he exclaimed:--\n\n\"Bouh! I've just swallowed a bad oyster. Now hypochondria is taking\npossession of me again. The oysters are spoiled, the servants are ugly.\nI hate the human race. I just passed through the Rue Richelieu, in front\nof the big public library. That pile of oyster-shells which is called\na library is disgusting even to think of. What paper! What ink! What\nscrawling! And all that has been written! What rascal was it who said\nthat man was a featherless biped?[51] And then, I met a pretty girl of\nmy acquaintance, who is as beautiful as the spring, worthy to be called\nFloreal, and who is delighted, enraptured, as happy as the angels,\nbecause a wretch yesterday, a frightful banker all spotted with\nsmall-pox, deigned to take a fancy to her! Alas! woman keeps on the\nwatch for a protector as much as for a lover; cats chase mice as well\nas birds. Two months ago that young woman was virtuous in an attic, she\nadjusted little brass rings in the eyelet-holes of corsets, what do\nyou call it? She sewed, she had a camp bed, she dwelt beside a pot\nof flowers, she was contented. Now here she is a bankeress. This\ntransformation took place last night. I met the victim this morning in\nhigh spirits. The hideous point about it is, that the jade is as pretty\nto-day as she was yesterday. Her financier did not show in her face.\nRoses have this advantage or disadvantage over women, that the traces\nleft upon them by caterpillars are visible. Ah! there is no morality on\nearth. I call to witness the myrtle, the symbol of love, the laurel,\nthe symbol of air, the olive, that ninny, the symbol of peace, the\napple-tree which came nearest rangling Adam with its pips, and the\nfig-tree, the grandfather of petticoats. As for right, do you know what\nright is? The Gauls covet Clusium, Rome protects Clusium, and demands\nwhat wrong Clusium has done to them. Brennus answers: 'The wrong that\nAlba did to you, the wrong that Fidenae did to you, the wrong that the\nEques, the Volsci, and the Sabines have done to you. They were your\nneighbors. The Clusians are ours. We understand neighborliness just as\nyou do. You have stolen Alba, we shall take Clusium.' Rome said: 'You\nshall not take Clusium.' Brennus took Rome. Then he cried: 'Vae victis!'\nThat is what right is. Ah! what beasts of prey there are in this world!\nWhat eagles! It makes my flesh creep.\"\n\nHe held out his glass to Joly, who filled it, then he drank and went on,\nhaving hardly been interrupted by this glass of wine, of which no one,\nnot even himself, had taken any notice:--\n\n\"Brennus, who takes Rome, is an eagle; the banker who takes the grisette\nis an eagle. There is no more modesty in the one case than in the other.\nSo we believe in nothing. There is but one reality: drink. Whatever your\nopinion may be in favor of the lean cock, like the Canton of Uri, or\nin favor of the fat cock, like the Canton of Glaris, it matters little,\ndrink. You talk to me of the boulevard, of that procession, et caetera,\net caetera. Come now, is there going to be another revolution? This\npoverty of means on the part of the good God astounds me. He has to keep\ngreasing the groove of events every moment. There is a hitch, it won't\nwork. Quick, a revolution! The good God has his hands perpetually black\nwith that cart-grease. If I were in his place, I'd be perfectly simple\nabout it, I would not wind up my mechanism every minute, I'd lead the\nhuman race in a straightforward way, I'd weave matters mesh by mesh,\nwithout breaking the thread, I would have no provisional arrangements,\nI would have no extraordinary repertory. What the rest of you call\nprogress advances by means of two motors, men and events. But, sad to\nsay, from time to time, the exceptional becomes necessary. The ordinary\ntroupe suffices neither for event nor for men: among men geniuses are\nrequired, among events revolutions. Great accidents are the law; the\norder of things cannot do without them; and, judging from the apparition\nof comets, one would be tempted to think that Heaven itself finds actors\nneeded for its performance. At the moment when one expects it the least,\nGod placards a meteor on the wall of the firmament. Some queer star\nturns up, underlined by an enormous tail. And that causes the death\nof Caesar. Brutus deals him a blow with a knife, and God a blow with a\ncomet. Crac, and behold an aurora borealis, behold a revolution, behold\na great man; '93 in big letters, Napoleon on guard, the comet of 1811\nat the head of the poster. Ah! what a beautiful blue theatre all studded\nwith unexpected flashes! Boum! Boum! extraordinary show! Raise your\neyes, boobies. Everything is in disorder, the star as well as the drama.\nGood God, it is too much and not enough. These resources, gathered from\nexception, seem magnificence and poverty. My friends, Providence has\ncome down to expedients. What does a revolution prove? That God is in a\nquandry. He effects a coup d'etat because he, God, has not been able to\nmake both ends meet. In fact, this confirms me in my conjectures as\nto Jehovah's fortune; and when I see so much distress in heaven and on\nearth, from the bird who has not a grain of millet to myself without a\nhundred thousand livres of income, when I see human destiny, which is\nvery badly worn, and even royal destiny, which is threadbare, witness\nthe Prince de Conde hung, when I see winter, which is nothing but a rent\nin the zenith through which the wind blows, when I see so many rags even\nin the perfectly new purple of the morning on the crests of hills, when\nI see the drops of dew, those mock pearls, when I see the frost, that\npaste, when I see humanity ripped apart and events patched up, and so\nmany spots on the sun and so many holes in the moon, when I see so\nmuch misery everywhere, I suspect that God is not rich. The appearance\nexists, it is true, but I feel that he is hard up. He gives a revolution\nas a tradesman whose money-box is empty gives a ball. God must not be\njudged from appearances. Beneath the gilding of heaven I perceive\na poverty-stricken universe. Creation is bankrupt. That is why I am\ndiscontented. Here it is the 4th of June, it is almost night; ever since\nthis morning I have been waiting for daylight to come; it has not come,\nand I bet that it won't come all day. This is the inexactness of an\nill-paid clerk. Yes, everything is badly arranged, nothing fits anything\nelse, this old world is all warped, I take my stand on the opposition,\neverything goes awry; the universe is a tease. It's like children, those\nwho want them have none, and those who don't want them have them. Total:\nI'm vexed. Besides, Laigle de Meaux, that bald-head, offends my sight.\nIt humiliates me to think that I am of the same age as that baldy.\nHowever, I criticise, but I do not insult. The universe is what it is.\nI speak here without evil intent and to ease my conscience. Receive,\nEternal Father, the assurance of my distinguished consideration. Ah!\nby all the saints of Olympus and by all the gods of paradise, I was not\nintended to be a Parisian, that is to say, to rebound forever, like a\nshuttlecock between two battledores, from the group of the loungers to\nthe group of the roysterers. I was made to be a Turk, watching oriental\nhouris all day long, executing those exquisite Egyptian dances, as\nsensuous as the dream of a chaste man, or a Beauceron peasant, or a\nVenetian gentleman surrounded by gentlewomen, or a petty German prince,\nfurnishing the half of a foot-soldier to the Germanic confederation, and\noccupying his leisure with drying his breeches on his hedge, that is to\nsay, his frontier. Those are the positions for which I was born! Yes, I\nhave said a Turk, and I will not retract. I do not understand how people\ncan habitually take Turks in bad part; Mohammed had his good points;\nrespect for the inventor of seraglios with houris and paradises with\nodalisques! Let us not insult Mohammedanism, the only religion which is\nornamented with a hen-roost! Now, I insist on a drink. The earth is a\ngreat piece of stupidity. And it appears that they are going to fight,\nall those imbeciles, and to break each other's profiles and to massacre\neach other in the heart of summer, in the month of June, when they might\ngo off with a creature on their arm, to breathe the immense heaps of\nnew-mown hay in the meadows! Really, people do commit altogether\ntoo many follies. An old broken lantern which I have just seen at a\nbric-a-brac merchant's suggests a reflection to my mind; it is time to\nenlighten the human race. Yes, behold me sad again. That's what comes\nof swallowing an oyster and a revolution the wrong way! I am growing\nmelancholy once more. Oh! frightful old world. People strive, turn each\nother out, prostitute themselves, kill each other, and get used to it!\"\n\nAnd Grantaire, after this fit of eloquence, had a fit of coughing, which\nwas well earned.\n\n\"A propos of revolution,\" said Joly, \"it is decidedly abberent that\nBarius is in lub.\"\n\n\"Does any one know with whom?\" demanded Laigle.\n\n\"Do.\"\n\n\"No?\"\n\n\"Do! I tell you.\"\n\n\"Marius' love affairs!\" exclaimed Grantaire. \"I can imagine it. Marius\nis a fog, and he must have found a vapor. Marius is of the race of\npoets. He who says poet, says fool, madman, Tymbraeus Apollo. Marius and\nhis Marie, or his Marion, or his Maria, or his Mariette. They must make\na queer pair of lovers. I know just what it is like. Ecstasies in which\nthey forget to kiss. Pure on earth, but joined in heaven. They are souls\npossessed of senses. They lie among the stars.\"\n\nGrantaire was attacking his second bottle and, possibly, his second\nharangue, when a new personage emerged from the square aperture of the\nstairs. It was a boy less than ten years of age, ragged, very small,\nyellow, with an odd phiz, a vivacious eye, an enormous amount of hair\ndrenched with rain, and wearing a contented air.\n\nThe child unhesitatingly making his choice among the three, addressed\nhimself to Laigle de Meaux.\n\n\"Are you Monsieur Bossuet?\"\n\n\"That is my nickname,\" replied Laigle. \"What do you want with me?\"\n\n\"This. A tall blonde fellow on the boulevard said to me: 'Do you know\nMother Hucheloup?' I said: 'Yes, Rue Chanvrerie, the old man's widow;'\nhe said to me: 'Go there. There you will find M. Bossuet. Tell him from\nme: \"A B C\".' It's a joke that they're playing on you, isn't it. He gave\nme ten sous.\"\n\n\"Joly, lend me ten sous,\" said Laigle; and, turning to Grantaire:\n\"Grantaire, lend me ten sous.\"\n\nThis made twenty sous, which Laigle handed to the lad.\n\n\"Thank you, sir,\" said the urchin.\n\n\"What is your name?\" inquired Laigle.\n\n\"Navet, Gavroche's friend.\"\n\n\"Stay with us,\" said Laigle.\n\n\"Breakfast with us,\" said Grantaire.\n\nThe child replied:--\n\n\"I can't, I belong in the procession, I'm the one to shout 'Down with\nPolignac!'\"\n\nAnd executing a prolonged scrape of his foot behind him, which is the\nmost respectful of all possible salutes, he took his departure.\n\nThe child gone, Grantaire took the word:--\n\n\"That is the pure-bred gamin. There are a great many varieties of the\ngamin species. The notary's gamin is called Skip-the-Gutter, the cook's\ngamin is called a scullion, the baker's gamin is called a mitron,\nthe lackey's gamin is called a groom, the marine gamin is called the\ncabin-boy, the soldier's gamin is called the drummer-boy, the painter's\ngamin is called paint-grinder, the tradesman's gamin is called an\nerrand-boy, the courtesan gamin is called the minion, the kingly gamin\nis called the dauphin, the god gamin is called the bambino.\"\n\nIn the meantime, Laigle was engaged in reflection; he said half aloud:--\n\n\"A B C, that is to say: the burial of Lamarque.\"\n\n\"The tall blonde,\" remarked Grantaire, \"is Enjolras, who is sending you\na warning.\"\n\n\"Shall we go?\" ejaculated Bossuet.\n\n\"It's raiding,\" said Joly. \"I have sworn to go through fire, but not\nthrough water. I don't wand to ged a gold.\"\n\n\"I shall stay here,\" said Grantaire. \"I prefer a breakfast to a hearse.\"\n\n\"Conclusion: we remain,\" said Laigle. \"Well, then, let us drink.\nBesides, we might miss the funeral without missing the riot.\"\n\n\"Ah! the riot, I am with you!\" cried Joly.\n\nLaigle rubbed his hands.\n\n\"Now we're going to touch up the revolution of 1830. As a matter of\nfact, it does hurt the people along the seams.\"\n\n\"I don't think much of your revolution,\" said Grantaire. \"I don't\nexecrate this Government. It is the crown tempered by the cotton\nnight-cap. It is a sceptre ending in an umbrella. In fact, I think\nthat to-day, with the present weather, Louis Philippe might utilize his\nroyalty in two directions, he might extend the tip of the sceptre end\nagainst the people, and open the umbrella end against heaven.\"\n\nThe room was dark, large clouds had just finished the extinction of\ndaylight. There was no one in the wine-shop, or in the street, every one\nhaving gone off \"to watch events.\"\n\n\"Is it mid-day or midnight?\" cried Bossuet. \"You can't see your hand\nbefore your face. Gibelotte, fetch a light.\"\n\nGrantaire was drinking in a melancholy way.\n\n\"Enjolras disdains me,\" he muttered. \"Enjolras said: 'Joly is ill,\nGrantaire is drunk.' It was to Bossuet that he sent Navet. If he had\ncome for me, I would have followed him. So much the worse for Enjolras!\nI won't go to his funeral.\"\n\nThis resolution once arrived at, Bossuet, Joly, and Grantaire did not\nstir from the wine-shop. By two o'clock in the afternoon, the table at\nwhich they sat was covered with empty bottles. Two candles were burning\non it, one in a flat copper candlestick which was perfectly green, the\nother in the neck of a cracked carafe. Grantaire had seduced Joly and\nBossuet to wine; Bossuet and Joly had conducted Grantaire back towards\ncheerfulness.\n\nAs for Grantaire, he had got beyond wine, that merely moderate\ninspirer of dreams, ever since mid-day. Wine enjoys only a conventional\npopularity with serious drinkers. There is, in fact, in the matter\nof inebriety, white magic and black magic; wine is only white magic.\nGrantaire was a daring drinker of dreams. The blackness of a terrible\nfit of drunkenness yawning before him, far from arresting him, attracted\nhim. He had abandoned the bottle and taken to the beerglass. The\nbeer-glass is the abyss. Having neither opium nor hashish on hand, and\nbeing desirous of filling his brain with twilight, he had had recourse\nto that fearful mixture of brandy, stout, absinthe, which produces the\nmost terrible of lethargies. It is of these three vapors, beer, brandy,\nand absinthe, that the lead of the soul is composed. They are three\ngrooms; the celestial butterfly is drowned in them; and there are formed\nthere in a membranous smoke, vaguely condensed into the wing of the bat,\nthree mute furies, Nightmare, Night, and Death, which hover about the\nslumbering Psyche.\n\nGrantaire had not yet reached that lamentable phase; far from it. He was\ntremendously gay, and Bossuet and Joly retorted. They clinked glasses.\nGrantaire added to the eccentric accentuation of words and ideas,\na peculiarity of gesture; he rested his left fist on his knee with\ndignity, his arm forming a right angle, and, with cravat untied, seated\nastride a stool, his full glass in his right hand, he hurled solemn\nwords at the big maid-servant Matelote:--\n\n\"Let the doors of the palace be thrown open! Let every one be a member\nof the French Academy and have the right to embrace Madame Hucheloup.\nLet us drink.\"\n\nAnd turning to Madame Hucheloup, he added:--\n\n\"Woman ancient and consecrated by use, draw near that I may contemplate\nthee!\"\n\nAnd Joly exclaimed:--\n\n\"Matelote and Gibelotte, dod't gib Grantaire anything more to drink.\nHe has already devoured, since this bording, in wild prodigality, two\nfrancs and ninety-five centibes.\"\n\nAnd Grantaire began again:--\n\n\"Who has been unhooking the stars without my permission, and putting\nthem on the table in the guise of candles?\"\n\nBossuet, though very drunk, preserved his equanimity.\n\nHe was seated on the sill of the open window, wetting his back in the\nfalling rain, and gazing at his two friends.\n\nAll at once, he heard a tumult behind him, hurried footsteps, cries of\n\"To arms!\" He turned round and saw in the Rue Saint-Denis, at the end\nof the Rue de la Chanvrerie, Enjolras passing, gun in hand, and Gavroche\nwith his pistol, Feuilly with his sword, Courfeyrac with his sword, and\nJean Prouvaire with his blunderbuss, Combeferre with his gun, Bahorel\nwith his gun, and the whole armed and stormy rabble which was following\nthem.\n\nThe Rue de la Chanvrerie was not more than a gunshot long. Bossuet\nimprovised a speaking-trumpet from his two hands placed around his\nmouth, and shouted:--\n\n\"Courfeyrac! Courfeyrac! Hohee!\"\n\nCourfeyrac heard the shout, caught sight of Bossuet, and advanced a few\npaces into the Rue de la Chanvrerie, shouting: \"What do you want?\" which\ncrossed a \"Where are you going?\"\n\n\"To make a barricade,\" replied Courfeyrac.\n\n\"Well, here! This is a good place! Make it here!\"\n\n\"That's true, Aigle,\" said Courfeyrac.\n\nAnd at a signal from Courfeyrac, the mob flung themselves into the Rue\nde la Chanvrerie.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III--NIGHT BEGINS TO DESCEND UPON GRANTAIRE\n\nThe spot was, in fact, admirably adapted, the entrance to the street\nwidened out, the other extremity narrowed together into a pocket\nwithout exit. Corinthe created an obstacle, the Rue Mondetour was easily\nbarricaded on the right and the left, no attack was possible except\nfrom the Rue Saint-Denis, that is to say, in front, and in full sight.\nBossuet had the comprehensive glance of a fasting Hannibal.\n\nTerror had seized on the whole street at the irruption of the mob. There\nwas not a passer-by who did not get out of sight. In the space of a\nflash of lightning, in the rear, to right and left, shops, stables,\narea-doors, windows, blinds, attic skylights, shutters of every\ndescription were closed, from the ground floor to the roof. A terrified\nold woman fixed a mattress in front of her window on two clothes-poles\nfor drying linen, in order to deaden the effect of musketry. The\nwine-shop alone remained open; and that for a very good reason, that the\nmob had rushed into it.--\"Ah my God! Ah my God!\" sighed Mame Hucheloup.\n\nBossuet had gone down to meet Courfeyrac.\n\nJoly, who had placed himself at the window, exclaimed:--\n\n\"Courfeyrac, you ought to have brought an umbrella. You will gatch\ngold.\"\n\nIn the meantime, in the space of a few minutes, twenty iron bars had\nbeen wrenched from the grated front of the wine-shop, ten fathoms of\nstreet had been unpaved; Gavroche and Bahorel had seized in its passage,\nand overturned, the dray of a lime-dealer named Anceau; this dray\ncontained three barrels of lime, which they placed beneath the piles\nof paving-stones: Enjolras raised the cellar trap, and all the widow\nHucheloup's empty casks were used to flank the barrels of lime; Feuilly,\nwith his fingers skilled in painting the delicate sticks of fans, had\nbacked up the barrels and the dray with two massive heaps of blocks of\nrough stone. Blocks which were improvised like the rest and procured\nno one knows where. The beams which served as props were torn from\nthe neighboring house-fronts and laid on the casks. When Bossuet and\nCourfeyrac turned round, half the street was already barred with\na rampart higher than a man. There is nothing like the hand of the\npopulace for building everything that is built by demolishing.\n\nMatelote and Gibelotte had mingled with the workers. Gibelotte went and\ncame loaded with rubbish. Her lassitude helped on the barricade. She\nserved the barricade as she would have served wine, with a sleepy air.\n\nAn omnibus with two white horses passed the end of the street.\n\nBossuet strode over the paving-stones, ran to it, stopped the driver,\nmade the passengers alight, offered his hand to \"the ladies,\" dismissed\nthe conductor, and returned, leading the vehicle and the horses by the\nbridle.\n\n\"Omnibuses,\" said he, \"do not pass the Corinthe. Non licet omnibus adire\nCorinthum.\"\n\nAn instant later, the horses were unharnessed and went off at their\nwill, through the Rue Mondetour, and the omnibus lying on its side\ncompleted the bar across the street.\n\nMame Hucheloup, quite upset, had taken refuge in the first story.\n\nHer eyes were vague, and stared without seeing anything, and she cried\nin a low tone. Her terrified shrieks did not dare to emerge from her\nthroat.\n\n\"The end of the world has come,\" she muttered.\n\nJoly deposited a kiss on Mame Hucheloup's fat, red, wrinkled neck, and\nsaid to Grantaire: \"My dear fellow, I have always regarded a woman's\nneck as an infinitely delicate thing.\"\n\nBut Grantaire attained to the highest regions of dithryamb. Matelote\nhad mounted to the first floor once more, Grantaire seized her round her\nwaist, and gave vent to long bursts of laughter at the window.\n\n\"Matelote is homely!\" he cried: \"Matelote is of a dream of ugliness!\nMatelote is a chimaera. This is the secret of her birth: a Gothic\nPygmalion, who was making gargoyles for cathedrals, fell in love with\none of them, the most horrible, one fine morning. He besought Love to\ngive it life, and this produced Matelote. Look at her, citizens! She has\nchromate-of-lead-colored hair, like Titian's mistress, and she is a good\ngirl. I guarantee that she will fight well. Every good girl contains\na hero. As for Mother Hucheloup, she's an old warrior. Look at her\nmoustaches! She inherited them from her husband. A hussar indeed! She\nwill fight too. These two alone will strike terror to the heart of the\nbanlieue. Comrades, we shall overthrow the government as true as there\nare fifteen intermediary acids between margaric acid and formic acid;\nhowever, that is a matter of perfect indifference to me. Gentlemen, my\nfather always detested me because I could not understand mathematics.\nI understand only love and liberty. I am Grantaire, the good fellow.\nHaving never had any money, I never acquired the habit of it, and the\nresult is that I have never lacked it; but, if I had been rich, there\nwould have been no more poor people! You would have seen! Oh, if the\nkind hearts only had fat purses, how much better things would go! I\npicture myself Jesus Christ with Rothschild's fortune! How much good he\nwould do! Matelote, embrace me! You are voluptuous and timid! You have\ncheeks which invite the kiss of a sister, and lips which claim the kiss\nof a lover.\"\n\n\"Hold your tongue, you cask!\" said Courfeyrac.\n\nGrantaire retorted:--\n\n\"I am the capitoul[52] and the master of the floral games!\"\n\nEnjolras, who was standing on the crest of the barricade, gun in hand,\nraised his beautiful, austere face. Enjolras, as the reader knows, had\nsomething of the Spartan and of the Puritan in his composition. He would\nhave perished at Thermopylae with Leonidas, and burned at Drogheda with\nCromwell.\n\n\"Grantaire,\" he shouted, \"go get rid of the fumes of your wine somewhere\nelse than here. This is the place for enthusiasm, not for drunkenness.\nDon't disgrace the barricade!\"\n\nThis angry speech produced a singular effect on Grantaire. One would\nhave said that he had had a glass of cold water flung in his face. He\nseemed to be rendered suddenly sober.\n\nHe sat down, put his elbows on a table near the window, looked at\nEnjolras with indescribable gentleness, and said to him:--\n\n\"Let me sleep here.\"\n\n\"Go and sleep somewhere else,\" cried Enjolras.\n\nBut Grantaire, still keeping his tender and troubled eyes fixed on him,\nreplied:--\n\n\"Let me sleep here,--until I die.\"\n\nEnjolras regarded him with disdainful eyes:--\n\n\"Grantaire, you are incapable of believing, of thinking, of willing, of\nliving, and of dying.\"\n\nGrantaire replied in a grave tone:--\n\n\"You will see.\"\n\nHe stammered a few more unintelligible words, then his head fell heavily\non the table, and, as is the usual effect of the second period of\ninebriety, into which Enjolras had roughly and abruptly thrust him, an\ninstant later he had fallen asleep.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV--AN ATTEMPT TO CONSOLE THE WIDOW HUCHELOUP\n\nBahorel, in ecstasies over the barricade, shouted:--\n\n\"Here's the street in its low-necked dress! How well it looks!\"\n\nCourfeyrac, as he demolished the wine-shop to some extent, sought to\nconsole the widowed proprietress.\n\n\"Mother Hucheloup, weren't you complaining the other day because you\nhad had a notice served on you for infringing the law, because Gibelotte\nshook a counterpane out of your window?\"\n\n\"Yes, my good Monsieur Courfeyrac. Ah! good Heavens, are you going\nto put that table of mine in your horror, too? And it was for the\ncounterpane, and also for a pot of flowers which fell from the attic\nwindow into the street, that the government collected a fine of a\nhundred francs. If that isn't an abomination, what is!\"\n\n\"Well, Mother Hucheloup, we are avenging you.\"\n\nMother Hucheloup did not appear to understand very clearly the benefit\nwhich she was to derive from these reprisals made on her account. She\nwas satisfied after the manner of that Arab woman, who, having received\na box on the ear from her husband, went to complain to her father, and\ncried for vengeance, saying: \"Father, you owe my husband affront for\naffront.\" The father asked: \"On which cheek did you receive the blow?\"\n\"On the left cheek.\" The father slapped her right cheek and said: \"Now\nyou are satisfied. Go tell your husband that he boxed my daughter's\nears, and that I have accordingly boxed his wife's.\"\n\nThe rain had ceased. Recruits had arrived. Workmen had brought under\ntheir blouses a barrel of powder, a basket containing bottles of\nvitriol, two or three carnival torches, and a basket filled with\nfire-pots, \"left over from the King's festival.\" This festival was very\nrecent, having taken place on the 1st of May. It was said that these\nmunitions came from a grocer in the Faubourg Saint-Antoine named Pepin.\nThey smashed the only street lantern in the Rue de la Chanvrerie,\nthe lantern corresponding to one in the Rue Saint-Denis, and all\nthe lanterns in the surrounding streets, de Mondetour, du Cygne, des\nPrecheurs, and de la Grande and de la Petite-Truanderie.\n\nEnjolras, Combeferre, and Courfeyrac directed everything. Two barricades\nwere now in process of construction at once, both of them resting on the\nCorinthe house and forming a right angle; the larger shut off the Rue\nde la Chanvrerie, the other closed the Rue Mondetour, on the side of\nthe Rue de Cygne. This last barricade, which was very narrow, was\nconstructed only of casks and paving-stones. There were about fifty\nworkers on it; thirty were armed with guns; for, on their way, they had\neffected a wholesale loan from an armorer's shop.\n\nNothing could be more bizarre and at the same time more motley than this\ntroop. One had a round-jacket, a cavalry sabre, and two holster-pistols,\nanother was in his shirt-sleeves, with a round hat, and a powder-horn\nslung at his side, a third wore a plastron of nine sheets of gray paper\nand was armed with a saddler's awl. There was one who was shouting:\n\"Let us exterminate them to the last man and die at the point of our\nbayonet.\" This man had no bayonet. Another spread out over his coat the\ncross-belt and cartridge-box of a National Guardsman, the cover of the\ncartridge-box being ornamented with this inscription in red worsted:\nPublic Order. There were a great many guns bearing the numbers of the\nlegions, few hats, no cravats, many bare arms, some pikes. Add to\nthis, all ages, all sorts of faces, small, pale young men, and bronzed\nlongshoremen. All were in haste; and as they helped each other, they\ndiscussed the possible chances. That they would receive succor about\nthree o'clock in the morning--that they were sure of one regiment, that\nParis would rise. Terrible sayings with which was mingled a sort of\ncordial joviality. One would have pronounced them brothers, but they did\nnot know each other's names. Great perils have this fine characteristic,\nthat they bring to light the fraternity of strangers. A fire had been\nlighted in the kitchen, and there they were engaged in moulding into\nbullets, pewter mugs, spoons, forks, and all the brass table-ware of\nthe establishment. In the midst of it all, they drank. Caps and\nbuckshot were mixed pell-mell on the tables with glasses of wine. In\nthe billiard-hall, Mame Hucheloup, Matelote, and Gibelotte, variously\nmodified by terror, which had stupefied one, rendered another\nbreathless, and roused the third, were tearing up old dish-cloths and\nmaking lint; three insurgents were assisting them, three bushy-haired,\njolly blades with beards and moustaches, who plucked away at the linen\nwith the fingers of seamstresses and who made them tremble.\n\nThe man of lofty stature whom Courfeyrac, Combeferre, and Enjolras had\nobserved at the moment when he joined the mob at the corner of the\nRue des Billettes, was at work on the smaller barricade and was making\nhimself useful there. Gavroche was working on the larger one. As for the\nyoung man who had been waiting for Courfeyrac at his lodgings, and who\nhad inquired for M. Marius, he had disappeared at about the time when\nthe omnibus had been overturned.\n\nGavroche, completely carried away and radiant, had undertaken to get\neverything in readiness. He went, came, mounted, descended, re-mounted,\nwhistled, and sparkled. He seemed to be there for the encouragement of\nall. Had he any incentive? Yes, certainly, his poverty; had he wings?\nyes, certainly, his joy. Gavroche was a whirlwind. He was constantly\nvisible, he was incessantly audible. He filled the air, as he was\neverywhere at once. He was a sort of almost irritating ubiquity; no halt\nwas possible with him. The enormous barricade felt him on its haunches.\nHe troubled the loungers, he excited the idle, he reanimated the weary,\nhe grew impatient over the thoughtful, he inspired gayety in some,\nand breath in others, wrath in others, movement in all, now pricking\na student, now biting an artisan; he alighted, paused, flew off again,\nhovered over the tumult, and the effort, sprang from one party to\nanother, murmuring and humming, and harassed the whole company; a fly on\nthe immense revolutionary coach.\n\nPerpetual motion was in his little arms and perpetual clamor in his\nlittle lungs.\n\n\"Courage! more paving-stones! more casks! more machines! Where are you\nnow? A hod of plaster for me to stop this hole with! Your barricade\nis very small. It must be carried up. Put everything on it, fling\neverything there, stick it all in. Break down the house. A barricade is\nMother Gibou's tea. Hullo, here's a glass door.\"\n\nThis elicited an exclamation from the workers.\n\n\"A glass door? what do you expect us to do with a glass door, tubercle?\"\n\n\"Hercules yourselves!\" retorted Gavroche. \"A glass door is an excellent\nthing in a barricade. It does not prevent an attack, but it prevents the\nenemy taking it. So you've never prigged apples over a wall where there\nwere broken bottles? A glass door cuts the corns of the National Guard\nwhen they try to mount on the barricade. Pardi! glass is a treacherous\nthing. Well, you haven't a very wildly lively imagination, comrades.\"\n\nHowever, he was furious over his triggerless pistol. He went from one to\nanother, demanding: \"A gun, I want a gun! Why don't you give me a gun?\"\n\n\"Give you a gun!\" said Combeferre.\n\n\"Come now!\" said Gavroche, \"why not? I had one in 1830 when we had a\ndispute with Charles X.\"\n\nEnjolras shrugged his shoulders.\n\n\"When there are enough for the men, we will give some to the children.\"\n\nGavroche wheeled round haughtily, and answered:--\n\n\"If you are killed before me, I shall take yours.\"\n\n\"Gamin!\" said Enjolras.\n\n\"Greenhorn!\" said Gavroche.\n\nA dandy who had lost his way and who lounged past the end of the street\ncreated a diversion! Gavroche shouted to him:--\n\n\"Come with us, young fellow! well now, don't we do anything for this old\ncountry of ours?\"\n\nThe dandy fled.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V--PREPARATIONS\n\nThe journals of the day which said that that nearly impregnable\nstructure, of the barricade of the Rue de la Chanvrerie, as they call\nit, reached to the level of the first floor, were mistaken. The fact is,\nthat it did not exceed an average height of six or seven feet. It was\nbuilt in such a manner that the combatants could, at their will, either\ndisappear behind it or dominate the barrier and even scale its crest by\nmeans of a quadruple row of paving-stones placed on top of each other\nand arranged as steps in the interior. On the outside, the front of the\nbarricade, composed of piles of paving-stones and casks bound together\nby beams and planks, which were entangled in the wheels of Anceau's dray\nand of the overturned omnibus, had a bristling and inextricable aspect.\n\nAn aperture large enough to allow a man to pass through had been made\nbetween the wall of the houses and the extremity of the barricade which\nwas furthest from the wine-shop, so that an exit was possible at this\npoint. The pole of the omnibus was placed upright and held up with\nropes, and a red flag, fastened to this pole, floated over the\nbarricade.\n\nThe little Mondetour barricade, hidden behind the wine-shop building,\nwas not visible. The two barricades united formed a veritable redoubt.\nEnjolras and Courfeyrac had not thought fit to barricade the other\nfragment of the Rue Mondetour which opens through the Rue des Precheurs\nan issue into the Halles, wishing, no doubt, to preserve a possible\ncommunication with the outside, and not entertaining much fear of\nan attack through the dangerous and difficult street of the Rue des\nPrecheurs.\n\nWith the exception of this issue which was left free, and which\nconstituted what Folard in his strategical style would have termed a\nbranch and taking into account, also, the narrow cutting arranged on the\nRue de la Chanvrerie, the interior of the barricade, where the wine-shop\nformed a salient angle, presented an irregular square, closed on all\nsides. There existed an interval of twenty paces between the grand\nbarrier and the lofty houses which formed the background of the street,\nso that one might say that the barricade rested on these houses, all\ninhabited, but closed from top to bottom.\n\nAll this work was performed without any hindrance, in less than an hour,\nand without this handful of bold men seeing a single bear-skin cap or\na single bayonet make their appearance. The very bourgeois who still\nventured at this hour of riot to enter the Rue Saint-Denis cast a\nglance at the Rue de la Chanvrerie, caught sight of the barricade, and\nredoubled their pace.\n\nThe two barricades being finished, and the flag run up, a table was\ndragged out of the wine-shop; and Courfeyrac mounted on the table.\nEnjolras brought the square coffer, and Courfeyrac opened it. This\ncoffer was filled with cartridges. When the mob saw the cartridges, a\ntremor ran through the bravest, and a momentary silence ensued.\n\nCourfeyrac distributed them with a smile.\n\nEach one received thirty cartridges. Many had powder, and set about\nmaking others with the bullets which they had run. As for the barrel of\npowder, it stood on a table on one side, near the door, and was held in\nreserve.\n\nThe alarm beat which ran through all Paris, did not cease, but it had\nfinally come to be nothing more than a monotonous noise to which they no\nlonger paid any attention. This noise retreated at times, and again drew\nnear, with melancholy undulations.\n\nThey loaded the guns and carbines, all together, without haste, with\nsolemn gravity. Enjolras went and stationed three sentinels outside the\nbarricades, one in the Rue de la Chanvrerie, the second in the Rue des\nPrecheurs, the third at the corner of the Rue de la Petite Truanderie.\n\nThen, the barricades having been built, the posts assigned, the guns\nloaded, the sentinels stationed, they waited, alone in those redoubtable\nstreets through which no one passed any longer, surrounded by those\ndumb houses which seemed dead and in which no human movement palpitated,\nenveloped in the deepening shades of twilight which was drawing on,\nin the midst of that silence through which something could be felt\nadvancing, and which had about it something tragic and terrifying,\nisolated, armed, determined, and tranquil.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI--WAITING\n\nDuring those hours of waiting, what did they do?\n\nWe must needs tell, since this is a matter of history.\n\nWhile the men made bullets and the women lint, while a large saucepan\nof melted brass and lead, destined to the bullet-mould smoked over a\nglowing brazier, while the sentinels watched, weapon in hand, on the\nbarricade, while Enjolras, whom it was impossible to divert, kept an\neye on the sentinels, Combeferre, Courfeyrac, Jean Prouvaire, Feuilly,\nBossuet, Joly, Bahorel, and some others, sought each other out and\nunited as in the most peaceful days of their conversations in their\nstudent life, and, in one corner of this wine-shop which had been\nconverted into a casement, a couple of paces distant from the redoubt\nwhich they had built, with their carbines loaded and primed resting\nagainst the backs of their chairs, these fine young fellows, so close to\na supreme hour, began to recite love verses.\n\nWhat verses? These:--\n\n               Vous rappelez-vous notre douce vie,\n                 Lorsque nous etions si jeunes tous deux,\n               Et que nous n'avions au coeur d'autre envie\n                 Que d'etre bien mis et d'etre amoureux,\n\n               Lorsqu'en ajoutant votre age a mon age,\n                 Nous ne comptions pas a deux quarante ans,\n               Et que, dans notre humble et petit menage,\n                 Tout, meme l'hiver, nous etait printemps?\n\n               Beaux jours! Manuel etait fier et sage,\n                 Paris s'asseyait a de saints banquets,\n               Foy lancait la foudre, et votre corsage\n                 Avait une epingle ou je me piquais.\n\n               Tout vous contemplait.

Quels cheveux a flots!\n               Sous son mantelet elle cache une aile,\n                 Son bonnet charmant est a peine eclos.\n\n               J'errais avec toi, pressant ton bras souple.\n                 Les passants crovaient que l'amour charme\n               Avait marie, dans notre heureux couple,\n                 Le doux mois d'avril au beau mois de mai.\n\n               Nous vivions caches, contents, porte close,\n                 Devorant l'amour, bon fruit defendu,\n               Ma bouche n'avait pas dit une chose\n                 Que deja ton coeur avait repondu.\n\n               La Sorbonne etait l'endroit bucolique\n                 Ou je t'adorais du soir au matin.\n               C'est ainsi qu'une ame amoureuse applique\n                 La carte du Tendre au pays Latin.\n\n               O place Maubert! o place Dauphine!\n                 Quand, dans le taudis frais et printanier,\n               Tu tirais ton bas sur ton jambe fine,\n                 Je voyais un astre au fond du grenier.\n\n               J'ai fort lu Platon, mais rien ne m'en reste;\n                 Mieux que Malebranche et que Lamennais,\n               Tu me demontrais la bonte celeste\n                 Avec une fleur que tu me donnais.\n\n               Je t'obeissais, tu m' etais soumise;\n                 O grenier dore! te lacer! te voir\n               Aller et venir des l'aube en chemise,\n                 Mirant ton jeune front a ton vieux miroir.\n\n               Et qui done pourrait perde la memoire\n                 De ces temps d'aurore et de firmament,\n               De rubans, de fleurs, de gaze et de moire,\n                 Ou l'amour begaye un argot charmant?\n\n               Nos jardins etaient un pot de tulipe;\n                 Tu masquais la vitre avec un jupon;\n               Je prenais le bol de terre de pipe,\n                 Et je te donnais le tasse en japon.\n\n               Et ces grands malheurs qui nous faisaient rire!\n                 Ton manchon brule, ton boa perdu!\n               Et ce cher portrait du divin Shakespeare\n                 Qu'un soir pour souper nons avons vendu!\n\n               J'etais mendiant et toi charitable.\n                 Je baisais au vol tes bras frais et ronds.\n               Dante in folio nous servait de table\n                 Pour manger gaiment un cent de marrons.\n\n               La premiere fois qu'en mon joyeux bouge\n                 Je pris un baiser a ton levre en feu,\n               Quand tu t'en allais decoiffee et rouge,\n                 Je restai tout pale et je crus en Dieu!\n\n               Te rappelles-tu nos bonheurs sans nombre,\n                 Et tous ces fichus changes en chiffons?\n               Oh que de soupirs, de nos coeurs pleins d'ombre,\n                 Se sont envoles dans les cieux profonds![53]\n\n\nThe hour, the spot, these souvenirs of youth recalled, a few stars\nwhich began to twinkle in the sky, the funeral repose of those deserted\nstreets, the imminence of the inexorable adventure, which was in\npreparation, gave a pathetic charm to these verses murmured in a low\ntone in the dusk by Jean Prouvaire, who, as we have said, was a gentle\npoet.\n\nIn the meantime, a lamp had been lighted in the small barricade, and in\nthe large one, one of those wax torches such as are to be met with on\nShrove-Tuesday in front of vehicles loaded with masks, on their way\nto la Courtille. These torches, as the reader has seen, came from the\nFaubourg Saint-Antoine.\n\nThe torch had been placed in a sort of cage of paving-stones closed on\nthree sides to shelter it from the wind, and disposed in such a fashion\nthat all the light fell on the flag. The street and the barricade\nremained sunk in gloom, and nothing was to be seen except the red flag\nformidably illuminated as by an enormous dark-lantern.\n\nThis light enhanced the scarlet of the flag, with an indescribable and\nterrible purple.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII--THE MAN RECRUITED IN THE RUE DES BILLETTES\n\nNight was fully come, nothing made its appearance. All that they heard\nwas confused noises, and at intervals, fusillades; but these were rare,\nbadly sustained and distant. This respite, which was thus prolonged,\nwas a sign that the Government was taking its time, and collecting its\nforces. These fifty men were waiting for sixty thousand.\n\nEnjolras felt attacked by that impatience which seizes on strong souls\non the threshold of redoubtable events. He went in search of Gavroche,\nwho had set to making cartridges in the tap-room, by the dubious light\nof two candles placed on the counter by way of precaution, on account of\nthe powder which was scattered on the tables. These two candles cast no\ngleam outside. The insurgents had, moreover, taken pains not to have any\nlight in the upper stories.\n\nGavroche was deeply preoccupied at that moment, but not precisely with\nhis cartridges. The man of the Rue des Billettes had just entered\nthe tap-room and had seated himself at the table which was the least\nlighted. A musket of large model had fallen to his share, and he held it\nbetween his legs. Gavroche, who had been, up to that moment, distracted\nby a hundred \"amusing\" things, had not even seen this man.\n\nWhen he entered, Gavroche followed him mechanically with his eyes,\nadmiring his gun; then, all at once, when the man was seated, the street\nurchin sprang to his feet. Any one who had spied upon that man up to\nthat moment, would have seen that he was observing everything in the\nbarricade and in the band of insurgents, with singular attention; but,\nfrom the moment when he had entered this room, he had fallen into a sort\nof brown study, and no longer seemed to see anything that was going on.\nThe gamin approached this pensive personage, and began to step around\nhim on tiptoe, as one walks in the vicinity of a person whom one is\nafraid of waking. At the same time, over his childish countenance which\nwas, at once so impudent and so serious, so giddy and so profound, so\ngay and so heart-breaking, passed all those grimaces of an old man which\nsignify: Ah bah! impossible! My sight is bad! I am dreaming! can this\nbe? no, it is not! but yes! why, no! etc. Gavroche balanced on his\nheels, clenched both fists in his pockets, moved his neck around like a\nbird, expended in a gigantic pout all the sagacity of his lower lip. He\nwas astounded, uncertain, incredulous, convinced, dazzled. He had the\nmien of the chief of the eunuchs in the slave mart, discovering a\nVenus among the blowsy females, and the air of an amateur recognizing\na Raphael in a heap of daubs. His whole being was at work, the instinct\nwhich scents out, and the intelligence which combines. It was evident\nthat a great event had happened in Gavroche's life.\n\nIt was at the most intense point of this preoccupation that Enjolras\naccosted him.\n\n\"You are small,\" said Enjolras, \"you will not be seen. Go out of the\nbarricade, slip along close to the houses, skirmish about a bit in the\nstreets, and come back and tell me what is going on.\"\n\nGavroche raised himself on his haunches.\n\n\"So the little chaps are good for something! that's very lucky! I'll\ngo! In the meanwhile, trust to the little fellows, and distrust the big\nones.\" And Gavroche, raising his head and lowering his voice, added,\nas he indicated the man of the Rue des Billettes: \"Do you see that big\nfellow there?\"\n\n\"Well?\"\n\n\"He's a police spy.\"\n\n\"Are you sure of it?\"\n\n\"It isn't two weeks since he pulled me off the cornice of the Port\nRoyal, where I was taking the air, by my ear.\"\n\nEnjolras hastily quitted the urchin and murmured a few words in a very\nlow tone to a longshoreman from the winedocks who chanced to be at hand.\nThe man left the room, and returned almost immediately, accompanied by\nthree others. The four men, four porters with broad shoulders, went\nand placed themselves without doing anything to attract his attention,\nbehind the table on which the man of the Rue des Billettes was leaning\nwith his elbows. They were evidently ready to hurl themselves upon him.\n\nThen Enjolras approached the man and demanded of him:--\n\n\"Who are you?\"\n\nAt this abrupt query, the man started. He plunged his gaze deep into\nEnjolras' clear eyes and appeared to grasp the latter's meaning. He\nsmiled with a smile than which nothing more disdainful, more energetic,\nand more resolute could be seen in the world, and replied with haughty\ngravity:--\n\n\"I see what it is. Well, yes!\"\n\n\"You are a police spy?\"\n\n\"I am an agent of the authorities.\"\n\n\"And your name?\"\n\n\"Javert.\"\n\nEnjolras made a sign to the four men. In the twinkling of an eye, before\nJavert had time to turn round, he was collared, thrown down, pinioned\nand searched.\n\nThey found on him a little round card pasted between two pieces of\nglass, and bearing on one side the arms of France, engraved, and with\nthis motto: Supervision and vigilance, and on the other this note:\n\"JAVERT, inspector of police, aged fifty-two,\" and the signature of the\nPrefect of Police of that day, M. Gisquet.\n\nBesides this, he had his watch and his purse, which contained several\ngold pieces. They left him his purse and his watch. Under the watch,\nat the bottom of his fob, they felt and seized a paper in an envelope,\nwhich Enjolras unfolded, and on which he read these five lines, written\nin the very hand of the Prefect of Police:--\n\n\"As soon as his political mission is accomplished, Inspector Javert\nwill make sure, by special supervision, whether it is true that the\nmalefactors have instituted intrigues on the right bank of the Seine,\nnear the Jena bridge.\"\n\nThe search ended, they lifted Javert to his feet, bound his arms behind\nhis back, and fastened him to that celebrated post in the middle of the\nroom which had formerly given the wine-shop its name.\n\nGavroche, who had looked on at the whole of this scene and had approved\nof everything with a silent toss of his head, stepped up to Javert and\nsaid to him:--\n\n\"It's the mouse who has caught the cat.\"\n\nAll this was so rapidly executed, that it was all over when those about\nthe wine-shop noticed it.\n\nJavert had not uttered a single cry.\n\nAt the sight of Javert bound to the post, Courfeyrac, Bossuet, Joly,\nCombeferre, and the men scattered over the two barricades came running\nup.\n\nJavert, with his back to the post, and so surrounded with ropes that he\ncould not make a movement, raised his head with the intrepid serenity of\nthe man who has never lied.\n\n\"He is a police spy,\" said Enjolras.\n\nAnd turning to Javert: \"You will be shot ten minutes before the\nbarricade is taken.\"\n\nJavert replied in his most imperious tone:--\n\n\"Why not at once?\"\n\n\"We are saving our powder.\"\n\n\"Then finish the business with a blow from a knife.\"\n\n\"Spy,\" said the handsome Enjolras, \"we are judges and not assassins.\"\n\nThen he called Gavroche:--\n\n\"Here you! go about your business! Do what I told you!\"\n\n\"I'm going!\" cried Gavroche.\n\nAnd halting as he was on the point of setting out:--\n\n\"By the way, you will give me his gun!\" and he added: \"I leave you the\nmusician, but I want the clarionet.\"\n\nThe gamin made the military salute and passed gayly through the opening\nin the large barricade.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII--MANY INTERROGATION POINTS WITH REGARD TO A CERTAIN LE\nCABUC WHOSE NAME MAY NOT HAVE BEEN LE CABUC\n\nThe tragic picture which we have undertaken would not be complete, the\nreader would not see those grand moments of social birth-pangs in a\nrevolutionary birth, which contain convulsion mingled with effort,\nin their exact and real relief, were we to omit, in the sketch here\noutlined, an incident full of epic and savage horror which occurred\nalmost immediately after Gavroche's departure.\n\nMobs, as the reader knows, are like a snowball, and collect as they\nroll along, a throng of tumultuous men. These men do not ask each other\nwhence they come. Among the passers-by who had joined the rabble led by\nEnjolras, Combeferre, and Courfeyrac, there had been a person wearing\nthe jacket of a street porter, which was very threadbare on the\nshoulders, who gesticulated and vociferated, and who had the look of a\ndrunken savage. This man, whose name or nickname was Le Cabuc, and who\nwas, moreover, an utter stranger to those who pretended to know him,\nwas very drunk, or assumed the appearance of being so, and had seated\nhimself with several others at a table which they had dragged outside\nof the wine-shop. This Cabuc, while making those who vied with him drunk\nseemed to be examining with a thoughtful air the large house at the\nextremity of the barricade, whose five stories commanded the whole\nstreet and faced the Rue Saint-Denis. All at once he exclaimed:--\n\n\"Do you know, comrades, it is from that house yonder that we must fire.\nWhen we are at the windows, the deuce is in it if any one can advance\ninto the street!\"\n\n\"Yes, but the house is closed,\" said one of the drinkers.\n\n\"Let us knock!\"\n\n\"They will not open.\"\n\n\"Let us break in the door!\"\n\nLe Cabuc runs to the door, which had a very massive knocker, and knocks.\nThe door opens not. He strikes a second blow. No one answers. A third\nstroke. The same silence.\n\n\"Is there any one here?\" shouts Cabuc.\n\nNothing stirs.\n\nThen he seizes a gun and begins to batter the door with the butt end.\n\nIt was an ancient alley door, low, vaulted, narrow, solid, entirely of\noak, lined on the inside with a sheet of iron and iron stays, a genuine\nprison postern. The blows from the butt end of the gun made the house\ntremble, but did not shake the door.\n\nNevertheless, it is probable that the inhabitants were disturbed, for a\ntiny, square window was finally seen to open on the third story, and at\nthis aperture appeared the reverend and terrified face of a gray-haired\nold man, who was the porter, and who held a candle.\n\nThe man who was knocking paused.\n\n\"Gentlemen,\" said the porter, \"what do you want?\"\n\n\"Open!\" said Cabuc.\n\n\"That cannot be, gentlemen.\"\n\n\"Open, nevertheless.\"\n\n\"Impossible, gentlemen.\"\n\nLe Cabuc took his gun and aimed at the porter; but as he was below, and\nas it was very dark, the porter did not see him.\n\n\"Will you open, yes or no?\"\n\n\"No, gentlemen.\"\n\n\"Do you say no?\"\n\n\"I say no, my goo--\"\n\nThe porter did not finish. The shot was fired; the ball entered under\nhis chin and came out at the nape of his neck, after traversing the\njugular vein.\n\nThe old man fell back without a sigh. The candle fell and was\nextinguished, and nothing more was to be seen except a motionless head\nlying on the sill of the small window, and a little whitish smoke which\nfloated off towards the roof.\n\n\"There!\" said Le Cabuc, dropping the butt end of his gun to the\npavement.\n\nHe had hardly uttered this word, when he felt a hand laid on his\nshoulder with the weight of an eagle's talon, and he heard a voice\nsaying to him:--\n\n\"On your knees.\"\n\nThe murderer turned round and saw before him Enjolras' cold, white face.\n\nEnjolras held a pistol in his hand.\n\nHe had hastened up at the sound of the discharge.\n\nHe had seized Cabuc's collar, blouse, shirt, and suspender with his left\nhand.\n\n\"On your knees!\" he repeated.\n\nAnd, with an imperious motion, the frail young man of twenty years bent\nthe thickset and sturdy porter like a reed, and brought him to his knees\nin the mire.\n\nLe Cabuc attempted to resist, but he seemed to have been seized by a\nsuperhuman hand.\n\nEnjolras, pale, with bare neck and dishevelled hair, and his woman's\nface, had about him at that moment something of the antique Themis.\nHis dilated nostrils, his downcast eyes, gave to his implacable Greek\nprofile that expression of wrath and that expression of Chastity which,\nas the ancient world viewed the matter, befit Justice.\n\nThe whole barricade hastened up, then all ranged themselves in a circle\nat a distance, feeling that it was impossible to utter a word in the\npresence of the thing which they were about to behold.\n\nLe Cabuc, vanquished, no longer tried to struggle, and trembled in every\nlimb.\n\nEnjolras released him and drew out his watch.\n\n\"Collect yourself,\" said he. \"Think or pray. You have one minute.\"\n\n\"Mercy!\" murmured the murderer; then he dropped his head and stammered a\nfew inarticulate oaths.\n\nEnjolras never took his eyes off of him: he allowed a minute to pass,\nthen he replaced his watch in his fob. That done, he grasped Le Cabuc\nby the hair, as the latter coiled himself into a ball at his knees and\nshrieked, and placed the muzzle of the pistol to his ear. Many of those\nintrepid men, who had so tranquilly entered upon the most terrible of\nadventures, turned aside their heads.\n\nAn explosion was heard, the assassin fell to the pavement face\ndownwards.\n\nEnjolras straightened himself up, and cast a convinced and severe glance\naround him. Then he spurned the corpse with his foot and said:--\n\n\"Throw that outside.\"\n\nThree men raised the body of the unhappy wretch, which was still\nagitated by the last mechanical convulsions of the life that had fled,\nand flung it over the little barricade into the Rue Mondetour.\n\nEnjolras was thoughtful. It is impossible to say what grandiose shadows\nslowly spread over his redoubtable serenity. All at once he raised his\nvoice.\n\nA silence fell upon them.\n\n\"Citizens,\" said Enjolras, \"what that man did is frightful, what I have\ndone is horrible. He killed, therefore I killed him. I had to do it,\nbecause insurrection must have its discipline. Assassination is even\nmore of a crime here than elsewhere; we are under the eyes of the\nRevolution, we are the priests of the Republic, we are the victims of\nduty, and must not be possible to slander our combat. I have, therefore,\ntried that man, and condemned him to death. As for myself, constrained\nas I am to do what I have done, and yet abhorring it, I have judged\nmyself also, and you shall soon see to what I have condemned myself.\"\n\nThose who listened to him shuddered.\n\n\"We will share thy fate,\" cried Combeferre.\n\n\"So be it,\" replied Enjolras. \"One word more. In executing this man,\nI have obeyed necessity; but necessity is a monster of the old world,\nnecessity's name is Fatality. Now, the law of progress is, that monsters\nshall disappear before the angels, and that Fatality shall vanish before\nFraternity. It is a bad moment to pronounce the word love. No matter, I\ndo pronounce it. And I glorify it. Love, the future is thine. Death, I\nmake use of thee, but I hate thee. Citizens, in the future there will\nbe neither darkness nor thunderbolts; neither ferocious ignorance, nor\nbloody retaliation. As there will be no more Satan, there will be no\nmore Michael. In the future no one will kill any one else, the earth\nwill beam with radiance, the human race will love. The day will come,\ncitizens, when all will be concord, harmony, light, joy and life; it\nwill come, and it is in order that it may come that we are about to\ndie.\"\n\nEnjolras ceased. His virgin lips closed; and he remained for some time\nstanding on the spot where he had shed blood, in marble immobility. His\nstaring eye caused those about him to speak in low tones.\n\nJean Prouvaire and Combeferre pressed each other's hands silently, and,\nleaning against each other in an angle of the barricade, they watched\nwith an admiration in which there was some compassion, that grave young\nman, executioner and priest, composed of light, like crystal, and also\nof rock.\n\nLet us say at once that later on, after the action, when the bodies were\ntaken to the morgue and searched, a police agent's card was found on Le\nCabuc. The author of this book had in his hands, in 1848, the special\nreport on this subject made to the Prefect of Police in 1832.\n\nWe will add, that if we are to believe a tradition of the police, which\nis strange but probably well founded, Le Cabuc was Claquesous. The fact\nis, that dating from the death of Le Cabuc, there was no longer any\nquestion of Claquesous. Claquesous had nowhere left any trace of his\ndisappearance; he would seem to have amalgamated himself with the\ninvisible. His life had been all shadows, his end was night.\n\nThe whole insurgent group was still under the influence of the emotion\nof that tragic case which had been so quickly tried and so quickly\nterminated, when Courfeyrac again beheld on the barricade, the small\nyoung man who had inquired of him that morning for Marius.\n\nThis lad, who had a bold and reckless air, had come by night to join the\ninsurgents.\n\n\n\n\nBOOK THIRTEENTH.--MARIUS ENTERS THE SHADOW\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I--FROM THE RUE PLUMET TO THE QUARTIER SAINT-DENIS\n\nThe voice which had summoned Marius through the twilight to the\nbarricade of the Rue de la Chanvrerie, had produced on him the effect\nof the voice of destiny. He wished to die; the opportunity presented\nitself; he knocked at the door of the tomb, a hand in the darkness\noffered him the key. These melancholy openings which take place in the\ngloom before despair, are tempting. Marius thrust aside the bar which\nhad so often allowed him to pass, emerged from the garden, and said: \"I\nwill go.\"\n\nMad with grief, no longer conscious of anything fixed or solid in his\nbrain, incapable of accepting anything thenceforth of fate after those\ntwo months passed in the intoxication of youth and love, overwhelmed at\nonce by all the reveries of despair, he had but one desire remaining, to\nmake a speedy end of all.\n\nHe set out at rapid pace. He found himself most opportunely armed, as he\nhad Javert's pistols with him.\n\nThe young man of whom he thought that he had caught a glimpse, had\nvanished from his sight in the street.\n\nMarius, who had emerged from the Rue Plumet by the boulevard, traversed\nthe Esplanade and the bridge of the Invalides, the Champs Elysees, the\nPlace Louis XV., and reached the Rue de Rivoli. The shops were open\nthere, the gas was burning under the arcades, women were making their\npurchases in the stalls, people were eating ices in the Cafe Laiter,\nand nibbling small cakes at the English pastry-cook's shop. Only a few\nposting-chaises were setting out at a gallop from the Hotel des Princes\nand the Hotel Meurice.\n\nMarius entered the Rue Saint-Honore through the Passage Delorme. There\nthe shops were closed, the merchants were chatting in front of their\nhalf-open doors, people were walking about, the street lanterns were\nlighted, beginning with the first floor, all the windows were lighted as\nusual. There was cavalry on the Place du Palais-Royal.\n\nMarius followed the Rue Saint-Honore. In proportion as he left the\nPalais-Royal behind him, there were fewer lighted windows, the shops\nwere fast shut, no one was chatting on the thresholds, the street grew\nsombre, and, at the same time, the crowd increased in density. For the\npassers-by now amounted to a crowd. No one could be seen to speak in\nthis throng, and yet there arose from it a dull, deep murmur.\n\nNear the fountain of the Arbre-Sec, there were \"assemblages\", motionless\nand gloomy groups which were to those who went and came as stones in the\nmidst of running water.\n\nAt the entrance to the Rue des Prouvaires, the crowd no longer walked.\nIt formed a resisting, massive, solid, compact, almost impenetrable\nblock of people who were huddled together, and conversing in low tones.\nThere were hardly any black coats or round hats now, but smock frocks,\nblouses, caps, and bristling and cadaverous heads. This multitude\nundulated confusedly in the nocturnal gloom. Its whisperings had the\nhoarse accent of a vibration. Although not one of them was walking, a\ndull trampling was audible in the mire. Beyond this dense portion of\nthe throng, in the Rue du Roule, in the Rue des Prouvaires, and in the\nextension of the Rue Saint-Honore, there was no longer a single window\nin which a candle was burning. Only the solitary and diminishing rows\nof lanterns could be seen vanishing into the street in the distance. The\nlanterns of that date resembled large red stars, hanging to ropes, and\nshed upon the pavement a shadow which had the form of a huge spider.\nThese streets were not deserted. There could be descried piles of guns,\nmoving bayonets, and troops bivouacking. No curious observer passed that\nlimit. There circulation ceased. There the rabble ended and the army\nbegan.\n\nMarius willed with the will of a man who hopes no more. He had been\nsummoned, he must go. He found a means to traverse the throng and to\npass the bivouac of the troops, he shunned the patrols, he avoided the\nsentinels. He made a circuit, reached the Rue de Bethisy, and directed\nhis course towards the Halles. At the corner of the Rue des Bourdonnais,\nthere were no longer any lanterns.\n\nAfter having passed the zone of the crowd, he had passed the limits of\nthe troops; he found himself in something startling. There was no longer\na passer-by, no longer a soldier, no longer a light, there was no one;\nsolitude, silence, night, I know not what chill which seized hold upon\none. Entering a street was like entering a cellar.\n\nHe continued to advance.\n\nHe took a few steps. Some one passed close to him at a run. Was it a\nman? Or a woman? Were there many of them? he could not have told. It had\npassed and vanished.\n\nProceeding from circuit to circuit, he reached a lane which he judged\nto be the Rue de la Poterie; near the middle of this street, he came in\ncontact with an obstacle. He extended his hands. It was an overturned\nwagon; his foot recognized pools of water, gullies, and paving-stones\nscattered and piled up. A barricade had been begun there and abandoned.\nHe climbed over the stones and found himself on the other side of the\nbarrier. He walked very near the street-posts, and guided himself along\nthe walls of the houses. A little beyond the barricade, it seemed to him\nthat he could make out something white in front of him. He approached,\nit took on a form. It was two white horses; the horses of the omnibus\nharnessed by Bossuet in the morning, who had been straying at random all\nday from street to street, and had finally halted there, with the weary\npatience of brutes who no more understand the actions of men, than man\nunderstands the actions of Providence.\n\nMarius left the horses behind him. As he was approaching a street which\nseemed to him to be the Rue du Contrat-Social, a shot coming no one\nknows whence, and traversing the darkness at random, whistled close by\nhim, and the bullet pierced a brass shaving-dish suspended above his\nhead over a hairdresser's shop. This pierced shaving-dish was still\nto be seen in 1848, in the Rue du Contrat-Social, at the corner of the\npillars of the market.\n\nThis shot still betokened life. From that instant forth he encountered\nnothing more.\n\nThe whole of this itinerary resembled a descent of black steps.\n\nNevertheless, Marius pressed forward.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II--AN OWL'S VIEW OF PARIS\n\nA being who could have hovered over Paris that night with the wing of\nthe bat or the owl would have had beneath his eyes a gloomy spectacle.\n\nAll that old quarter of the Halles, which is like a city within a\ncity, through which run the Rues Saint-Denis and Saint-Martin, where a\nthousand lanes cross, and of which the insurgents had made their\nredoubt and their stronghold, would have appeared to him like a dark and\nenormous cavity hollowed out in the centre of Paris. There the glance\nfell into an abyss. Thanks to the broken lanterns, thanks to the closed\nwindows, there all radiance, all life, all sound, all movement ceased.\nThe invisible police of the insurrection were on the watch everywhere,\nand maintained order, that is to say, night. The necessary tactics of\ninsurrection are to drown small numbers in a vast obscurity, to multiply\nevery combatant by the possibilities which that obscurity contains. At\ndusk, every window where a candle was burning received a shot. The light\nwas extinguished, sometimes the inhabitant was killed. Hence nothing was\nstirring. There was nothing but fright, mourning, stupor in the houses;\nand in the streets, a sort of sacred horror. Not even the long rows of\nwindows and stores, the indentations of the chimneys, and the roofs,\nand the vague reflections which are cast back by the wet and muddy\npavements, were visible. An eye cast upward at that mass of shadows\nmight, perhaps, have caught a glimpse here and there, at intervals,\nof indistinct gleams which brought out broken and eccentric lines, and\nprofiles of singular buildings, something like the lights which go and\ncome in ruins; it was at such points that the barricades were situated.\nThe rest was a lake of obscurity, foggy, heavy, and funereal, above\nwhich, in motionless and melancholy outlines, rose the tower of\nSaint-Jacques, the church of Saint-Merry, and two or three more of those\ngrand edifices of which man makes giants and the night makes phantoms.\n\nAll around this deserted and disquieting labyrinth, in the quarters\nwhere the Parisian circulation had not been annihilated, and where a\nfew street lanterns still burned, the aerial observer might have\ndistinguished the metallic gleam of swords and bayonets, the dull rumble\nof artillery, and the swarming of silent battalions whose ranks were\nswelling from minute to minute; a formidable girdle which was slowly\ndrawing in and around the insurrection.\n\nThe invested quarter was no longer anything more than a monstrous\ncavern; everything there appeared to be asleep or motionless, and, as we\nhave just seen, any street which one might come to offered nothing but\ndarkness.\n\nA wild darkness, full of traps, full of unseen and formidable shocks,\ninto which it was alarming to penetrate, and in which it was terrible to\nremain, where those who entered shivered before those whom they awaited,\nwhere those who waited shuddered before those who were coming. Invisible\ncombatants were entrenched at every corner of the street; snares of the\nsepulchre concealed in the density of night. All was over. No more\nlight was to be hoped for, henceforth, except the lightning of guns,\nno further encounter except the abrupt and rapid apparition of death.\nWhere? How? When? No one knew, but it was certain and inevitable. In\nthis place which had been marked out for the struggle, the Government\nand the insurrection, the National Guard, and popular societies, the\nbourgeois and the uprising, groping their way, were about to come into\ncontact. The necessity was the same for both. The only possible issue\nthenceforth was to emerge thence killed or conquerors. A situation so\nextreme, an obscurity so powerful, that the most timid felt themselves\nseized with resolution, and the most daring with terror.\n\nMoreover, on both sides, the fury, the rage, and the determination were\nequal. For the one party, to advance meant death, and no one dreamed of\nretreating; for the other, to remain meant death, and no one dreamed of\nflight.\n\nIt was indispensable that all should be ended on the following day, that\ntriumph should rest either here or there, that the insurrection should\nprove itself a revolution or a skirmish. The Government understood this\nas well as the parties; the most insignificant bourgeois felt it. Hence\na thought of anguish which mingled with the impenetrable gloom of this\nquarter where all was at the point of being decided; hence a redoubled\nanxiety around that silence whence a catastrophe was on the point of\nemerging. Here only one sound was audible, a sound as heart-rending\nas the death rattle, as menacing as a malediction, the tocsin of\nSaint-Merry. Nothing could be more blood-curdling than the clamor of\nthat wild and desperate bell, wailing amid the shadows.\n\nAs it often happens, nature seemed to have fallen into accord with what\nmen were about to do. Nothing disturbed the harmony of the whole effect.\nThe stars had disappeared, heavy clouds filled the horizon with their\nmelancholy folds. A black sky rested on these dead streets, as though an\nimmense winding-sheet were being outspread over this immense tomb.\n\nWhile a battle that was still wholly political was in preparation in the\nsame locality which had already witnessed so many revolutionary events,\nwhile youth, the secret associations, the schools, in the name of\nprinciples, and the middle classes, in the name of interests, were\napproaching preparatory to dashing themselves together, clasping and\nthrowing each other, while each one hastened and invited the last and\ndecisive hour of the crisis, far away and quite outside of this fatal\nquarter, in the most profound depths of the unfathomable cavities of\nthat wretched old Paris which disappears under the splendor of happy\nand opulent Paris, the sombre voice of the people could be heard giving\nutterance to a dull roar.\n\nA fearful and sacred voice which is composed of the roar of the brute\nand of the word of God, which terrifies the weak and which warns the\nwise, which comes both from below like the voice of the lion, and from\non high like the voice of the thunder.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III--THE EXTREME EDGE\n\nMarius had reached the Halles.\n\nThere everything was still calmer, more obscure and more motionless than\nin the neighboring streets. One would have said that the glacial peace\nof the sepulchre had sprung forth from the earth and had spread over the\nheavens.\n\nNevertheless, a red glow brought out against this black background the\nlofty roofs of the houses which barred the Rue de la Chanvrerie on\nthe Saint-Eustache side. It was the reflection of the torch which was\nburning in the Corinthe barricade. Marius directed his steps towards\nthat red light. It had drawn him to the Marche-aux-Poirees, and he\ncaught a glimpse of the dark mouth of the Rue des Precheurs. He entered\nit. The insurgents' sentinel, who was guarding the other end, did not\nsee him. He felt that he was very close to that which he had come in\nsearch of, and he walked on tiptoe. In this manner he reached the elbow\nof that short section of the Rue Mondetour which was, as the reader will\nremember, the only communication which Enjolras had preserved with the\noutside world. At the corner of the last house, on his left, he thrust\nhis head forward, and looked into the fragment of the Rue Mondetour.\n\nA little beyond the angle of the lane and the Rue de la Chanvrerie which\ncast a broad curtain of shadow, in which he was himself engulfed,\nhe perceived some light on the pavement, a bit of the wine-shop, and\nbeyond, a flickering lamp within a sort of shapeless wall, and men\ncrouching down with guns on their knees. All this was ten fathoms\ndistant from him. It was the interior of the barricade.\n\nThe houses which bordered the lane on the right concealed the rest of\nthe wine-shop, the large barricade, and the flag from him.\n\nMarius had but a step more to take.\n\nThen the unhappy young man seated himself on a post, folded his arms,\nand fell to thinking about his father.\n\nHe thought of that heroic Colonel Pontmercy, who had been so proud a\nsoldier, who had guarded the frontier of France under the Republic, and\nhad touched the frontier of Asia under Napoleon, who had beheld Genoa,\nAlexandria, Milan, Turin, Madrid, Vienna, Dresden, Berlin, Moscow, who\nhad left on all the victorious battle-fields of Europe drops of that\nsame blood, which he, Marius, had in his veins, who had grown gray\nbefore his time in discipline and command, who had lived with his\nsword-belt buckled, his epaulets falling on his breast, his cockade\nblackened with powder, his brow furrowed with his helmet, in barracks,\nin camp, in the bivouac, in ambulances, and who, at the expiration of\ntwenty years, had returned from the great wars with a scarred cheek, a\nsmiling countenance, tranquil, admirable, pure as a child, having done\neverything for France and nothing against her.\n\nHe said to himself that his day had also come now, that his hour had\nstruck, that following his father, he too was about to show himself\nbrave, intrepid, bold, to run to meet the bullets, to offer his breast\nto bayonets, to shed his blood, to seek the enemy, to seek death, that\nhe was about to wage war in his turn and descend to the field of battle,\nand that the field of battle upon which he was to descend was the\nstreet, and that the war in which he was about to engage was civil war!\n\nHe beheld civil war laid open like a gulf before him, and into this he\nwas about to fall. Then he shuddered.\n\nHe thought of his father's sword, which his grandfather had sold to a\nsecond-hand dealer, and which he had so mournfully regretted. He said to\nhimself that that chaste and valiant sword had done well to escape from\nhim, and to depart in wrath into the gloom; that if it had thus fled, it\nwas because it was intelligent and because it had foreseen the future;\nthat it had had a presentiment of this rebellion, the war of the\ngutters, the war of the pavements, fusillades through cellar-windows,\nblows given and received in the rear; it was because, coming from\nMarengo and Friedland, it did not wish to go to the Rue de la\nChanvrerie; it was because, after what it had done with the father, it\ndid not wish to do this for the son! He told himself that if that sword\nwere there, if after taking possession of it at his father's pillow,\nhe had dared to take it and carry it off for this combat of darkness\nbetween Frenchmen in the streets, it would assuredly have scorched his\nhands and burst out aflame before his eyes, like the sword of the angel!\nHe told himself that it was fortunate that it was not there and that\nit had disappeared, that that was well, that that was just, that his\ngrandfather had been the true guardian of his father's glory, and that\nit was far better that the colonel's sword should be sold at auction,\nsold to the old-clothes man, thrown among the old junk, than that it\nshould, to-day, wound the side of his country.\n\nAnd then he fell to weeping bitterly.\n\nThis was horrible. But what was he to do? Live without Cosette he could\nnot. Since she was gone, he must needs die. Had he not given her his\nword of honor that he would die? She had gone knowing that; this meant\nthat it pleased her that Marius should die. And then, it was clear that\nshe no longer loved him, since she had departed thus without warning,\nwithout a word, without a letter, although she knew his address! What\nwas the good of living, and why should he live now? And then, what!\nshould he retreat after going so far? should he flee from danger after\nhaving approached it? should he slip away after having come and peeped\ninto the barricade? slip away, all in a tremble, saying: \"After all, I\nhave had enough of it as it is. I have seen it, that suffices, this is\ncivil war, and I shall take my leave!\" Should he abandon his friends who\nwere expecting him? Who were in need of him possibly! who were a mere\nhandful against an army! Should he be untrue at once to his love, to\ncountry, to his word? Should he give to his cowardice the pretext of\npatriotism? But this was impossible, and if the phantom of his father\nwas there in the gloom, and beheld him retreating, he would beat him on\nthe loins with the flat of his sword, and shout to him: \"March on, you\npoltroon!\"\n\nThus a prey to the conflicting movements of his thoughts, he dropped his\nhead.\n\nAll at once he raised it. A sort of splendid rectification had just been\neffected in his mind. There is a widening of the sphere of thought which\nis peculiar to the vicinity of the grave; it makes one see clearly to\nbe near death. The vision of the action into which he felt that he\nwas, perhaps, on the point of entering, appeared to him no more\nas lamentable, but as superb. The war of the street was suddenly\ntransfigured by some unfathomable inward working of his soul, before the\neye of his thought. All the tumultuous interrogation points of revery\nrecurred to him in throngs, but without troubling him. He left none of\nthem unanswered.\n\nLet us see, why should his father be indignant? Are there not cases\nwhere insurrection rises to the dignity of duty? What was there that was\ndegrading for the son of Colonel Pontmercy in the combat which was about\nto begin? It is no longer Montmirail nor Champaubert; it is something\nquite different. The question is no longer one of sacred territory,--but\nof a holy idea. The country wails, that may be, but humanity applauds.\nBut is it true that the country does wail? France bleeds, but liberty\nsmiles; and in the presence of liberty's smile, France forgets her\nwound. And then if we look at things from a still more lofty point of\nview, why do we speak of civil war?\n\nCivil war--what does that mean? Is there a foreign war? Is not all war\nbetween men, war between brothers? War is qualified only by its object.\nThere is no such thing as foreign or civil war; there is only just and\nunjust war. Until that day when the grand human agreement is concluded,\nwar, that at least which is the effort of the future, which is hastening\non against the past, which is lagging in the rear, may be necessary.\nWhat have we to reproach that war with? War does not become a disgrace,\nthe sword does not become a disgrace, except when it is used for\nassassinating the right, progress, reason, civilization, truth. Then\nwar, whether foreign or civil, is iniquitous; it is called crime.\nOutside the pale of that holy thing, justice, by what right does\none form of man despise another? By what right should the sword of\nWashington disown the pike of Camille Desmoulins? Leonidas against the\nstranger, Timoleon against the tyrant, which is the greater? the one is\nthe defender, the other the liberator. Shall we brand every appeal\nto arms within a city's limits without taking the object into a\nconsideration? Then note the infamy of Brutus, Marcel, Arnould von\nBlankenheim, Coligny, Hedgerow war? War of the streets? Why not? That\nwas the war of Ambiorix, of Artevelde, of Marnix, of Pelagius. But\nAmbiorix fought against Rome, Artevelde against France, Marnix against\nSpain, Pelagius against the Moors; all against the foreigner. Well, the\nmonarchy is a foreigner; oppression is a stranger; the right divine is\na stranger. Despotism violates the moral frontier, an invasion violates\nthe geographical frontier. Driving out the tyrant or driving out the\nEnglish, in both cases, regaining possession of one's own territory.\nThere comes an hour when protestation no longer suffices; after\nphilosophy, action is required; live force finishes what the idea\nhas sketched out; Prometheus chained begins, Arostogeiton ends; the\nencyclopedia enlightens souls, the 10th of August electrifies them.\nAfter AEschylus, Thrasybulus; after Diderot, Danton. Multitudes have\na tendency to accept the master. Their mass bears witness to apathy.\nA crowd is easily led as a whole to obedience. Men must be stirred up,\npushed on, treated roughly by the very benefit of their deliverance,\ntheir eyes must be wounded by the true, light must be hurled at them\nin terrible handfuls. They must be a little thunderstruck themselves at\ntheir own well-being; this dazzling awakens them. Hence the necessity\nof tocsins and wars. Great combatants must rise, must enlighten nations\nwith audacity, and shake up that sad humanity which is covered\nwith gloom by the right divine, Caesarian glory, force, fanaticism,\nirresponsible power, and absolute majesty; a rabble stupidly occupied in\nthe contemplation, in their twilight splendor, of these sombre triumphs\nof the night. Down with the tyrant! Of whom are you speaking? Do you\ncall Louis Philippe the tyrant? No; no more than Louis XVI. Both of them\nare what history is in the habit of calling good kings; but principles\nare not to be parcelled out, the logic of the true is rectilinear, the\npeculiarity of truth is that it lacks complaisance; no concessions,\nthen; all encroachments on man should be repressed. There is a divine\nright in Louis XVI., there is because a Bourbon in Louis Philippe; both\nrepresent in a certain measure the confiscation of right, and, in order\nto clear away universal insurrection, they must be combated; it must\nbe done, France being always the one to begin. When the master falls\nin France, he falls everywhere. In short, what cause is more just, and\nconsequently, what war is greater, than that which re-establishes\nsocial truth, restores her throne to liberty, restores the people to the\npeople, restores sovereignty to man, replaces the purple on the head of\nFrance, restores equity and reason in their plenitude, suppresses every\ngerm of antagonism by restoring each one to himself, annihilates the\nobstacle which royalty presents to the whole immense universal concord,\nand places the human race once more on a level with the right? These\nwars build up peace. An enormous fortress of prejudices, privileges,\nsuperstitions, lies, exactions, abuses, violences, iniquities, and\ndarkness still stands erect in this world, with its towers of hatred.\nIt must be cast down. This monstrous mass must be made to crumble. To\nconquer at Austerlitz is grand; to take the Bastille is immense.\n\nThere is no one who has not noticed it in his own case--the soul,--and\ntherein lies the marvel of its unity complicated with ubiquity, has\na strange aptitude for reasoning almost coldly in the most violent\nextremities, and it often happens that heartbroken passion and profound\ndespair in the very agony of their blackest monologues, treat subjects\nand discuss theses. Logic is mingled with convulsion, and the thread\nof the syllogism floats, without breaking, in the mournful storm of\nthought. This was the situation of Marius' mind.\n\nAs he meditated thus, dejected but resolute, hesitating in every\ndirection, and, in short, shuddering at what he was about to do, his\nglance strayed to the interior of the barricade. The insurgents\nwere here conversing in a low voice, without moving, and there\nwas perceptible that quasi-silence which marks the last stage of\nexpectation. Overhead, at the small window in the third story Marius\ndescried a sort of spectator who appeared to him to be singularly\nattentive. This was the porter who had been killed by Le Cabuc. Below,\nby the lights of the torch, which was thrust between the paving-stones,\nthis head could be vaguely distinguished. Nothing could be stranger, in\nthat sombre and uncertain gleam, than that livid, motionless, astonished\nface, with its bristling hair, its eyes fixed and staring, and its\nyawning mouth, bent over the street in an attitude of curiosity. One\nwould have said that the man who was dead was surveying those who were\nabout to die. A long trail of blood which had flowed from that head,\ndescended in reddish threads from the window to the height of the first\nfloor, where it stopped.\n\n\n\n\nBOOK FOURTEENTH.--THE GRANDEURS OF DESPAIR\n\n[Illustration: The Grandeurs of Despair 4b-14-1-despair]\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I--THE FLAG: ACT FIRST\n\nAs yet, nothing had come. Ten o'clock had sounded from Saint-Merry.\nEnjolras and Combeferre had gone and seated themselves, carbines in\nhand, near the outlet of the grand barricade. They no longer addressed\neach other, they listened, seeking to catch even the faintest and most\ndistant sound of marching.\n\nSuddenly, in the midst of the dismal calm, a clear, gay, young voice,\nwhich seemed to come from the Rue Saint-Denis, rose and began to sing\ndistinctly, to the old popular air of \"By the Light of the Moon,\" this\nbit of poetry, terminated by a cry like the crow of a cock:--\n\n               Mon nez est en larmes,\n               Mon ami Bugeaud,\n               Prete moi tes gendarmes\n               Pour leur dire un mot.\n\n                  En capote bleue,\n                  La poule au shako,\n                  Voici la banlieue!\n                  Co-cocorico![54]\n\n\nThey pressed each other's hands.\n\n\"That is Gavroche,\" said Enjolras.\n\n\"He is warning us,\" said Combeferre.\n\nA hasty rush troubled the deserted street; they beheld a being more\nagile than a clown climb over the omnibus, and Gavroche bounded into the\nbarricade, all breathless, saying:--\n\n\"My gun! Here they are!\"\n\nAn electric quiver shot through the whole barricade, and the sound of\nhands seeking their guns became audible.\n\n\"Would you like my carbine?\" said Enjolras to the lad.\n\n\"I want a big gun,\" replied Gavroche.\n\nAnd he seized Javert's gun.\n\nTwo sentinels had fallen back, and had come in almost at the same moment\nas Gavroche. They were the sentinels from the end of the street, and the\nvidette of the Rue de la Petite-Truanderie. The vidette of the Lane des\nPrecheurs had remained at his post, which indicated that nothing was\napproaching from the direction of the bridges and Halles.\n\nThe Rue de la Chanvrerie, of which a few paving-stones alone were dimly\nvisible in the reflection of the light projected on the flag, offered\nto the insurgents the aspect of a vast black door vaguely opened into a\nsmoke.\n\nEach man had taken up his position for the conflict.\n\nForty-three insurgents, among whom were Enjolras, Combeferre,\nCourfeyrac, Bossuet, Joly, Bahorel, and Gavroche, were kneeling inside\nthe large barricade, with their heads on a level with the crest of the\nbarrier, the barrels of their guns and carbines aimed on the stones as\nthough at loop-holes, attentive, mute, ready to fire. Six, commanded\nby Feuilly, had installed themselves, with their guns levelled at their\nshoulders, at the windows of the two stories of Corinthe.\n\nSeveral minutes passed thus, then a sound of footsteps, measured, heavy,\nand numerous, became distinctly audible in the direction of Saint-Leu.\nThis sound, faint at first, then precise, then heavy and sonorous,\napproached slowly, without halt, without intermission, with a tranquil\nand terrible continuity. Nothing was to be heard but this. It was that\ncombined silence and sound, of the statue of the commander, but this\nstony step had something indescribably enormous and multiple about it\nwhich awakened the idea of a throng, and, at the same time, the idea\nof a spectre. One thought one heard the terrible statue Legion marching\nonward. This tread drew near; it drew still nearer, and stopped. It\nseemed as though the breathing of many men could be heard at the end of\nthe street. Nothing was to be seen, however, but at the bottom of that\ndense obscurity there could be distinguished a multitude of metallic\nthreads, as fine as needles and almost imperceptible, which moved about\nlike those indescribable phosphoric networks which one sees beneath\none's closed eyelids, in the first mists of slumber at the moment\nwhen one is dropping off to sleep. These were bayonets and gun-barrels\nconfusedly illuminated by the distant reflection of the torch.\n\nA pause ensued, as though both sides were waiting. All at once, from the\ndepths of this darkness, a voice, which was all the more sinister, since\nno one was visible, and which appeared to be the gloom itself speaking,\nshouted:--\n\n\"Who goes there?\"\n\nAt the same time, the click of guns, as they were lowered into position,\nwas heard.\n\nEnjolras replied in a haughty and vibrating tone:--\n\n\"The French Revolution!\"\n\n\"Fire!\" shouted the voice.\n\nA flash empurpled all the facades in the street as though the door of a\nfurnace had been flung open, and hastily closed again.\n\nA fearful detonation burst forth on the barricade. The red flag fell.\nThe discharge had been so violent and so dense that it had cut the\nstaff, that is to say, the very tip of the omnibus pole.\n\nBullets which had rebounded from the cornices of the houses penetrated\nthe barricade and wounded several men.\n\nThe impression produced by this first discharge was freezing. The attack\nhad been rough, and of a nature to inspire reflection in the boldest.\nIt was evident that they had to deal with an entire regiment at the very\nleast.\n\n\"Comrades!\" shouted Courfeyrac, \"let us not waste our powder. Let us\nwait until they are in the street before replying.\"\n\n\"And, above all,\" said Enjolras, \"let us raise the flag again.\"\n\nHe picked up the flag, which had fallen precisely at his feet.\n\nOutside, the clatter of the ramrods in the guns could be heard; the\ntroops were re-loading their arms.\n\nEnjolras went on:--\n\n\"Who is there here with a bold heart? Who will plant the flag on the\nbarricade again?\"\n\nNot a man responded. To mount on the barricade at the very moment when,\nwithout any doubt, it was again the object of their aim, was simply\ndeath. The bravest hesitated to pronounce his own condemnation. Enjolras\nhimself felt a thrill. He repeated:--\n\n\"Does no one volunteer?\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II--THE FLAG: ACT SECOND\n\nSince they had arrived at Corinthe, and had begun the construction of\nthe barricade, no attention had been paid to Father Mabeuf. M. Mabeuf\nhad not quitted the mob, however; he had entered the ground-floor of the\nwine-shop and had seated himself behind the counter. There he had, so to\nspeak, retreated into himself. He no longer seemed to look or to think.\nCourfeyrac and others had accosted him two or three times, warning him\nof his peril, beseeching him to withdraw, but he did not hear them.\nWhen they were not speaking to him, his mouth moved as though he were\nreplying to some one, and as soon as he was addressed, his lips became\nmotionless and his eyes no longer had the appearance of being alive.\n\nSeveral hours before the barricade was attacked, he had assumed an\nattitude which he did not afterwards abandon, with both fists planted\non his knees and his head thrust forward as though he were gazing over a\nprecipice. Nothing had been able to move him from this attitude; it did\nnot seem as though his mind were in the barricade. When each had gone\nto take up his position for the combat, there remained in the tap-room\nwhere Javert was bound to the post, only a single insurgent with a naked\nsword, watching over Javert, and himself, Mabeuf. At the moment of the\nattack, at the detonation, the physical shock had reached him and had,\nas it were, awakened him; he started up abruptly, crossed the room,\nand at the instant when Enjolras repeated his appeal: \"Does no one\nvolunteer?\" the old man was seen to make his appearance on the threshold\nof the wine-shop. His presence produced a sort of commotion in the\ndifferent groups. A shout went up:--\n\n\"It is the voter! It is the member of the Convention! It is the\nrepresentative of the people!\"\n\nIt is probable that he did not hear them.\n\nHe strode straight up to Enjolras, the insurgents withdrawing before him\nwith a religious fear; he tore the flag from Enjolras, who recoiled in\namazement and then, since no one dared to stop or to assist him, this\nold man of eighty, with shaking head but firm foot, began slowly to\nascend the staircase of paving-stones arranged in the barricade. This\nwas so melancholy and so grand that all around him cried: \"Off with your\nhats!\" At every step that he mounted, it was a frightful spectacle; his\nwhite locks, his decrepit face, his lofty, bald, and wrinkled brow,\nhis amazed and open mouth, his aged arm upholding the red banner, rose\nthrough the gloom and were enlarged in the bloody light of the torch,\nand the bystanders thought that they beheld the spectre of '93 emerging\nfrom the earth, with the flag of terror in his hand.\n\nWhen he had reached the last step, when this trembling and terrible\nphantom, erect on that pile of rubbish in the presence of twelve hundred\ninvisible guns, drew himself up in the face of death and as though\nhe were more powerful than it, the whole barricade assumed amid the\ndarkness, a supernatural and colossal form.\n\nThere ensued one of those silences which occur only in the presence of\nprodigies. In the midst of this silence, the old man waved the red flag\nand shouted:--\n\n\"Long live the Revolution! Long live the Republic! Fraternity! Equality!\nand Death!\"\n\nThose in the barricade heard a low and rapid whisper, like the murmur\nof a priest who is despatching a prayer in haste. It was probably the\ncommissary of police who was making the legal summons at the other end\nof the street.\n\nThen the same piercing voice which had shouted: \"Who goes there?\"\nshouted:--\n\n\"Retire!\"\n\nM. Mabeuf, pale, haggard, his eyes lighted up with the mournful flame of\naberration, raised the flag above his head and repeated:--\n\n\"Long live the Republic!\"\n\n\"Fire!\" said the voice.\n\nA second discharge, similar to the first, rained down upon the\nbarricade.\n\nThe old man fell on his knees, then rose again, dropped the flag\nand fell backwards on the pavement, like a log, at full length, with\noutstretched arms.\n\nRivulets of blood flowed beneath him. His aged head, pale and sad,\nseemed to be gazing at the sky.\n\nOne of those emotions which are superior to man, which make him forget\neven to defend himself, seized upon the insurgents, and they approached\nthe body with respectful awe.\n\n\"What men these regicides were!\" said Enjolras.\n\nCourfeyrac bent down to Enjolras' ear:--\n\n\"This is for yourself alone, I do not wish to dampen the enthusiasm. But\nthis man was anything rather than a regicide. I knew him. His name was\nFather Mabeuf. I do not know what was the matter with him to-day. But he\nwas a brave blockhead. Just look at his head.\"\n\n\"The head of a blockhead and the heart of a Brutus,\" replied Enjolras.\n\nThen he raised his voice:--\n\n\"Citizens! This is the example which the old give to the young. We\nhesitated, he came! We were drawing back, he advanced! This is what\nthose who are trembling with age teach to those who tremble with fear!\nThis aged man is august in the eyes of his country. He has had a long\nlife and a magnificent death! Now, let us place the body under cover,\nthat each one of us may defend this old man dead as he would his\nfather living, and may his presence in our midst render the barricade\nimpregnable!\"\n\nA murmur of gloomy and energetic assent followed these words.\n\nEnjolras bent down, raised the old man's head, and fierce as he was, he\nkissed him on the brow, then, throwing wide his arms, and handling this\ndead man with tender precaution, as though he feared to hurt it, he\nremoved his coat, showed the bloody holes in it to all, and said:--\n\n\"This is our flag now.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III--GAVROCHE WOULD HAVE DONE BETTER TO ACCEPT ENJOLRAS' CARBINE\n\nThey threw a long black shawl of Widow Hucheloup's over Father Mabeuf.\nSix men made a litter of their guns; on this they laid the body, and\nbore it, with bared heads, with solemn slowness, to the large table in\nthe tap-room.\n\nThese men, wholly absorbed in the grave and sacred task in which they\nwere engaged, thought no more of the perilous situation in which they\nstood.\n\nWhen the corpse passed near Javert, who was still impassive, Enjolras\nsaid to the spy:--\n\n\"It will be your turn presently!\"\n\nDuring all this time, Little Gavroche, who alone had not quitted his\npost, but had remained on guard, thought he espied some men stealthily\napproaching the barricade. All at once he shouted:--\n\n\"Look out!\"\n\nCourfeyrac, Enjolras, Jean Prouvaire, Combeferre, Joly, Bahorel,\nBossuet, and all the rest ran tumultuously from the wine-shop. It was\nalmost too late. They saw a glistening density of bayonets undulating\nabove the barricade. Municipal guards of lofty stature were making\ntheir way in, some striding over the omnibus, others through the cut,\nthrusting before them the urchin, who retreated, but did not flee.\n\nThe moment was critical. It was that first, redoubtable moment of\ninundation, when the stream rises to the level of the levee and when the\nwater begins to filter through the fissures of dike. A second more and\nthe barricade would have been taken.\n\nBahorel dashed upon the first municipal guard who was entering, and\nkilled him on the spot with a blow from his gun; the second killed\nBahorel with a blow from his bayonet. Another had already overthrown\nCourfeyrac, who was shouting: \"Follow me!\" The largest of all, a sort of\ncolossus, marched on Gavroche with his bayonet fixed. The urchin took in\nhis arms Javert's immense gun, levelled it resolutely at the giant, and\nfired. No discharge followed. Javert's gun was not loaded. The municipal\nguard burst into a laugh and raised his bayonet at the child.\n\nBefore the bayonet had touched Gavroche, the gun slipped from the\nsoldier's grasp, a bullet had struck the municipal guardsman in the\ncentre of the forehead, and he fell over on his back. A second bullet\nstruck the other guard, who had assaulted Courfeyrac in the breast, and\nlaid him low on the pavement.\n\nThis was the work of Marius, who had just entered the barricade.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV--THE BARREL OF POWDER\n\nMarius, still concealed in the turn of the Rue Mondetour, had witnessed,\nshuddering and irresolute, the first phase of the combat. But he had not\nlong been able to resist that mysterious and sovereign vertigo which may\nbe designated as the call of the abyss. In the presence of the imminence\nof the peril, in the presence of the death of M. Mabeuf, that melancholy\nenigma, in the presence of Bahorel killed, and Courfeyrac shouting:\n\"Follow me!\" of that child threatened, of his friends to succor or to\navenge, all hesitation had vanished, and he had flung himself into the\nconflict, his two pistols in hand. With his first shot he had saved\nGavroche, and with the second delivered Courfeyrac.\n\nAmid the sound of the shots, amid the cries of the assaulted guards,\nthe assailants had climbed the entrenchment, on whose summit Municipal\nGuards, soldiers of the line and National Guards from the suburbs could\nnow be seen, gun in hand, rearing themselves to more than half the\nheight of their bodies.\n\nThey already covered more than two-thirds of the barrier, but they did\nnot leap into the enclosure, as though wavering in the fear of some\ntrap. They gazed into the dark barricade as one would gaze into a lion's\nden. The light of the torch illuminated only their bayonets, their\nbear-skin caps, and the upper part of their uneasy and angry faces.\n\nMarius had no longer any weapons; he had flung away his discharged\npistols after firing them; but he had caught sight of the barrel of\npowder in the tap-room, near the door.\n\nAs he turned half round, gazing in that direction, a soldier took aim at\nhim. At the moment when the soldier was sighting Marius, a hand was laid\non the muzzle of the gun and obstructed it. This was done by some one\nwho had darted forward,--the young workman in velvet trousers. The shot\nsped, traversed the hand and possibly, also, the workman, since he fell,\nbut the ball did not strike Marius. All this, which was rather to be\napprehended than seen through the smoke, Marius, who was entering the\ntap-room, hardly noticed. Still, he had, in a confused way, perceived\nthat gun-barrel aimed at him, and the hand which had blocked it, and he\nhad heard the discharge. But in moments like this, the things which one\nsees vacillate and are precipitated, and one pauses for nothing. One\nfeels obscurely impelled towards more darkness still, and all is cloud.\n\nThe insurgents, surprised but not terrified, had rallied. Enjolras had\nshouted: \"Wait! Don't fire at random!\" In the first confusion, they\nmight, in fact, wound each other. The majority of them had ascended\nto the window on the first story and to the attic windows, whence they\ncommanded the assailants.\n\nThe most determined, with Enjolras, Courfeyrac, Jean Prouvaire, and\nCombeferre, had proudly placed themselves with their backs against the\nhouses at the rear, unsheltered and facing the ranks of soldiers and\nguards who crowned the barricade.\n\nAll this was accomplished without haste, with that strange and\nthreatening gravity which precedes engagements. They took aim, point\nblank, on both sides: they were so close that they could talk together\nwithout raising their voices.\n\nWhen they had reached this point where the spark is on the brink of\ndarting forth, an officer in a gorget extended his sword and said:--\n\n\"Lay down your arms!\"\n\n\"Fire!\" replied Enjolras.\n\nThe two discharges took place at the same moment, and all disappeared in\nsmoke.\n\nAn acrid and stifling smoke in which dying and wounded lay with weak,\ndull groans. When the smoke cleared away, the combatants on both sides\ncould be seen to be thinned out, but still in the same positions,\nreloading in silence. All at once, a thundering voice was heard,\nshouting:--\n\n\"Be off with you, or I'll blow up the barricade!\"\n\nAll turned in the direction whence the voice proceeded.\n\nMarius had entered the tap-room, and had seized the barrel of powder,\nthen he had taken advantage of the smoke, and the sort of obscure mist\nwhich filled the entrenched enclosure, to glide along the barricade as\nfar as that cage of paving-stones where the torch was fixed. To tear\nit from the torch, to replace it by the barrel of powder, to thrust the\npile of stones under the barrel, which was instantly staved in, with\na sort of horrible obedience,--all this had cost Marius but the time\nnecessary to stoop and rise again; and now all, National Guards,\nMunicipal Guards, officers, soldiers, huddled at the other extremity of\nthe barricade, gazed stupidly at him, as he stood with his foot on the\nstones, his torch in his hand, his haughty face illuminated by a fatal\nresolution, drooping the flame of the torch towards that redoubtable\npile where they could make out the broken barrel of powder, and giving\nvent to that startling cry:--\n\n\"Be off with you, or I'll blow up the barricade!\"\n\nMarius on that barricade after the octogenarian was the vision of the\nyoung revolution after the apparition of the old.\n\n\"Blow up the barricade!\" said a sergeant, \"and yourself with it!\"\n\nMarius retorted: \"And myself also.\"\n\nAnd he dropped the torch towards the barrel of powder.\n\nBut there was no longer any one on the barrier. The assailants,\nabandoning their dead and wounded, flowed back pell-mell and in disorder\ntowards the extremity of the street, and there were again lost in the\nnight. It was a headlong flight.\n\nThe barricade was free.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V--END OF THE VERSES OF JEAN PROUVAIRE\n\nAll flocked around Marius. Courfeyrac flung himself on his neck.\n\n\"Here you are!\"\n\n\"What luck!\" said Combeferre.\n\n\"You came in opportunely!\" ejaculated Bossuet.\n\n\"If it had not been for you, I should have been dead!\" began Courfeyrac\nagain.\n\n\"If it had not been for you, I should have been gobbled up!\" added\nGavroche.\n\nMarius asked:--\n\n\"Where is the chief?\"\n\n\"You are he!\" said Enjolras.\n\nMarius had had a furnace in his brain all day long; now it was a\nwhirlwind. This whirlwind which was within him, produced on him the\neffect of being outside of him and of bearing him away. It seemed to him\nthat he was already at an immense distance from life. His two luminous\nmonths of joy and love, ending abruptly at that frightful precipice,\nCosette lost to him, that barricade, M. Mabeuf getting himself killed\nfor the Republic, himself the leader of the insurgents,--all these\nthings appeared to him like a tremendous nightmare. He was obliged to\nmake a mental effort to recall the fact that all that surrounded him was\nreal. Marius had already seen too much of life not to know that nothing\nis more imminent than the impossible, and that what it is always\nnecessary to foresee is the unforeseen. He had looked on at his own\ndrama as a piece which one does not understand.\n\nIn the mists which enveloped his thoughts, he did not recognize Javert,\nwho, bound to his post, had not so much as moved his head during the\nwhole of the attack on the barricade, and who had gazed on the revolt\nseething around him with the resignation of a martyr and the majesty of\na judge. Marius had not even seen him.\n\nIn the meanwhile, the assailants did not stir, they could be heard\nmarching and swarming through at the end of the street but they did not\nventure into it, either because they were awaiting orders or because\nthey were awaiting reinforcements before hurling themselves afresh on\nthis impregnable redoubt. The insurgents had posted sentinels, and some\nof them, who were medical students, set about caring for the wounded.\n\nThey had thrown the tables out of the wine-shop, with the exception of\nthe two tables reserved for lint and cartridges, and of the one on\nwhich lay Father Mabeuf; they had added them to the barricade, and had\nreplaced them in the tap-room with mattresses from the bed of the\nwidow Hucheloup and her servants. On these mattresses they had laid the\nwounded. As for the three poor creatures who inhabited Corinthe, no one\nknew what had become of them. They were finally found, however, hidden\nin the cellar.\n\nA poignant emotion clouded the joy of the disencumbered barricade.\n\nThe roll was called. One of the insurgents was missing. And who was\nit? One of the dearest. One of the most valiant. Jean Prouvaire. He\nwas sought among the wounded, he was not there. He was sought among the\ndead, he was not there. He was evidently a prisoner. Combeferre said to\nEnjolras:--\n\n\"They have our friend; we have their agent. Are you set on the death of\nthat spy?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" replied Enjolras; \"but less so than on the life of Jean\nProuvaire.\"\n\nThis took place in the tap-room near Javert's post.\n\n\"Well,\" resumed Combeferre, \"I am going to fasten my handkerchief to\nmy cane, and go as a flag of truce, to offer to exchange our man for\ntheirs.\"\n\n\"Listen,\" said Enjolras, laying his hand on Combeferre's arm.\n\nAt the end of the street there was a significant clash of arms.\n\nThey heard a manly voice shout:--\n\n\"Vive la France! Long live France! Long live the future!\"\n\nThey recognized the voice of Prouvaire.\n\nA flash passed, a report rang out.\n\nSilence fell again.\n\n\"They have killed him,\" exclaimed Combeferre.\n\nEnjolras glanced at Javert, and said to him:--\n\n\"Your friends have just shot you.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI--THE AGONY OF DEATH AFTER THE AGONY OF LIFE\n\nA peculiarity of this species of war is, that the attack of the\nbarricades is almost always made from the front, and that the assailants\ngenerally abstain from turning the position, either because they\nfear ambushes, or because they are afraid of getting entangled in the\ntortuous streets. The insurgents' whole attention had been directed,\ntherefore, to the grand barricade, which was, evidently, the spot always\nmenaced, and there the struggle would infallibly recommence. But Marius\nthought of the little barricade, and went thither. It was deserted and\nguarded only by the fire-pot which trembled between the paving-stones.\nMoreover, the Mondetour alley, and the branches of the Rue de la Petite\nTruanderie and the Rue du Cygne were profoundly calm.\n\nAs Marius was withdrawing, after concluding his inspection, he heard his\nname pronounced feebly in the darkness.\n\n\"Monsieur Marius!\"\n\nHe started, for he recognized the voice which had called to him two\nhours before through the gate in the Rue Plumet.\n\nOnly, the voice now seemed to be nothing more than a breath.\n\nHe looked about him, but saw no one.\n\nMarius thought he had been mistaken, that it was an illusion added by\nhis mind to the extraordinary realities which were clashing around\nhim. He advanced a step, in order to quit the distant recess where the\nbarricade lay.\n\n\"Monsieur Marius!\" repeated the voice.\n\nThis time he could not doubt that he had heard it distinctly; he looked\nand saw nothing.\n\n\"At your feet,\" said the voice.\n\nHe bent down, and saw in the darkness a form which was dragging itself\ntowards him.\n\nIt was crawling along the pavement. It was this that had spoken to him.\n\nThe fire-pot allowed him to distinguish a blouse, torn trousers of\ncoarse velvet, bare feet, and something which resembled a pool of blood.\nMarius indistinctly made out a pale head which was lifted towards him\nand which was saying to him:--\n\n\"You do not recognize me?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Eponine.\"\n\nMarius bent hastily down. It was, in fact, that unhappy child. She was\ndressed in men's clothes.\n\n\"How come you here? What are you doing here?\"\n\n\"I am dying,\" said she.\n\nThere are words and incidents which arouse dejected beings. Marius cried\nout with a start:--\n\n\"You are wounded! Wait, I will carry you into the room! They will attend\nto you there. Is it serious? How must I take hold of you in order not\nto hurt you? Where do you suffer? Help! My God! But why did you come\nhither?\"\n\nAnd he tried to pass his arm under her, in order to raise her.\n\nShe uttered a feeble cry.\n\n\"Have I hurt you?\" asked Marius.\n\n\"A little.\"\n\n\"But I only touched your hand.\"\n\nShe raised her hand to Marius, and in the middle of that hand Marius saw\na black hole.\n\n\"What is the matter with your hand?\" said he.\n\n\"It is pierced.\"\n\n\"Pierced?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"What with?\"\n\n\"A bullet.\"\n\n\"How?\"\n\n\"Did you see a gun aimed at you?\"\n\n\"Yes, and a hand stopping it.\"\n\n\"It was mine.\"\n\nMarius was seized with a shudder.\n\n\"What madness! Poor child! But so much the better, if that is all, it is\nnothing, let me carry you to a bed. They will dress your wound; one does\nnot die of a pierced hand.\"\n\nShe murmured:--\n\n\"The bullet traversed my hand, but it came out through my back. It is\nuseless to remove me from this spot. I will tell you how you can care\nfor me better than any surgeon. Sit down near me on this stone.\"\n\nHe obeyed; she laid her head on Marius' knees, and, without looking at\nhim, she said:--\n\n\"Oh! How good this is! How comfortable this is! There; I no longer\nsuffer.\"\n\nShe remained silent for a moment, then she turned her face with an\neffort, and looked at Marius.\n\n\"Do you know what, Monsieur Marius? It puzzled me because you entered\nthat garden; it was stupid, because it was I who showed you that house;\nand then, I ought to have said to myself that a young man like you--\"\n\nShe paused, and overstepping the sombre transitions that undoubtedly\nexisted in her mind, she resumed with a heartrending smile:--\n\n\"You thought me ugly, didn't you?\"\n\nShe continued:--\n\n\"You see, you are lost! Now, no one can get out of the barricade. It was\nI who led you here, by the way! You are going to die, I count upon that.\nAnd yet, when I saw them taking aim at you, I put my hand on the muzzle\nof the gun. How queer it is! But it was because I wanted to die before\nyou. When I received that bullet, I dragged myself here, no one saw\nme, no one picked me up, I was waiting for you, I said: 'So he is not\ncoming!' Oh, if you only knew. I bit my blouse, I suffered so! Now I am\nwell. Do you remember the day I entered your chamber and when I\nlooked at myself in your mirror, and the day when I came to you on the\nboulevard near the washerwomen? How the birds sang! That was a long time\nago. You gave me a hundred sous, and I said to you: 'I don't want your\nmoney.' I hope you picked up your coin? You are not rich. I did not\nthink to tell you to pick it up. The sun was shining bright, and it was\nnot cold. Do you remember, Monsieur Marius? Oh! How happy I am! Every\none is going to die.\"\n\nShe had a mad, grave, and heart-breaking air. Her torn blouse disclosed\nher bare throat.\n\nAs she talked, she pressed her pierced hand to her breast, where there\nwas another hole, and whence there spurted from moment to moment a\nstream of blood, like a jet of wine from an open bung-hole.\n\nMarius gazed at this unfortunate creature with profound compassion.\n\n\"Oh!\" she resumed, \"it is coming again, I am stifling!\"\n\nShe caught up her blouse and bit it, and her limbs stiffened on the\npavement.\n\nAt that moment the young cock's crow executed by little Gavroche\nresounded through the barricade.\n\nThe child had mounted a table to load his gun, and was singing gayly the\nsong then so popular:--\n\n\n   \"En voyant Lafayette,             \"On beholding Lafayette,\n    Le gendarme repete:--             The gendarme repeats:--\n    Sauvons nous! sauvons nous!       Let us flee! let us flee!\n          sauvons nous!\"                     let us flee!\n\n\nEponine raised herself and listened; then she murmured:--\n\n\"It is he.\"\n\nAnd turning to Marius:--\n\n\"My brother is here. He must not see me. He would scold me.\"\n\n\"Your brother?\" inquired Marius, who was meditating in the most bitter\nand sorrowful depths of his heart on the duties to the Thenardiers which\nhis father had bequeathed to him; \"who is your brother?\"\n\n\"That little fellow.\"\n\n\"The one who is singing?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nMarius made a movement.\n\n\"Oh! don't go away,\" said she, \"it will not be long now.\"\n\nShe was sitting almost upright, but her voice was very low and broken by\nhiccoughs.\n\nAt intervals, the death rattle interrupted her. She put her face as near\nthat of Marius as possible. She added with a strange expression:--\n\n\"Listen, I do not wish to play you a trick. I have a letter in my pocket\nfor you. I was told to put it in the post. I kept it. I did not want to\nhave it reach you. But perhaps you will be angry with me for it when we\nmeet again presently? Take your letter.\"\n\nShe grasped Marius' hand convulsively with her pierced hand, but she no\nlonger seemed to feel her sufferings. She put Marius' hand in the pocket\nof her blouse. There, in fact, Marius felt a paper.\n\n\"Take it,\" said she.\n\nMarius took the letter.\n\nShe made a sign of satisfaction and contentment.\n\n\"Now, for my trouble, promise me--\"\n\nAnd she stopped.\n\n\"What?\" asked Marius.\n\n\"Promise me!\"\n\n\"I promise.\"\n\n\"Promise to give me a kiss on my brow when I am dead.--I shall feel it.\"\n\nShe dropped her head again on Marius' knees, and her eyelids closed. He\nthought the poor soul had departed. Eponine remained motionless. All\nat once, at the very moment when Marius fancied her asleep forever, she\nslowly opened her eyes in which appeared the sombre profundity of death,\nand said to him in a tone whose sweetness seemed already to proceed from\nanother world:--\n\n\"And by the way, Monsieur Marius, I believe that I was a little bit in\nlove with you.\"\n\nShe tried to smile once more and expired.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII--GAVROCHE AS A PROFOUND CALCULATOR OF DISTANCES\n\nMarius kept his promise. He dropped a kiss on that livid brow, where the\nicy perspiration stood in beads.\n\nThis was no infidelity to Cosette; it was a gentle and pensive farewell\nto an unhappy soul.\n\nIt was not without a tremor that he had taken the letter which Eponine\nhad given him. He had immediately felt that it was an event of weight.\nHe was impatient to read it. The heart of man is so constituted that the\nunhappy child had hardly closed her eyes when Marius began to think of\nunfolding this paper.\n\nHe laid her gently on the ground, and went away. Something told him that\nhe could not peruse that letter in the presence of that body.\n\nHe drew near to a candle in the tap-room. It was a small note, folded\nand sealed with a woman's elegant care. The address was in a woman's\nhand and ran:--\n\n\"To Monsieur, Monsieur Marius Pontmercy, at M. Courfeyrac's, Rue de la\nVerrerie, No. 16.\"\n\nHe broke the seal and read:--\n\n \"My dearest, alas! my father insists on our setting out immediately.\n We shall be this evening in the Rue de l'Homme Arme, No. 7.\n In a week we shall be in England.  COSETTE.  June 4th.\"\n\nSuch was the innocence of their love that Marius was not even acquainted\nwith Cosette's handwriting.\n\nWhat had taken place may be related in a few words. Eponine had been\nthe cause of everything. After the evening of the 3d of June she had\ncherished a double idea, to defeat the projects of her father and the\nruffians on the house of the Rue Plumet, and to separate Marius and\nCosette. She had exchanged rags with the first young scamp she came\nacross who had thought it amusing to dress like a woman, while Eponine\ndisguised herself like a man. It was she who had conveyed to Jean\nValjean in the Champ de Mars the expressive warning: \"Leave your house.\"\nJean Valjean had, in fact, returned home, and had said to Cosette:\n\"We set out this evening and we go to the Rue de l'Homme Arme with\nToussaint. Next week, we shall be in London.\" Cosette, utterly\noverwhelmed by this unexpected blow, had hastily penned a couple of\nlines to Marius. But how was she to get the letter to the post? She\nnever went out alone, and Toussaint, surprised at such a commission,\nwould certainly show the letter to M. Fauchelevent. In this dilemma,\nCosette had caught sight through the fence of Eponine in man's clothes,\nwho now prowled incessantly around the garden. Cosette had called to\n\"this young workman\" and had handed him five francs and the letter,\nsaying: \"Carry this letter immediately to its address.\" Eponine had put\nthe letter in her pocket. The next day, on the 5th of June, she went\nto Courfeyrac's quarters to inquire for Marius, not for the purpose of\ndelivering the letter, but,--a thing which every jealous and loving soul\nwill comprehend,--\"to see.\" There she had waited for Marius, or at least\nfor Courfeyrac, still for the purpose of seeing. When Courfeyrac had\ntold her: \"We are going to the barricades,\" an idea flashed through her\nmind, to fling herself into that death, as she would have done into any\nother, and to thrust Marius into it also. She had followed Courfeyrac,\nhad made sure of the locality where the barricade was in process of\nconstruction; and, quite certain, since Marius had received no warning,\nand since she had intercepted the letter, that he would go at dusk to\nhis trysting place for every evening, she had betaken herself to the Rue\nPlumet, had there awaited Marius, and had sent him, in the name of his\nfriends, the appeal which would, she thought, lead him to the barricade.\nShe reckoned on Marius' despair when he should fail to find Cosette; she\nwas not mistaken. She had returned to the Rue de la Chanvrerie herself.\nWhat she did there the reader has just seen. She died with the tragic\njoy of jealous hearts who drag the beloved being into their own death,\nand who say: \"No one shall have him!\"\n\nMarius covered Cosette's letter with kisses. So she loved him! For one\nmoment the idea occurred to him that he ought not to die now. Then\nhe said to himself: \"She is going away. Her father is taking her to\nEngland, and my grandfather refuses his consent to the marriage. Nothing\nis changed in our fates.\" Dreamers like Marius are subject to supreme\nattacks of dejection, and desperate resolves are the result. The fatigue\nof living is insupportable; death is sooner over with. Then he reflected\nthat he had still two duties to fulfil: to inform Cosette of his\ndeath and send her a final farewell, and to save from the impending\ncatastrophe which was in preparation, that poor child, Eponine's brother\nand Thenardier's son.\n\nHe had a pocket-book about him; the same one which had contained\nthe note-book in which he had inscribed so many thoughts of love for\nCosette. He tore out a leaf and wrote on it a few lines in pencil:--\n\n\"Our marriage was impossible. I asked my grandfather, he refused; I have\nno fortune, neither hast thou. I hastened to thee, thou wert no longer\nthere. Thou knowest the promise that I gave thee, I shall keep it. I\ndie. I love thee. When thou readest this, my soul will be near thee, and\nthou wilt smile.\"\n\nHaving nothing wherewith to seal this letter, he contented himself with\nfolding the paper in four, and added the address:--\n\n\"To Mademoiselle Cosette Fauchelevent, at M. Fauchelevent's, Rue de\nl'Homme Arme, No. 7.\"\n\nHaving folded the letter, he stood in thought for a moment, drew out\nhis pocket-book again, opened it, and wrote, with the same pencil, these\nfour lines on the first page:--\n\n\"My name is Marius Pontmercy. Carry my body to my grandfather, M.\nGillenormand, Rue des Filles-du-Calvaire, No. 6, in the Marais.\"\n\nHe put his pocketbook back in his pocket, then he called Gavroche.\n\nThe gamin, at the sound of Marius' voice, ran up to him with his merry\nand devoted air.\n\n\"Will you do something for me?\"\n\n\"Anything,\" said Gavroche. \"Good God! if it had not been for you, I\nshould have been done for.\"\n\n\"Do you see this letter?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Take it. Leave the barricade instantly\" (Gavroche began to scratch his\near uneasily) \"and to-morrow morning, you will deliver it at its address\nto Mademoiselle Cosette, at M. Fauchelevent's, Rue de l'Homme Arme, No.\n7.\"\n\nThe heroic child replied\n\n\"Well, but! in the meanwhile the barricade will be taken, and I shall\nnot be there.\"\n\n\"The barricade will not be attacked until daybreak, according to all\nappearances, and will not be taken before to-morrow noon.\"\n\nThe fresh respite which the assailants were granting to the barricade\nhad, in fact, been prolonged. It was one of those intermissions which\nfrequently occur in nocturnal combats, which are always followed by an\nincrease of rage.\n\n\"Well,\" said Gavroche, \"what if I were to go and carry your letter\nto-morrow?\"\n\n\"It will be too late. The barricade will probably be blockaded, all\nthe streets will be guarded, and you will not be able to get out. Go at\nonce.\"\n\nGavroche could think of no reply to this, and stood there in indecision,\nscratching his ear sadly.\n\nAll at once, he took the letter with one of those birdlike movements\nwhich were common with him.\n\n\"All right,\" said he.\n\nAnd he started off at a run through Mondetour lane.\n\nAn idea had occurred to Gavroche which had brought him to a decision,\nbut he had not mentioned it for fear that Marius might offer some\nobjection to it.\n\nThis was the idea:--\n\n\"It is barely midnight, the Rue de l'Homme Arme is not far off; I will\ngo and deliver the letter at once, and I shall get back in time.\"\n\n\n\n\nBOOK FIFTEENTH.--THE RUE DE L'HOMME ARME\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I--A DRINKER IS A BABBLER\n\nWhat are the convulsions of a city in comparison with the insurrections\nof the soul? Man is a depth still greater than the people. Jean Valjean\nat that very moment was the prey of a terrible upheaval. Every sort of\ngulf had opened again within him. He also was trembling, like Paris,\non the brink of an obscure and formidable revolution. A few hours\nhad sufficed to bring this about. His destiny and his conscience had\nsuddenly been covered with gloom. Of him also, as well as of Paris, it\nmight have been said: \"Two principles are face to face. The white angel\nand the black angel are about to seize each other on the bridge of the\nabyss. Which of the two will hurl the other over? Who will carry the\nday?\"\n\nOn the evening preceding this same 5th of June, Jean Valjean,\naccompanied by Cosette and Toussaint had installed himself in the Rue de\nl'Homme Arme. A change awaited him there.\n\nCosette had not quitted the Rue Plumet without making an effort at\nresistance. For the first time since they had lived side by side,\nCosette's will and the will of Jean Valjean had proved to be distinct,\nand had been in opposition, at least, if they had not clashed. There had\nbeen objections on one side and inflexibility on the other. The abrupt\nadvice: \"Leave your house,\" hurled at Jean Valjean by a stranger, had\nalarmed him to the extent of rendering him peremptory. He thought that\nhe had been traced and followed. Cosette had been obliged to give way.\n\nBoth had arrived in the Rue de l'Homme Arme without opening their lips,\nand without uttering a word, each being absorbed in his own personal\npreoccupation; Jean Valjean so uneasy that he did not notice Cosette's\nsadness, Cosette so sad that she did not notice Jean Valjean's\nuneasiness.\n\nJean Valjean had taken Toussaint with him, a thing which he had never\ndone in his previous absences. He perceived the possibility of not\nreturning to the Rue Plumet, and he could neither leave Toussaint behind\nnor confide his secret to her. Besides, he felt that she was devoted and\ntrustworthy. Treachery between master and servant begins in curiosity.\nNow Toussaint, as though she had been destined to be Jean Valjean's\nservant, was not curious. She stammered in her peasant dialect of\nBarneville: \"I am made so; I do my work; the rest is no affair of mine.\"\n\nIn this departure from the Rue Plumet, which had been almost a flight,\nJean Valjean had carried away nothing but the little embalmed valise,\nbaptized by Cosette \"the inseparable.\" Full trunks would have required\nporters, and porters are witnesses. A fiacre had been summoned to the\ndoor on the Rue de Babylone, and they had taken their departure.\n\nIt was with difficulty that Toussaint had obtained permission to pack up\na little linen and clothes and a few toilet articles. Cosette had taken\nonly her portfolio and her blotting-book.\n\nJean Valjean, with a view to augmenting the solitude and the mystery of\nthis departure, had arranged to quit the pavilion of the Rue Plumet only\nat dusk, which had allowed Cosette time to write her note to Marius.\nThey had arrived in the Rue de l'Homme Arme after night had fully\nfallen.\n\nThey had gone to bed in silence.\n\nThe lodgings in the Rue de l'Homme Arme were situated on a back\ncourt, on the second floor, and were composed of two sleeping-rooms, a\ndining-room and a kitchen adjoining the dining-room, with a garret\nwhere there was a folding-bed, and which fell to Toussaint's share. The\ndining-room was an antechamber as well, and separated the two bedrooms.\nThe apartment was provided with all necessary utensils.\n\nPeople re-acquire confidence as foolishly as they lose it; human nature\nis so constituted. Hardly had Jean Valjean reached the Rue de l'Homme\nArme when his anxiety was lightened and by degrees dissipated. There\nare soothing spots which act in some sort mechanically on the mind.\nAn obscure street, peaceable inhabitants. Jean Valjean experienced an\nindescribable contagion of tranquillity in that alley of ancient Paris,\nwhich is so narrow that it is barred against carriages by a transverse\nbeam placed on two posts, which is deaf and dumb in the midst of the\nclamorous city, dimly lighted at mid-day, and is, so to speak, incapable\nof emotions between two rows of lofty houses centuries old, which hold\ntheir peace like ancients as they are. There was a touch of stagnant\noblivion in that street. Jean Valjean drew his breath once more there.\nHow could he be found there?\n\nHis first care was to place the inseparable beside him.\n\nHe slept well. Night brings wisdom; we may add, night soothes. On the\nfollowing morning he awoke in a mood that was almost gay. He thought the\ndining-room charming, though it was hideous, furnished with an old round\ntable, a long sideboard surmounted by a slanting mirror, a dilapidated\narm-chair, and several plain chairs which were encumbered with\nToussaint's packages. In one of these packages Jean Valjean's uniform of\na National Guard was visible through a rent.\n\nAs for Cosette, she had had Toussaint take some broth to her room, and\ndid not make her appearance until evening.\n\nAbout five o'clock, Toussaint, who was going and coming and busying\nherself with the tiny establishment, set on the table a cold chicken,\nwhich Cosette, out of deference to her father, consented to glance at.\n\nThat done, Cosette, under the pretext of an obstinate sick headache,\nhad bade Jean Valjean good night and had shut herself up in her chamber.\nJean Valjean had eaten a wing of the chicken with a good appetite, and\nwith his elbows on the table, having gradually recovered his serenity,\nhad regained possession of his sense of security.\n\nWhile he was discussing this modest dinner, he had, twice or thrice,\nnoticed in a confused way, Toussaint's stammering words as she said\nto him: \"Monsieur, there is something going on, they are fighting in\nParis.\" But absorbed in a throng of inward calculations, he had paid no\nheed to it. To tell the truth, he had not heard her. He rose and began\nto pace from the door to the window and from the window to the door,\ngrowing ever more serene.\n\nWith this calm, Cosette, his sole anxiety, recurred to his thoughts. Not\nthat he was troubled by this headache, a little nervous crisis, a young\ngirl's fit of sulks, the cloud of a moment, there would be nothing left\nof it in a day or two; but he meditated on the future, and, as was his\nhabit, he thought of it with pleasure. After all, he saw no obstacle to\ntheir happy life resuming its course. At certain hours, everything seems\nimpossible, at others everything appears easy; Jean Valjean was in the\nmidst of one of these good hours. They generally succeed the bad\nones, as day follows night, by virtue of that law of succession and\nof contrast which lies at the very foundation of nature, and which\nsuperficial minds call antithesis. In this peaceful street where he had\ntaken refuge, Jean Valjean got rid of all that had been troubling him\nfor some time past. This very fact, that he had seen many shadows, made\nhim begin to perceive a little azure. To have quitted the Rue\nPlumet without complications or incidents was one good step already\naccomplished. Perhaps it would be wise to go abroad, if only for a few\nmonths, and to set out for London. Well, they would go. What difference\ndid it make to him whether he was in France or in England, provided he\nhad Cosette beside him? Cosette was his nation. Cosette sufficed for\nhis happiness; the idea that he, perhaps, did not suffice for Cosette's\nhappiness, that idea which had formerly been the cause of his fever\nand sleeplessness, did not even present itself to his mind. He was in a\nstate of collapse from all his past sufferings, and he was fully entered\non optimism. Cosette was by his side, she seemed to be his; an optical\nillusion which every one has experienced. He arranged in his own mind,\nwith all sorts of felicitous devices, his departure for England with\nCosette, and he beheld his felicity reconstituted wherever he pleased,\nin the perspective of his revery.\n\nAs he paced to and fro with long strides, his glance suddenly\nencountered something strange.\n\nIn the inclined mirror facing him which surmounted the sideboard, he saw\nthe four lines which follow:--\n\n\"My dearest, alas! my father insists on our setting out immediately. We\nshall be this evening in the Rue de l'Homme Arme, No. 7. In a week we\nshall be in England. COSETTE. June 4th.\"\n\nJean Valjean halted, perfectly haggard.\n\nCosette on her arrival had placed her blotting-book on the sideboard in\nfront of the mirror, and, utterly absorbed in her agony of grief, had\nforgotten it and left it there, without even observing that she had left\nit wide open, and open at precisely the page on which she had laid to\ndry the four lines which she had penned, and which she had given in\ncharge of the young workman in the Rue Plumet. The writing had been\nprinted off on the blotter.\n\nThe mirror reflected the writing.\n\nThe result was, what is called in geometry, the symmetrical image; so\nthat the writing, reversed on the blotter, was righted in the mirror and\npresented its natural appearance; and Jean Valjean had beneath his eyes\nthe letter written by Cosette to Marius on the preceding evening.\n\nIt was simple and withering.\n\nJean Valjean stepped up to the mirror. He read the four lines again, but\nhe did not believe them. They produced on him the effect of appearing in\na flash of lightning. It was a hallucination, it was impossible. It was\nnot so.\n\nLittle by little, his perceptions became more precise; he looked at\nCosette's blotting-book, and the consciousness of the reality returned\nto him. He caught up the blotter and said: \"It comes from there.\"\nHe feverishly examined the four lines imprinted on the blotter, the\nreversal of the letters converted into an odd scrawl, and he saw no\nsense in it. Then he said to himself: \"But this signifies nothing; there\nis nothing written here.\" And he drew a long breath with inexpressible\nrelief. Who has not experienced those foolish joys in horrible instants?\nThe soul does not surrender to despair until it has exhausted all\nillusions.\n\nHe held the blotter in his hand and contemplated it in stupid delight,\nalmost ready to laugh at the hallucination of which he had been the\ndupe. All at once his eyes fell upon the mirror again, and again he\nbeheld the vision. There were the four lines outlined with inexorable\nclearness. This time it was no mirage. The recurrence of a vision is a\nreality; it was palpable, it was the writing restored in the mirror. He\nunderstood.\n\nJean Valjean tottered, dropped the blotter, and fell into the old\narm-chair beside the buffet, with drooping head, and glassy eyes, in\nutter bewilderment. He told himself that it was plain, that the light of\nthe world had been eclipsed forever, and that Cosette had written that\nto some one. Then he heard his soul, which had become terrible once\nmore, give vent to a dull roar in the gloom. Try then the effect of\ntaking from the lion the dog which he has in his cage!\n\nStrange and sad to say, at that very moment, Marius had not yet received\nCosette's letter; chance had treacherously carried it to Jean Valjean\nbefore delivering it to Marius. Up to that day, Jean Valjean had not\nbeen vanquished by trial. He had been subjected to fearful proofs; no\nviolence of bad fortune had been spared him; the ferocity of fate, armed\nwith all vindictiveness and all social scorn, had taken him for her prey\nand had raged against him. He had accepted every extremity when it had\nbeen necessary; he had sacrificed his inviolability as a reformed man,\nhad yielded up his liberty, risked his head, lost everything, suffered\neverything, and he had remained disinterested and stoical to such a\npoint that he might have been thought to be absent from himself like a\nmartyr. His conscience inured to every assault of destiny, might have\nappeared to be forever impregnable. Well, any one who had beheld his\nspiritual self would have been obliged to concede that it weakened at\nthat moment. It was because, of all the tortures which he had undergone\nin the course of this long inquisition to which destiny had doomed him,\nthis was the most terrible. Never had such pincers seized him hitherto.\nHe felt the mysterious stirring of all his latent sensibilities. He felt\nthe plucking at the strange chord. Alas! the supreme trial, let us say\nrather, the only trial, is the loss of the beloved being.\n\nPoor old Jean Valjean certainly did not love Cosette otherwise than as\na father; but we have already remarked, above, that into this paternity\nthe widowhood of his life had introduced all the shades of love; he\nloved Cosette as his daughter, and he loved her as his mother, and he\nloved her as his sister; and, as he had never had either a woman to\nlove or a wife, as nature is a creditor who accepts no protest, that\nsentiment also, the most impossible to lose, was mingled with the\nrest, vague, ignorant, pure with the purity of blindness, unconscious,\ncelestial, angelic, divine; less like a sentiment than like an instinct,\nless like an instinct than like an imperceptible and invisible but real\nattraction; and love, properly speaking, was, in his immense tenderness\nfor Cosette, like the thread of gold in the mountain, concealed and\nvirgin.\n\nLet the reader recall the situation of heart which we have already\nindicated. No marriage was possible between them; not even that of\nsouls; and yet, it is certain that their destinies were wedded. With the\nexception of Cosette, that is to say, with the exception of a childhood,\nJean Valjean had never, in the whole of his long life, known anything of\nthat which may be loved. The passions and loves which succeed each other\nhad not produced in him those successive green growths, tender green or\ndark green, which can be seen in foliage which passes through the winter\nand in men who pass fifty. In short, and we have insisted on it more\nthan once, all this interior fusion, all this whole, of which the sum\ntotal was a lofty virtue, ended in rendering Jean Valjean a father to\nCosette. A strange father, forged from the grandfather, the son, the\nbrother, and the husband, that existed in Jean Valjean; a father in whom\nthere was included even a mother; a father who loved Cosette and adored\nher, and who held that child as his light, his home, his family, his\ncountry, his paradise.\n\nThus when he saw that the end had absolutely come, that she was escaping\nfrom him, that she was slipping from his hands, that she was gliding\nfrom him, like a cloud, like water, when he had before his eyes this\ncrushing proof: \"another is the goal of her heart, another is the wish\nof her life; there is a dearest one, I am no longer anything but her\nfather, I no longer exist\"; when he could no longer doubt, when he\nsaid to himself: \"She is going away from me!\" the grief which he felt\nsurpassed the bounds of possibility. To have done all that he had done\nfor the purpose of ending like this! And the very idea of being nothing!\nThen, as we have just said, a quiver of revolt ran through him from\nhead to foot. He felt, even in the very roots of his hair, the immense\nreawakening of egotism, and the _I_ in this man's abyss howled.\n\nThere is such a thing as the sudden giving way of the inward subsoil. A\ndespairing certainty does not make its way into a man without thrusting\naside and breaking certain profound elements which, in some cases, are\nthe very man himself. Grief, when it attains this shape, is a headlong\nflight of all the forces of the conscience. These are fatal crises. Few\namong us emerge from them still like ourselves and firm in duty. When\nthe limit of endurance is overstepped, the most imperturbable virtue is\ndisconcerted. Jean Valjean took the blotter again, and convinced himself\nafresh; he remained bowed and as though petrified and with staring eyes,\nover those four unobjectionable lines; and there arose within him such\na cloud that one might have thought that everything in this soul was\ncrumbling away.\n\nHe examined this revelation, athwart the exaggerations of revery, with\nan apparent and terrifying calmness, for it is a fearful thing when a\nman's calmness reaches the coldness of the statue.\n\nHe measured the terrible step which his destiny had taken without his\nhaving a suspicion of the fact; he recalled his fears of the preceding\nsummer, so foolishly dissipated; he recognized the precipice, it was\nstill the same; only, Jean Valjean was no longer on the brink, he was at\nthe bottom of it.\n\nThe unprecedented and heart-rending thing about it was that he had\nfallen without perceiving it. All the light of his life had departed,\nwhile he still fancied that he beheld the sun.\n\nHis instinct did not hesitate. He put together certain circumstances,\ncertain dates, certain blushes and certain pallors on Cosette's part,\nand he said to himself: \"It is he.\"\n\nThe divination of despair is a sort of mysterious bow which never misses\nits aim. He struck Marius with his first conjecture. He did not know the\nname, but he found the man instantly. He distinctly perceived, in the\nbackground of the implacable conjuration of his memories, the unknown\nprowler of the Luxembourg, that wretched seeker of love adventures, that\nidler of romance, that idiot, that coward, for it is cowardly to come\nand make eyes at young girls who have beside them a father who loves\nthem.\n\nAfter he had thoroughly verified the fact that this young man was at\nthe bottom of this situation, and that everything proceeded from that\nquarter, he, Jean Valjean, the regenerated man, the man who had so\nlabored over his soul, the man who had made so many efforts to resolve\nall life, all misery, and all unhappiness into love, looked into his own\nbreast and there beheld a spectre, Hate.\n\nGreat griefs contain something of dejection. They discourage one with\nexistence. The man into whom they enter feels something within him\nwithdraw from him. In his youth, their visits are lugubrious; later on\nthey are sinister. Alas, if despair is a fearful thing when the blood is\nhot, when the hair is black, when the head is erect on the body like\nthe flame on the torch, when the roll of destiny still retains its full\nthickness, when the heart, full of desirable love, still possesses beats\nwhich can be returned to it, when one has time for redress, when all\nwomen and all smiles and all the future and all the horizon are before\none, when the force of life is complete, what is it in old age, when\nthe years hasten on, growing ever paler, to that twilight hour when one\nbegins to behold the stars of the tomb?\n\nWhile he was meditating, Toussaint entered. Jean Valjean rose and asked\nher:--\n\n\"In what quarter is it? Do you know?\"\n\nToussaint was struck dumb, and could only answer him:--\n\n\"What is it, sir?\"\n\nJean Valjean began again: \"Did you not tell me that just now that there\nis fighting going on?\"\n\n\"Ah! yes, sir,\" replied Toussaint. \"It is in the direction of\nSaint-Merry.\"\n\nThere is a mechanical movement which comes to us, unconsciously, from\nthe most profound depths of our thought. It was, no doubt, under\nthe impulse of a movement of this sort, and of which he was hardly\nconscious, that Jean Valjean, five minutes later, found himself in the\nstreet.\n\nBareheaded, he sat upon the stone post at the door of his house. He\nseemed to be listening.\n\nNight had come.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II--THE STREET URCHIN AN ENEMY OF LIGHT\n\nHow long did he remain thus? What was the ebb and flow of this tragic\nmeditation? Did he straighten up? Did he remain bowed? Had he been\nbent to breaking? Could he still rise and regain his footing in his\nconscience upon something solid? He probably would not have been able to\ntell himself.\n\nThe street was deserted. A few uneasy bourgeois, who were rapidly\nreturning home, hardly saw him. Each one for himself in times of peril.\nThe lamp-lighter came as usual to light the lantern which was situated\nprecisely opposite the door of No. 7, and then went away. Jean Valjean\nwould not have appeared like a living man to any one who had examined\nhim in that shadow. He sat there on the post of his door, motionless as\na form of ice. There is congealment in despair. The alarm bells and\na vague and stormy uproar were audible. In the midst of all these\nconvulsions of the bell mingled with the revolt, the clock of Saint-Paul\nstruck eleven, gravely and without haste; for the tocsin is man; the\nhour is God. The passage of the hour produced no effect on Jean Valjean;\nJean Valjean did not stir. Still, at about that moment, a brusque report\nburst forth in the direction of the Halles, a second yet more violent\nfollowed; it was probably that attack on the barricade in the Rue de la\nChanvrerie which we have just seen repulsed by Marius. At this double\ndischarge, whose fury seemed augmented by the stupor of the night, Jean\nValjean started; he rose, turning towards the quarter whence the noise\nproceeded; then he fell back upon the post again, folded his arms, and\nhis head slowly sank on his bosom again.\n\nHe resumed his gloomy dialogue with himself.\n\nAll at once, he raised his eyes; some one was walking in the street, he\nheard steps near him. He looked, and by the light of the lanterns, in\nthe direction of the street which ran into the Rue-aux-Archives, he\nperceived a young, livid, and beaming face.\n\nGavroche had just arrived in the Rue l'Homme Arme.\n\nGavroche was staring into the air, apparently in search of something. He\nsaw Jean Valjean perfectly well but he took no notice of him.\n\nGavroche after staring into the air, stared below; he raised himself on\ntiptoe, and felt of the doors and windows of the ground floor; they were\nall shut, bolted, and padlocked. After having authenticated the fronts\nof five or six barricaded houses in this manner, the urchin shrugged his\nshoulders, and took himself to task in these terms:--\n\n\"Pardi!\"\n\nThen he began to stare into the air again.\n\nJean Valjean, who, an instant previously, in his then state of mind,\nwould not have spoken to or even answered any one, felt irresistibly\nimpelled to accost that child.\n\n\"What is the matter with you, my little fellow?\" he said.\n\n\"The matter with me is that I am hungry,\" replied Gavroche frankly. And\nhe added: \"Little fellow yourself.\"\n\nJean Valjean fumbled in his fob and pulled out a five-franc piece.\n\nBut Gavroche, who was of the wagtail species, and who skipped\nvivaciously from one gesture to another, had just picked up a stone. He\nhad caught sight of the lantern.\n\n\"See here,\" said he, \"you still have your lanterns here. You are\ndisobeying the regulations, my friend. This is disorderly. Smash that\nfor me.\"\n\nAnd he flung the stone at the lantern, whose broken glass fell with\nsuch a clatter that the bourgeois in hiding behind their curtains in the\nopposite house cried: \"There is 'Ninety-three' come again.\"\n\nThe lantern oscillated violently, and went out. The street had suddenly\nbecome black.\n\n\"That's right, old street,\" ejaculated Gavroche, \"put on your\nnight-cap.\"\n\nAnd turning to Jean Valjean:--\n\n\"What do you call that gigantic monument that you have there at the end\nof the street? It's the Archives, isn't it? I must crumble up those big\nstupids of pillars a bit and make a nice barricade out of them.\"\n\nJean Valjean stepped up to Gavroche.\n\n\"Poor creature,\" he said in a low tone, and speaking to himself, \"he is\nhungry.\"\n\nAnd he laid the hundred-sou piece in his hand.\n\nGavroche raised his face, astonished at the size of this sou; he stared\nat it in the darkness, and the whiteness of the big sou dazzled him.\nHe knew five-franc pieces by hearsay; their reputation was agreeable to\nhim; he was delighted to see one close to. He said:--\n\n\"Let us contemplate the tiger.\"\n\nHe gazed at it for several minutes in ecstasy; then, turning to Jean\nValjean, he held out the coin to him, and said majestically to him:--\n\n\"Bourgeois, I prefer to smash lanterns. Take back your ferocious beast.\nYou can't bribe me. That has got five claws; but it doesn't scratch me.\"\n\n\"Have you a mother?\" asked Jean Valjean.\n\nGavroche replied:--\n\n\"More than you have, perhaps.\"\n\n\"Well,\" returned Jean Valjean, \"keep the money for your mother!\"\n\nGavroche was touched. Moreover, he had just noticed that the man who was\naddressing him had no hat, and this inspired him with confidence.\n\n\"Truly,\" said he, \"so it wasn't to keep me from breaking the lanterns?\"\n\n\"Break whatever you please.\"\n\n\"You're a fine man,\" said Gavroche.\n\nAnd he put the five-franc piece into one of his pockets.\n\nHis confidence having increased, he added:--\n\n\"Do you belong in this street?\"\n\n\"Yes, why?\"\n\n\"Can you tell me where No. 7 is?\"\n\n\"What do you want with No. 7?\"\n\nHere the child paused, he feared that he had said too much; he thrust\nhis nails energetically into his hair and contented himself with\nreplying:--\n\n\"Ah! Here it is.\"\n\nAn idea flashed through Jean Valjean's mind. Anguish does have these\ngleams. He said to the lad:--\n\n\"Are you the person who is bringing a letter that I am expecting?\"\n\n\"You?\" said Gavroche. \"You are not a woman.\"\n\n\"The letter is for Mademoiselle Cosette, is it not?\"\n\n\"Cosette,\" muttered Gavroche. \"Yes, I believe that is the queer name.\"\n\n\"Well,\" resumed Jean Valjean, \"I am the person to whom you are to\ndeliver the letter. Give it here.\"\n\n\"In that case, you must know that I was sent from the barricade.\"\n\n\"Of course,\" said Jean Valjean.\n\nGavroche engulfed his hand in another of his pockets and drew out a\npaper folded in four.\n\nThen he made the military salute.\n\n\"Respect for despatches,\" said he. \"It comes from the Provisional\nGovernment.\"\n\n\"Give it to me,\" said Jean Valjean.\n\nGavroche held the paper elevated above his head.\n\n\"Don't go and fancy it's a love letter. It is for a woman, but it's for\nthe people. We men fight and we respect the fair sex. We are not as\nthey are in fine society, where there are lions who send chickens[55] to\ncamels.\"\n\n\"Give it to me.\"\n\n\"After all,\" continued Gavroche, \"you have the air of an honest man.\"\n\n\"Give it to me quick.\"\n\n\"Catch hold of it.\"\n\nAnd he handed the paper to Jean Valjean.\n\n\"And make haste, Monsieur What's-your-name, for Mamselle Cosette is\nwaiting.\"\n\nGavroche was satisfied with himself for having produced this remark.\n\nJean Valjean began again:--\n\n\"Is it to Saint-Merry that the answer is to be sent?\"\n\n\"There you are making some of those bits of pastry vulgarly called\nbrioches [blunders]. This letter comes from the barricade of the Rue de\nla Chanvrerie, and I'm going back there. Good evening, citizen.\"\n\nThat said, Gavroche took himself off, or, to describe it more exactly,\nfluttered away in the direction whence he had come with a flight like\nthat of an escaped bird. He plunged back into the gloom as though he\nmade a hole in it, with the rigid rapidity of a projectile; the alley of\nl'Homme Arme became silent and solitary once more; in a twinkling, that\nstrange child, who had about him something of the shadow and of the\ndream, had buried himself in the mists of the rows of black houses, and\nwas lost there, like smoke in the dark; and one might have thought that\nhe had dissipated and vanished, had there not taken place, a few minutes\nafter his disappearance, a startling shiver of glass, and had not the\nmagnificent crash of a lantern rattling down on the pavement once more\nabruptly awakened the indignant bourgeois. It was Gavroche upon his way\nthrough the Rue du Chaume.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III--WHILE COSETTE AND TOUSSAINT ARE ASLEEP\n\nJean Valjean went into the house with Marius' letter.\n\nHe groped his way up the stairs, as pleased with the darkness as an owl\nwho grips his prey, opened and shut his door softly, listened to see\nwhether he could hear any noise,--made sure that, to all appearances,\nCosette and Toussaint were asleep, and plunged three or four matches\ninto the bottle of the Fumade lighter before he could evoke a spark, so\ngreatly did his hand tremble. What he had just done smacked of theft. At\nlast the candle was lighted; he leaned his elbows on the table, unfolded\nthe paper, and read.\n\nIn violent emotions, one does not read, one flings to the earth, so to\nspeak, the paper which one holds, one clutches it like a victim, one\ncrushes it, one digs into it the nails of one's wrath, or of one's joy;\none hastens to the end, one leaps to the beginning; attention is at\nfever heat; it takes up in the gross, as it were, the essential points;\nit seizes on one point, and the rest disappears. In Marius' note to\nCosette, Jean Valjean saw only these words:--\n\n\"I die. When thou readest this, my soul will be near thee.\"\n\nIn the presence of these two lines, he was horribly dazzled; he remained\nfor a moment, crushed, as it were, by the change of emotion which\nwas taking place within him, he stared at Marius' note with a sort of\nintoxicated amazement, he had before his eyes that splendor, the death\nof a hated individual.\n\nHe uttered a frightful cry of inward joy. So it was all over. The\ncatastrophe had arrived sooner than he had dared to hope. The being who\nobstructed his destiny was disappearing. That man had taken himself off\nof his own accord, freely, willingly. This man was going to his death,\nand he, Jean Valjean, had had no hand in the matter, and it was through\nno fault of his. Perhaps, even, he is already dead. Here his fever\nentered into calculations. No, he is not dead yet. The letter had\nevidently been intended for Cosette to read on the following morning;\nafter the two discharges that were heard between eleven o'clock and\nmidnight, nothing more has taken place; the barricade will not be\nattacked seriously until daybreak; but that makes no difference, from\nthe moment when \"that man\" is concerned in this war, he is lost; he is\ncaught in the gearing. Jean Valjean felt himself delivered. So he was\nabout to find himself alone with Cosette once more. The rivalry would\ncease; the future was beginning again. He had but to keep this note in\nhis pocket. Cosette would never know what had become of that man. All\nthat there requires to be done is to let things take their own course.\nThis man cannot escape. If he is not already dead, it is certain that he\nis about to die. What good fortune!\n\nHaving said all this to himself, he became gloomy.\n\nThen he went down stairs and woke up the porter.\n\nAbout an hour later, Jean Valjean went out in the complete costume of\na National Guard, and with his arms. The porter had easily found in the\nneighborhood the wherewithal to complete his equipment. He had a loaded\ngun and a cartridge-box filled with cartridges.\n\nHe strode off in the direction of the markets.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV--GAVROCHE'S EXCESS OF ZEAL\n\nIn the meantime, Gavroche had had an adventure.\n\nGavroche, after having conscientiously stoned the lantern in the Rue du\nChaume, entered the Rue des Vielles-Haudriettes, and not seeing \"even a\ncat\" there, he thought the opportunity a good one to strike up all the\nsong of which he was capable. His march, far from being retarded by his\nsinging, was accelerated by it. He began to sow along the sleeping or\nterrified houses these incendiary couplets:--\n\n               \"L'oiseau medit dans les charmilles,\n               Et pretend qu'hier Atala\n               Avec un Russe s'en alla.\n                    Ou vont les belles filles,\n                         Lon la.\n\n               \"Mon ami Pierrot, tu babilles,\n               Parce que l'autre jour Mila\n               Cogna sa vitre et m'appela,\n                    Ou vont les belles filles,\n                         Lon la.\n\n               \"Les drolesses sont fort gentilles,\n               Leur poison qui m'ensorcela\n               Griserait Monsieur Orfila.\n                    Ou vont les belles filles,\n                         Lon la.\n\n               \"J'aime l'amour et les bisbilles,\n               J'aime Agnes, j'aime Pamela,\n               Lisa en m'allumant se brula.\n                    Ou vont les belles filles,\n                         Lon la.\n\n               \"Jadis, quand je vis les mantilles\n               De Suzette et de Zeila,\n               Mon ame aleurs plis se mela,\n                    Ou vont les belles filles,\n                         Lon la.\n\n               \"Amour, quand dans l'ombre ou tu brilles,\n                Tu coiffes de roses Lola,\n               Je me damnerais pour cela.\n                    Ou vont les belles filles,\n                         Lon la.\n\n               \"Jeanne a ton miroir tu t'habilles!\n               Mon coeur un beau jour s'envola.\n               Je crois que c'est Jeanne qui l'a.\n                    Ou vont les belles filles,\n                         Lon la.\n\n               \"Le soir, en sortant des quadrilles,\n               Je montre aux etoiles Stella,\n               Et je leur dis: 'Regardez-la.'\n                    Ou vont les belles filles,\n                         Lon la.\"[56]\n\nGavroche, as he sang, was lavish of his pantomime. Gesture is the strong\npoint of the refrain. His face, an inexhaustible repertory of masks,\nproduced grimaces more convulsing and more fantastic than the rents of a\ncloth torn in a high gale. Unfortunately, as he was alone, and as it was\nnight, this was neither seen nor even visible. Such wastes of riches do\noccur.\n\nAll at once, he stopped short.\n\n\"Let us interrupt the romance,\" said he.\n\nHis feline eye had just descried, in the recess of a carriage door,\nwhat is called in painting, an ensemble, that is to say, a person and\na thing; the thing was a hand-cart, the person was a man from Auvergene\nwho was sleeping therein.\n\nThe shafts of the cart rested on the pavement, and the Auvergnat's head\nwas supported against the front of the cart. His body was coiled up on\nthis inclined plane and his feet touched the ground.\n\nGavroche, with his experience of the things of this world, recognized\na drunken man. He was some corner errand-man who had drunk too much and\nwas sleeping too much.\n\n\"There now,\" thought Gavroche, \"that's what the summer nights are good\nfor. We'll take the cart for the Republic, and leave the Auvergnat for\nthe Monarchy.\"\n\nHis mind had just been illuminated by this flash of light:--\n\n\"How bully that cart would look on our barricade!\"\n\nThe Auvergnat was snoring.\n\nGavroche gently tugged at the cart from behind, and at the Auvergnat\nfrom the front, that is to say, by the feet, and at the expiration of\nanother minute the imperturbable Auvergnat was reposing flat on the\npavement.\n\nThe cart was free.\n\nGavroche, habituated to facing the unexpected in all quarters, had\neverything about him. He fumbled in one of his pockets, and pulled from\nit a scrap of paper and a bit of red pencil filched from some carpenter.\n\nHe wrote:--\n\n                         \"French Republic.\"\n\n    \"Received thy cart.\"\n\n    And he signed it:  \"GAVROCHE.\"\n\nThat done, he put the paper in the pocket of the still snoring\nAuvergnat's velvet vest, seized the cart shafts in both hands, and set\noff in the direction of the Halles, pushing the cart before him at a\nhard gallop with a glorious and triumphant uproar.\n\nThis was perilous. There was a post at the Royal Printing Establishment.\nGavroche did not think of this. This post was occupied by the National\nGuards of the suburbs. The squad began to wake up, and heads were raised\nfrom camp beds. Two street lanterns broken in succession, that ditty\nsung at the top of the lungs. This was a great deal for those cowardly\nstreets, which desire to go to sleep at sunset, and which put the\nextinguisher on their candles at such an early hour. For the last hour,\nthat boy had been creating an uproar in that peaceable arrondissement,\nthe uproar of a fly in a bottle. The sergeant of the banlieue lent an\near. He waited. He was a prudent man.\n\nThe mad rattle of the cart, filled to overflowing the possible measure\nof waiting, and decided the sergeant to make a reconnaisance.\n\n\"There's a whole band of them there!\" said he, \"let us proceed gently.\"\n\nIt was clear that the hydra of anarchy had emerged from its box and that\nit was stalking abroad through the quarter.\n\nAnd the sergeant ventured out of the post with cautious tread.\n\nAll at once, Gavroche, pushing his cart in front of him, and at the very\nmoment when he was about to turn into the Rue des Vielles-Haudriettes,\nfound himself face to face with a uniform, a shako, a plume, and a gun.\n\nFor the second time, he stopped short.\n\n\"Hullo,\" said he, \"it's him. Good day, public order.\"\n\nGavroche's amazement was always brief and speedily thawed.\n\n\"Where are you going, you rascal?\" shouted the sergeant.\n\n\"Citizen,\" retorted Gavroche, \"I haven't called you 'bourgeois' yet. Why\ndo you insult me?\"\n\n\"Where are you going, you rogue?\"\n\n\"Monsieur,\" retorted Gavroche, \"perhaps you were a man of wit yesterday,\nbut you have degenerated this morning.\"\n\n\"I ask you where are you going, you villain?\"\n\nGavroche replied:--\n\n\"You speak prettily. Really, no one would suppose you as old as you are.\nYou ought to sell all your hair at a hundred francs apiece. That would\nyield you five hundred francs.\"\n\n\"Where are you going? Where are you going? Where are you going, bandit?\"\n\nGavroche retorted again:--\n\n\"What villainous words! You must wipe your mouth better the first time\nthat they give you suck.\"\n\nThe sergeant lowered his bayonet.\n\n\"Will you tell me where you are going, you wretch?\"\n\n\"General,\" said Gavroche \"I'm on my way to look for a doctor for my wife\nwho is in labor.\"\n\n\"To arms!\" shouted the sergeant.\n\nThe master-stroke of strong men consists in saving themselves by the\nvery means that have ruined them; Gavroche took in the whole situation\nat a glance. It was the cart which had told against him, it was the\ncart's place to protect him.\n\nAt the moment when the sergeant was on the point of making his descent\non Gavroche, the cart, converted into a projectile and launched with all\nthe latter's might, rolled down upon him furiously, and the sergeant,\nstruck full in the stomach, tumbled over backwards into the gutter while\nhis gun went off in the air.\n\nThe men of the post had rushed out pell-mell at the sergeant's shout;\nthe shot brought on a general random discharge, after which they\nreloaded their weapons and began again.\n\nThis blind-man's-buff musketry lasted for a quarter of an hour and\nkilled several panes of glass.\n\nIn the meanwhile, Gavroche, who had retraced his steps at full speed,\nhalted five or six streets distant and seated himself, panting, on the\nstone post which forms the corner of the Enfants-Rouges.\n\nHe listened.\n\nAfter panting for a few minutes, he turned in the direction where the\nfusillade was raging, lifted his left hand to a level with his nose and\nthrust it forward three times, as he slapped the back of his head with\nhis right hand; an imperious gesture in which Parisian street-urchindom\nhas condensed French irony, and which is evidently efficacious, since it\nhas already lasted half a century.\n\nThis gayety was troubled by one bitter reflection.\n\n\"Yes,\" said he, \"I'm splitting with laughter, I'm twisting with\ndelight, I abound in joy, but I'm losing my way, I shall have to take a\nroundabout way. If I only reach the barricade in season!\"\n\nThereupon he set out again on a run.\n\nAnd as he ran:--\n\n\"Ah, by the way, where was I?\" said he.\n\nAnd he resumed his ditty, as he plunged rapidly through the streets, and\nthis is what died away in the gloom:--\n\n               \"Mais il reste encore des bastilles,\n               Et je vais mettre le hola\n               Dans l'orde public que voila.\n                    Ou vont les belles filles,\n                         Lon la.\n\n               \"Quelqu'un veut-il jouer aux quilles?\n               Tout l'ancien monde s'ecroula\n               Quand la grosse boule roula.\n                    Ou vont les belles filles,\n                         Lon la.\n\n               \"Vieux bon peuple, a coups de bequilles,\n               Cassons ce Louvre ou s'etala\n               La monarchie en falbala.\n                    Ou vont les belles filles,\n                         Lon la.\n\n               \"Nous en avons force les grilles,\n               Le roi Charles-Dix ce jour la,\n               Tenait mal et se decolla.\n                    Ou vont les belles filles,\n                         Lon la.\"[57]\n\nThe post's recourse to arms was not without result. The cart was\nconquered, the drunken man was taken prisoner. The first was put in the\npound, the second was later on somewhat harassed before the councils\nof war as an accomplice. The public ministry of the day proved its\nindefatigable zeal in the defence of society, in this instance.\n\nGavroche's adventure, which has lingered as a tradition in the quarters\nof the Temple, is one of the most terrible souvenirs of the elderly\nbourgeois of the Marais, and is entitled in their memories: \"The\nnocturnal attack by the post of the Royal Printing Establishment.\"\n\n\n[THE END OF VOLUME IV. \"SAINT DENIS\"]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVOLUME V--JEAN VALJEAN\n\n[Illustration: Frontispiece Volume Five ]\n\n[Illustration: Titlepage Volume Five ]\n\n\n\n\nBOOK FIRST.--THE WAR BETWEEN FOUR WALLS\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I--THE CHARYBDIS OF THE FAUBOURG SAINT ANTOINE AND THE SCYLLA OF\nTHE FAUBOURG DU TEMPLE\n\nThe two most memorable barricades which the observer of social maladies\ncan name do not belong to the period in which the action of this work\nis laid. These two barricades, both of them symbols, under two different\naspects, of a redoubtable situation, sprang from the earth at the time\nof the fatal insurrection of June, 1848, the greatest war of the streets\nthat history has ever beheld.\n\nIt sometimes happens that, even contrary to principles, even contrary to\nliberty, equality, and fraternity, even contrary to the universal vote,\neven contrary to the government, by all for all, from the depths of its\nanguish, of its discouragements and its destitutions, of its fevers, of\nits distresses, of its miasmas, of its ignorances, of its darkness, that\ngreat and despairing body, the rabble, protests against, and that the\npopulace wages battle against, the people.\n\nBeggars attack the common right; the ochlocracy rises against demos.\n\nThese are melancholy days; for there is always a certain amount of night\neven in this madness, there is suicide in this duel, and those words\nwhich are intended to be insults--beggars, canaille, ochlocracy,\npopulace--exhibit, alas! rather the fault of those who reign than the\nfault of those who suffer; rather the fault of the privileged than the\nfault of the disinherited.\n\nFor our own part, we never pronounce those words without pain and\nwithout respect, for when philosophy fathoms the facts to which they\ncorrespond, it often finds many a grandeur beside these miseries. Athens\nwas an ochlocracy; the beggars were the making of Holland; the populace\nsaved Rome more than once; and the rabble followed Jesus Christ.\n\nThere is no thinker who has not at times contemplated the magnificences\nof the lower classes.\n\nIt was of this rabble that Saint Jerome was thinking, no doubt, and of\nall these poor people and all these vagabonds and all these miserable\npeople whence sprang the apostles and the martyrs, when he uttered this\nmysterious saying: \"Fex urbis, lex orbis,\"--the dregs of the city, the\nlaw of the earth.\n\nThe exasperations of this crowd which suffers and bleeds, its violences\ncontrary to all sense, directed against the principles which are its\nlife, its masterful deeds against the right, are its popular coups\nd'etat and should be repressed. The man of probity sacrifices himself,\nand out of his very love for this crowd, he combats it. But how\nexcusable he feels it even while holding out against it! How he\nvenerates it even while resisting it! This is one of those rare moments\nwhen, while doing that which it is one's duty to do, one feels something\nwhich disconcerts one, and which would dissuade one from proceeding\nfurther; one persists, it is necessary, but conscience, though\nsatisfied, is sad, and the accomplishment of duty is complicated with a\npain at the heart.\n\nJune, 1848, let us hasten to say, was an exceptional fact, and almost\nimpossible of classification, in the philosophy of history. All the\nwords which we have just uttered, must be discarded, when it becomes\na question of this extraordinary revolt, in which one feels the holy\nanxiety of toil claiming its rights. It was necessary to combat it, and\nthis was a duty, for it attacked the republic. But what was June, 1848,\nat bottom? A revolt of the people against itself.\n\nWhere the subject is not lost sight of, there is no digression; may we,\nthen, be permitted to arrest the reader's attention for a moment on the\ntwo absolutely unique barricades of which we have just spoken and which\ncharacterized this insurrection.\n\nOne blocked the entrance to the Faubourg Saint Antoine; the other\ndefended the approach to the Faubourg du Temple; those before whom these\ntwo fearful masterpieces of civil war reared themselves beneath the\nbrilliant blue sky of June, will never forget them.\n\nThe Saint-Antoine barricade was tremendous; it was three stories high,\nand seven hundred feet wide. It barred the vast opening of the faubourg,\nthat is to say, three streets, from angle to angle; ravined, jagged,\ncut up, divided, crenelated, with an immense rent, buttressed with piles\nthat were bastions in themselves throwing out capes here and there,\npowerfully backed up by two great promontories of houses of the\nfaubourg, it reared itself like a cyclopean dike at the end of the\nformidable place which had seen the 14th of July. Nineteen barricades\nwere ranged, one behind the other, in the depths of the streets\nbehind this principal barricade. At the very sight of it, one felt the\nagonizing suffering in the immense faubourg, which had reached that\npoint of extremity when a distress may become a catastrophe. Of what was\nthat barricade made? Of the ruins of three six-story houses demolished\nexpressly, said some. Of the prodigy of all wraths, said others. It wore\nthe lamentable aspect of all constructions of hatred, ruin. It might be\nasked: Who built this? It might also be said: Who destroyed this? It was\nthe improvisation of the ebullition. Hold! take this door! this grating!\nthis penthouse! this chimney-piece! this broken brazier! this cracked\npot! Give all! cast away all! Push this roll, dig, dismantle, overturn,\nruin everything! It was the collaboration of the pavement, the block of\nstone, the beam, the bar of iron, the rag, the scrap, the broken pane,\nthe unseated chair, the cabbage-stalk, the tatter, the rag, and the\nmalediction. It was grand and it was petty. It was the abyss parodied\non the public place by hubbub. The mass beside the atom; the strip of\nruined wall and the broken bowl,--threatening fraternization of\nevery sort of rubbish. Sisyphus had thrown his rock there and Job his\npotsherd. Terrible, in short. It was the acropolis of the barefooted.\nOverturned carts broke the uniformity of the slope; an immense dray was\nspread out there crossways, its axle pointing heavenward, and seemed a\nscar on that tumultuous facade; an omnibus hoisted gayly, by main force,\nto the very summit of the heap, as though the architects of this bit of\nsavagery had wished to add a touch of the street urchin humor to their\nterror, presented its horseless, unharnessed pole to no one knows what\nhorses of the air. This gigantic heap, the alluvium of the revolt,\nfigured to the mind an Ossa on Pelion of all revolutions; '93 on '89,\nthe 9th of Thermidor on the 10th of August, the 18th of Brumaire on the\n11th of January, Vendemiaire on Prairial, 1848 on 1830. The situation\ndeserved the trouble and this barricade was worthy to figure on the very\nspot whence the Bastille had disappeared. If the ocean made dikes, it\nis thus that it would build. The fury of the flood was stamped upon this\nshapeless mass. What flood? The crowd. One thought one beheld hubbub\npetrified. One thought one heard humming above this barricade as though\nthere had been over their hive, enormous, dark bees of violent progress.\nWas it a thicket? Was it a bacchanalia? Was it a fortress? Vertigo\nseemed to have constructed it with blows of its wings. There was\nsomething of the cess-pool in that redoubt and something Olympian in\nthat confusion. One there beheld in a pell-mell full of despair, the\nrafters of roofs, bits of garret windows with their figured paper,\nwindow sashes with their glass planted there in the ruins awaiting\nthe cannon, wrecks of chimneys, cupboards, tables, benches, howling\ntopsyturveydom, and those thousand poverty-stricken things, the very\nrefuse of the mendicant, which contain at the same time fury and\nnothingness. One would have said that it was the tatters of a people,\nrags of wood, of iron, of bronze, of stone, and that the Faubourg Saint\nAntoine had thrust it there at its door, with a colossal flourish of the\nbroom making of its misery its barricade. Blocks resembling headsman's\nblocks, dislocated chains, pieces of woodwork with brackets having\nthe form of gibbets, horizontal wheels projecting from the rubbish,\namalgamated with this edifice of anarchy the sombre figure of the old\ntortures endured by the people. The barricade Saint Antoine converted\neverything into a weapon; everything that civil war could throw at the\nhead of society proceeded thence; it was not combat, it was a paroxysm;\nthe carbines which defended this redoubt, among which there were some\nblunderbusses, sent bits of earthenware bones, coat-buttons, even the\ncasters from night-stands, dangerous projectiles on account of\nthe brass. This barricade was furious; it hurled to the clouds an\ninexpressible clamor; at certain moments, when provoking the army, it\nwas covered with throngs and tempest; a tumultuous crowd of flaming\nheads crowned it; a swarm filled it; it had a thorny crest of guns, of\nsabres, of cudgels, of axes, of pikes and of bayonets; a vast red flag\nflapped in the wind; shouts of command, songs of attack, the roll of\ndrums, the sobs of women and bursts of gloomy laughter from the starving\nwere to be heard there. It was huge and living, and, like the back of an\nelectric beast, there proceeded from it little flashes of lightning. The\nspirit of revolution covered with its cloud this summit where rumbled\nthat voice of the people which resembles the voice of God; a strange\nmajesty was emitted by this titanic basket of rubbish. It was a heap of\nfilth and it was Sinai.\n\nAs we have said previously, it attacked in the name of the\nrevolution--what? The revolution. It--that barricade, chance, hazard,\ndisorder, terror, misunderstanding, the unknown--had facing it the\nConstituent Assembly, the sovereignty of the people, universal suffrage,\nthe nation, the republic; and it was the Carmagnole bidding defiance to\nthe Marseillaise.\n\nImmense but heroic defiance, for the old faubourg is a hero.\n\nThe faubourg and its redoubt lent each other assistance. The faubourg\nshouldered the redoubt, the redoubt took its stand under cover of the\nfaubourg. The vast barricade spread out like a cliff against which\nthe strategy of the African generals dashed itself. Its caverns, its\nexcrescences, its warts, its gibbosities, grimaced, so to speak, and\ngrinned beneath the smoke. The mitraille vanished in shapelessness; the\nbombs plunged into it; bullets only succeeded in making holes in it;\nwhat was the use of cannonading chaos? and the regiments, accustomed to\nthe fiercest visions of war, gazed with uneasy eyes on that species of\nredoubt, a wild beast in its boar-like bristling and a mountain by its\nenormous size.\n\nA quarter of a league away, from the corner of the Rue du Temple which\ndebouches on the boulevard near the Chateaud'Eau, if one thrust one's\nhead bodily beyond the point formed by the front of the Dallemagne shop,\none perceived in the distance, beyond the canal, in the street which\nmounts the slopes of Belleville at the culminating point of the rise, a\nstrange wall reaching to the second story of the house fronts, a sort\nof hyphen between the houses on the right and the houses on the left, as\nthough the street had folded back on itself its loftiest wall in order\nto close itself abruptly. This wall was built of paving-stones. It was\nstraight, correct, cold, perpendicular, levelled with the square, laid\nout by rule and line. Cement was lacking, of course, but, as in the case\nof certain Roman walls, without interfering with its rigid architecture.\nThe entablature was mathematically parallel with the base. From distance\nto distance, one could distinguish on the gray surface, almost invisible\nloopholes which resembled black threads. These loopholes were separated\nfrom each other by equal spaces. The street was deserted as far as the\neye could reach. All windows and doors were closed. In the background\nrose this barrier, which made a blind thoroughfare of the street, a\nmotionless and tranquil wall; no one was visible, nothing was audible;\nnot a cry, not a sound, not a breath. A sepulchre.\n\nThe dazzling sun of June inundated this terrible thing with light.\n\nIt was the barricade of the Faubourg of the Temple.\n\nAs soon as one arrived on the spot, and caught sight of it, it was\nimpossible, even for the boldest, not to become thoughtful before\nthis mysterious apparition. It was adjusted, jointed, imbricated,\nrectilinear, symmetrical and funereal. Science and gloom met there. One\nfelt that the chief of this barricade was a geometrician or a spectre.\nOne looked at it and spoke low.\n\nFrom time to time, if some soldier, an officer or representative of the\npeople, chanced to traverse the deserted highway, a faint, sharp whistle\nwas heard, and the passer-by fell dead or wounded, or, if he escaped the\nbullet, sometimes a biscaien was seen to ensconce itself in some closed\nshutter, in the interstice between two blocks of stone, or in the\nplaster of a wall. For the men in the barricade had made themselves two\nsmall cannons out of two cast-iron lengths of gas-pipe, plugged up at\none end with tow and fire-clay. There was no waste of useless powder.\nNearly every shot told. There were corpses here and there, and pools of\nblood on the pavement. I remember a white butterfly which went and came\nin the street. Summer does not abdicate.\n\nIn the neighborhood, the spaces beneath the portes cocheres were\nencumbered with wounded.\n\nOne felt oneself aimed at by some person whom one did not see, and one\nunderstood that guns were levelled at the whole length of the street.\n\nMassed behind the sort of sloping ridge which the vaulted canal forms\nat the entrance to the Faubourg du Temple, the soldiers of the attacking\ncolumn, gravely and thoughtfully, watched this dismal redoubt, this\nimmobility, this passivity, whence sprang death. Some crawled flat on\ntheir faces as far as the crest of the curve of the bridge, taking care\nthat their shakos did not project beyond it.\n\nThe valiant Colonel Monteynard admired this barricade with a\nshudder.--\"How that is built!\" he said to a Representative. \"Not one\npaving-stone projects beyond its neighbor. It is made of porcelain.\"--At\nthat moment, a bullet broke the cross on his breast, and he fell.\n\n\"The cowards!\" people said. \"Let them show themselves. Let us see them!\nThey dare not! They are hiding!\"\n\nThe barricade of the Faubourg du Temple, defended by eighty men,\nattacked by ten thousand, held out for three days. On the fourth, they\ndid as at Zaatcha, as at Constantine, they pierced the houses, they came\nover the roofs, the barricade was taken. Not one of the eighty cowards\nthought of flight, all were killed there with the exception of the\nleader, Barthelemy, of whom we shall speak presently.\n\nThe Saint-Antoine barricade was the tumult of thunders; the barricade\nof the Temple was silence. The difference between these two redoubts\nwas the difference between the formidable and the sinister. One seemed a\nmaw; the other a mask.\n\nAdmitting that the gigantic and gloomy insurrection of June was composed\nof a wrath and of an enigma, one divined in the first barricade the\ndragon, and behind the second the sphinx.\n\nThese two fortresses had been erected by two men named, the one,\nCournet, the other, Barthelemy. Cournet made the Saint-Antoine\nbarricade; Barthelemy the barricade of the Temple. Each was the image of\nthe man who had built it.\n\nCournet was a man of lofty stature; he had broad shoulders, a red face,\na crushing fist, a bold heart, a loyal soul, a sincere and terrible eye.\nIntrepid, energetic, irascible, stormy; the most cordial of men, the\nmost formidable of combatants. War, strife, conflict, were the very air\nhe breathed and put him in a good humor. He had been an officer in the\nnavy, and, from his gestures and his voice, one divined that he sprang\nfrom the ocean, and that he came from the tempest; he carried the\nhurricane on into battle. With the exception of the genius, there was\nin Cournet something of Danton, as, with the exception of the divinity,\nthere was in Danton something of Hercules.\n\nBarthelemy, thin, feeble, pale, taciturn, was a sort of tragic street\nurchin, who, having had his ears boxed by a policeman, lay in wait for\nhim, and killed him, and at seventeen was sent to the galleys. He came\nout and made this barricade.\n\nLater on, fatal circumstance, in London, proscribed by all, Barthelemy\nslew Cournet. It was a funereal duel. Some time afterwards, caught in\nthe gearing of one of those mysterious adventures in which passion\nplays a part, a catastrophe in which French justice sees extenuating\ncircumstances, and in which English justice sees only death, Barthelemy\nwas hanged. The sombre social construction is so made that, thanks to\nmaterial destitution, thanks to moral obscurity, that unhappy being\nwho possessed an intelligence, certainly firm, possibly great, began\nin France with the galleys, and ended in England with the gallows.\nBarthelemy, on occasion, flew but one flag, the black flag.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II--WHAT IS TO BE DONE IN THE ABYSS IF ONE DOES NOT CONVERSE\n\nSixteen years count in the subterranean education of insurrection, and\nJune, 1848, knew a great deal more about it than June, 1832. So the\nbarricade of the Rue de la Chanvrerie was only an outline, and an embryo\ncompared to the two colossal barricades which we have just sketched; but\nit was formidable for that epoch.\n\nThe insurgents under the eye of Enjolras, for Marius no longer looked\nafter anything, had made good use of the night. The barricade had been\nnot only repaired, but augmented. They had raised it two feet. Bars\nof iron planted in the pavement resembled lances in rest. All sorts of\nrubbish brought and added from all directions complicated the external\nconfusion. The redoubt had been cleverly made over, into a wall on the\ninside and a thicket on the outside.\n\nThe staircase of paving-stones which permitted one to mount it like the\nwall of a citadel had been reconstructed.\n\nThe barricade had been put in order, the tap-room disencumbered, the\nkitchen appropriated for the ambulance, the dressing of the wounded\ncompleted, the powder scattered on the ground and on the tables had been\ngathered up, bullets run, cartridges manufactured, lint scraped, the\nfallen weapons re-distributed, the interior of the redoubt cleaned, the\nrubbish swept up, corpses removed.\n\nThey laid the dead in a heap in the Mondetour lane, of which they were\nstill the masters. The pavement was red for a long time at that spot.\nAmong the dead there were four National Guardsmen of the suburbs.\nEnjolras had their uniforms laid aside.\n\nEnjolras had advised two hours of sleep. Advice from Enjolras was a\ncommand. Still, only three or four took advantage of it.\n\nFeuilly employed these two hours in engraving this inscription on the\nwall which faced the tavern:--\n\n                     LONG LIVE THE PEOPLES!\n\nThese four words, hollowed out in the rough stone with a nail, could be\nstill read on the wall in 1848.\n\nThe three women had profited by the respite of the night to vanish\ndefinitely; which allowed the insurgents to breathe more freely.\n\nThey had found means of taking refuge in some neighboring house.\n\nThe greater part of the wounded were able, and wished, to fight still.\nOn a litter of mattresses and trusses of straw in the kitchen, which had\nbeen converted into an ambulance, there were five men gravely wounded,\ntwo of whom were municipal guardsmen. The municipal guardsmen were\nattended to first.\n\nIn the tap-room there remained only Mabeuf under his black cloth and\nJavert bound to his post.\n\n\"This is the hall of the dead,\" said Enjolras.\n\nIn the interior of this hall, barely lighted by a candle at one end, the\nmortuary table being behind the post like a horizontal bar, a sort of\nvast, vague cross resulted from Javert erect and Mabeuf lying prone.\n\nThe pole of the omnibus, although snapped off by the fusillade, was\nstill sufficiently upright to admit of their fastening the flag to it.\n\nEnjolras, who possessed that quality of a leader, of always doing what\nhe said, attached to this staff the bullet-ridden and bloody coat of the\nold man's.\n\nNo repast had been possible. There was neither bread nor meat. The fifty\nmen in the barricade had speedily exhausted the scanty provisions of\nthe wine-shop during the sixteen hours which they had passed there. At a\ngiven moment, every barricade inevitably becomes the raft of la Meduse.\nThey were obliged to resign themselves to hunger. They had then reached\nthe first hours of that Spartan day of the 6th of June when, in the\nbarricade Saint-Merry, Jeanne, surrounded by the insurgents who demanded\nbread, replied to all combatants crying: \"Something to eat!\" with: \"Why?\nIt is three o'clock; at four we shall be dead.\"\n\nAs they could no longer eat, Enjolras forbade them to drink. He\ninterdicted wine, and portioned out the brandy.\n\nThey had found in the cellar fifteen full bottles hermetically sealed.\nEnjolras and Combeferre examined them. Combeferre when he came up again\nsaid:--\"It's the old stock of Father Hucheloup, who began business as\na grocer.\"--\"It must be real wine,\" observed Bossuet. \"It's lucky that\nGrantaire is asleep. If he were on foot, there would be a good deal of\ndifficulty in saving those bottles.\"--Enjolras, in spite of all murmurs,\nplaced his veto on the fifteen bottles, and, in order that no one might\ntouch them, he had them placed under the table on which Father Mabeuf\nwas lying.\n\nAbout two o'clock in the morning, they reckoned up their strength. There\nwere still thirty-seven of them.\n\nThe day began to dawn. The torch, which had been replaced in its\ncavity in the pavement, had just been extinguished. The interior of the\nbarricade, that species of tiny courtyard appropriated from the street,\nwas bathed in shadows, and resembled, athwart the vague, twilight\nhorror, the deck of a disabled ship. The combatants, as they went\nand came, moved about there like black forms. Above that terrible\nnesting-place of gloom the stories of the mute houses were lividly\noutlined; at the very top, the chimneys stood palely out. The sky was of\nthat charming, undecided hue, which may be white and may be blue. Birds\nflew about in it with cries of joy. The lofty house which formed the\nback of the barricade, being turned to the East, had upon its roof a\nrosy reflection. The morning breeze ruffled the gray hair on the head of\nthe dead man at the third-story window.\n\n\"I am delighted that the torch has been extinguished,\" said Courfeyrac\nto Feuilly. \"That torch flickering in the wind annoyed me. It had the\nappearance of being afraid. The light of torches resembles the wisdom of\ncowards; it gives a bad light because it trembles.\"\n\nDawn awakens minds as it does the birds; all began to talk.\n\nJoly, perceiving a cat prowling on a gutter, extracted philosophy from\nit.\n\n\"What is the cat?\" he exclaimed. \"It is a corrective. The good God,\nhaving made the mouse, said: 'Hullo! I have committed a blunder.' And\nso he made the cat. The cat is the erratum of the mouse. The mouse, plus\nthe cat, is the proof of creation revised and corrected.\"\n\nCombeferre, surrounded by students and artisans, was speaking of the\ndead, of Jean Prouvaire, of Bahorel, of Mabeuf, and even of Cabuc, and\nof Enjolras' sad severity. He said:--\n\n\"Harmodius and Aristogiton, Brutus, Chereas, Stephanus, Cromwell,\nCharlotte Corday, Sand, have all had their moment of agony when it was\ntoo late. Our hearts quiver so, and human life is such a mystery that,\neven in the case of a civic murder, even in a murder for liberation, if\nthere be such a thing, the remorse for having struck a man surpasses the\njoy of having served the human race.\"\n\nAnd, such are the windings of the exchange of speech, that, a moment\nlater, by a transition brought about through Jean Prouvaire's verses,\nCombeferre was comparing the translators of the Georgics, Raux with\nCournand, Cournand with Delille, pointing out the passages translated\nby Malfilatre, particularly the prodigies of Caesar's death; and at that\nword, Caesar, the conversation reverted to Brutus.\n\n\"Caesar,\" said Combeferre, \"fell justly. Cicero was severe towards\nCaesar, and he was right. That severity is not diatribe. When Zoilus\ninsults Homer, when Maevius insults Virgil, when Vise insults Moliere,\nwhen Pope insults Shakspeare, when Frederic insults Voltaire, it is an\nold law of envy and hatred which is being carried out; genius attracts\ninsult, great men are always more or less barked at. But Zoilus and\nCicero are two different persons. Cicero is an arbiter in thought, just\nas Brutus is an arbiter by the sword. For my own part, I blame that last\njustice, the blade; but, antiquity admitted it. Caesar, the violator\nof the Rubicon, conferring, as though they came from him, the dignities\nwhich emanated from the people, not rising at the entrance of the\nsenate, committed the acts of a king and almost of a tyrant, regia ac\npene tyrannica. He was a great man; so much the worse, or so much the\nbetter; the lesson is but the more exalted. His twenty-three wounds\ntouch me less than the spitting in the face of Jesus Christ. Caesar is\nstabbed by the senators; Christ is cuffed by lackeys. One feels the God\nthrough the greater outrage.\"\n\nBossuet, who towered above the interlocutors from the summit of a heap\nof paving-stones, exclaimed, rifle in hand:--\n\n\"Oh Cydathenaeum, Oh Myrrhinus, Oh Probalinthus, Oh graces of the\nAEantides! Oh! Who will grant me to pronounce the verses of Homer like a\nGreek of Laurium or of Edapteon?\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III--LIGHT AND SHADOW\n\nEnjolras had been to make a reconnaissance. He had made his way out\nthrough Mondetour lane, gliding along close to the houses.\n\nThe insurgents, we will remark, were full of hope. The manner in which\nthey had repulsed the attack of the preceding night had caused them to\nalmost disdain in advance the attack at dawn. They waited for it with\na smile. They had no more doubt as to their success than as to their\ncause. Moreover, succor was, evidently, on the way to them. They\nreckoned on it. With that facility of triumphant prophecy which is one\nof the sources of strength in the French combatant, they divided the\nday which was at hand into three distinct phases. At six o'clock in the\nmorning a regiment \"which had been labored with,\" would turn; at noon,\nthe insurrection of all Paris; at sunset, revolution.\n\nThey heard the alarm bell of Saint-Merry, which had not been silent for\nan instant since the night before; a proof that the other barricade, the\ngreat one, Jeanne's, still held out.\n\nAll these hopes were exchanged between the different groups in a sort of\ngay and formidable whisper which resembled the warlike hum of a hive of\nbees.\n\nEnjolras reappeared. He returned from his sombre eagle flight into outer\ndarkness. He listened for a moment to all this joy with folded arms, and\none hand on his mouth. Then, fresh and rosy in the growing whiteness of\nthe dawn, he said:\n\n\"The whole army of Paris is to strike. A third of the army is bearing\ndown upon the barricades in which you now are. There is the National\nGuard in addition. I have picked out the shakos of the fifth of the\nline, and the standard-bearers of the sixth legion. In one hour you will\nbe attacked. As for the populace, it was seething yesterday, to-day\nit is not stirring. There is nothing to expect; nothing to hope for.\nNeither from a faubourg nor from a regiment. You are abandoned.\"\n\nThese words fell upon the buzzing of the groups, and produced on them\nthe effect caused on a swarm of bees by the first drops of a storm. A\nmoment of indescribable silence ensued, in which death might have been\nheard flitting by.\n\nThis moment was brief.\n\nA voice from the obscurest depths of the groups shouted to Enjolras:\n\n\"So be it. Let us raise the barricade to a height of twenty feet, and\nlet us all remain in it. Citizens, let us offer the protests of corpses.\nLet us show that, if the people abandon the republicans, the republicans\ndo not abandon the people.\"\n\nThese words freed the thought of all from the painful cloud of\nindividual anxieties. It was hailed with an enthusiastic acclamation.\n\nNo one ever has known the name of the man who spoke thus; he was some\nunknown blouse-wearer, a stranger, a man forgotten, a passing hero, that\ngreat anonymous, always mingled in human crises and in social geneses\nwho, at a given moment, utters in a supreme fashion the decisive word,\nand who vanishes into the shadows after having represented for a minute,\nin a lightning flash, the people and God.\n\nThis inexorable resolution so thoroughly impregnated the air of the\n6th of June, 1832, that, almost at the very same hour, on the barricade\nSaint-Merry, the insurgents were raising that clamor which has become a\nmatter of history and which has been consigned to the documents in the\ncase:--\"What matters it whether they come to our assistance or not? Let\nus get ourselves killed here, to the very last man.\"\n\nAs the reader sees, the two barricades, though materially isolated, were\nin communication with each other.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV--MINUS FIVE, PLUS ONE\n\nAfter the man who decreed the \"protest of corpses\" had spoken, and had\ngiven this formula of their common soul, there issued from all mouths a\nstrangely satisfied and terrible cry, funereal in sense and triumphant\nin tone:\n\n\"Long live death! Let us all remain here!\"\n\n\"Why all?\" said Enjolras.\n\n\"All! All!\"\n\nEnjolras resumed:\n\n\"The position is good; the barricade is fine. Thirty men are enough. Why\nsacrifice forty?\"\n\nThey replied:\n\n\"Because not one will go away.\"\n\n\"Citizens,\" cried Enjolras, and there was an almost irritated vibration\nin his voice, \"this republic is not rich enough in men to indulge in\nuseless expenditure of them. Vain-glory is waste. If the duty of some is\nto depart, that duty should be fulfilled like any other.\"\n\nEnjolras, the man-principle, had over his co-religionists that sort of\nomnipotent power which emanates from the absolute. Still, great as was\nthis omnipotence, a murmur arose. A leader to the very finger-tips,\nEnjolras, seeing that they murmured, insisted. He resumed haughtily:\n\n\"Let those who are afraid of not numbering more than thirty say so.\"\n\nThe murmurs redoubled.\n\n\"Besides,\" observed a voice in one group, \"it is easy enough to talk\nabout leaving. The barricade is hemmed in.\"\n\n\"Not on the side of the Halles,\" said Enjolras. \"The Rue Mondetour is\nfree, and through the Rue des Precheurs one can reach the Marche des\nInnocents.\"\n\n\"And there,\" went on another voice, \"you would be captured. You would\nfall in with some grand guard of the line or the suburbs; they will spy\na man passing in blouse and cap. 'Whence come you?' 'Don't you belong to\nthe barricade?' And they will look at your hands. You smell of powder.\nShot.\"\n\nEnjolras, without making any reply, touched Combeferre's shoulder, and\nthe two entered the tap-room.\n\nThey emerged thence a moment later. Enjolras held in his outstretched\nhands the four uniforms which he had laid aside. Combeferre followed,\ncarrying the shoulder-belts and the shakos.\n\n\"With this uniform,\" said Enjolras, \"you can mingle with the ranks and\nescape; here is enough for four.\" And he flung on the ground, deprived\nof its pavement, the four uniforms.\n\nNo wavering took place in his stoical audience. Combeferre took the\nword.\n\n\"Come,\" said he, \"you must have a little pity. Do you know what the\nquestion is here? It is a question of women. See here. Are there\nwomen or are there not? Are there children or are there not? Are there\nmothers, yes or no, who rock cradles with their foot and who have a lot\nof little ones around them? Let that man of you who has never beheld a\nnurse's breast raise his hand. Ah! you want to get yourselves killed, so\ndo I--I, who am speaking to you; but I do not want to feel the phantoms\nof women wreathing their arms around me. Die, if you will, but\ndon't make others die. Suicides like that which is on the brink of\naccomplishment here are sublime; but suicide is narrow, and does not\nadmit of extension; and as soon as it touches your neighbors, suicide\nis murder. Think of the little blond heads; think of the white locks.\nListen, Enjolras has just told me that he saw at the corner of the Rue\ndu Cygne a lighted casement, a candle in a poor window, on the fifth\nfloor, and on the pane the quivering shadow of the head of an old woman,\nwho had the air of having spent the night in watching. Perhaps she is\nthe mother of some one of you. Well, let that man go, and make haste, to\nsay to his mother: 'Here I am, mother!' Let him feel at ease, the task\nhere will be performed all the same. When one supports one's relatives\nby one's toil, one has not the right to sacrifice one's self. That\nis deserting one's family. And those who have daughters! what are you\nthinking of? You get yourselves killed, you are dead, that is well. And\ntomorrow? Young girls without bread--that is a terrible thing. Man begs,\nwoman sells. Ah! those charming and gracious beings, so gracious and so\nsweet, who have bonnets of flowers, who fill the house with purity, who\nsing and prattle, who are like a living perfume, who prove the existence\nof angels in heaven by the purity of virgins on earth, that Jeanne,\nthat Lise, that Mimi, those adorable and honest creatures who are your\nblessings and your pride, ah! good God, they will suffer hunger! What do\nyou want me to say to you? There is a market for human flesh; and it\nis not with your shadowy hands, shuddering around them, that you\nwill prevent them from entering it! Think of the street, think of the\npavement covered with passers-by, think of the shops past which women\ngo and come with necks all bare, and through the mire. These women,\ntoo, were pure once. Think of your sisters, those of you who have them.\nMisery, prostitution, the police, Saint-Lazare--that is what those\nbeautiful, delicate girls, those fragile marvels of modesty, gentleness\nand loveliness, fresher than lilacs in the month of May, will come to.\nAh! you have got yourselves killed! You are no longer on hand! That\nis well; you have wished to release the people from Royalty, and you\ndeliver over your daughters to the police. Friends, have a care, have\nmercy. Women, unhappy women, we are not in the habit of bestowing much\nthought on them. We trust to the women not having received a man's\neducation, we prevent their reading, we prevent their thinking, we\nprevent their occupying themselves with politics; will you prevent them\nfrom going to the dead-house this evening, and recognizing your bodies?\nLet us see, those who have families must be tractable, and shake hands\nwith us and take themselves off, and leave us here alone to attend to\nthis affair. I know well that courage is required to leave, that it is\nhard; but the harder it is, the more meritorious. You say: 'I have a\ngun, I am at the barricade; so much the worse, I shall remain there.' So\nmuch the worse is easily said. My friends, there is a morrow; you will\nnot be here to-morrow, but your families will; and what sufferings! See,\nhere is a pretty, healthy child, with cheeks like an apple, who babbles,\nprattles, chatters, who laughs, who smells sweet beneath your kiss,--and\ndo you know what becomes of him when he is abandoned? I have seen one,\na very small creature, no taller than that. His father was dead. Poor\npeople had taken him in out of charity, but they had bread only for\nthemselves. The child was always hungry. It was winter. He did not cry.\nYou could see him approach the stove, in which there was never any fire,\nand whose pipe, you know, was of mastic and yellow clay. His breathing\nwas hoarse, his face livid, his limbs flaccid, his belly prominent. He\nsaid nothing. If you spoke to him, he did not answer. He is dead. He was\ntaken to the Necker Hospital, where I saw him. I was house-surgeon in\nthat hospital. Now, if there are any fathers among you, fathers whose\nhappiness it is to stroll on Sundays holding their child's tiny hand in\ntheir robust hand, let each one of those fathers imagine that this child\nis his own. That poor brat, I remember, and I seem to see him now, when\nhe lay nude on the dissecting table, how his ribs stood out on his skin\nlike the graves beneath the grass in a cemetery. A sort of mud was found\nin his stomach. There were ashes in his teeth. Come, let us examine\nourselves conscientiously and take counsel with our heart. Statistics\nshow that the mortality among abandoned children is fifty-five per cent.\nI repeat, it is a question of women, it concerns mothers, it concerns\nyoung girls, it concerns little children. Who is talking to you of\nyourselves? We know well what you are; we know well that you are all\nbrave, parbleu! we know well that you all have in your souls the joy and\nthe glory of giving your life for the great cause; we know well that you\nfeel yourselves elected to die usefully and magnificently, and that each\none of you clings to his share in the triumph. Very well. But you are\nnot alone in this world. There are other beings of whom you must think.\nYou must not be egoists.\"\n\nAll dropped their heads with a gloomy air.\n\nStrange contradictions of the human heart at its most sublime moments.\nCombeferre, who spoke thus, was not an orphan. He recalled the mothers\nof other men, and forgot his own. He was about to get himself killed. He\nwas \"an egoist.\"\n\nMarius, fasting, fevered, having emerged in succession from all hope,\nand having been stranded in grief, the most sombre of shipwrecks, and\nsaturated with violent emotions and conscious that the end was near,\nhad plunged deeper and deeper into that visionary stupor which always\nprecedes the fatal hour voluntarily accepted.\n\nA physiologist might have studied in him the growing symptoms of that\nfebrile absorption known to, and classified by, science, and which is\nto suffering what voluptuousness is to pleasure. Despair, also, has its\necstasy. Marius had reached this point. He looked on at everything as\nfrom without; as we have said, things which passed before him seemed far\naway; he made out the whole, but did not perceive the details. He beheld\nmen going and coming as through a flame. He heard voices speaking as at\nthe bottom of an abyss.\n\nBut this moved him. There was in this scene a point which pierced and\nroused even him. He had but one idea now, to die; and he did not wish to\nbe turned aside from it, but he reflected, in his gloomy somnambulism,\nthat while destroying himself, he was not prohibited from saving some\none else.\n\nHe raised his voice.\n\n\"Enjolras and Combeferre are right,\" said he; \"no unnecessary sacrifice.\nI join them, and you must make haste. Combeferre has said convincing\nthings to you. There are some among you who have families, mothers,\nsisters, wives, children. Let such leave the ranks.\"\n\nNo one stirred.\n\n\"Married men and the supporters of families, step out of the ranks!\"\nrepeated Marius.\n\nHis authority was great. Enjolras was certainly the head of the\nbarricade, but Marius was its savior.\n\n\"I order it,\" cried Enjolras.\n\n\"I entreat you,\" said Marius.\n\nThen, touched by Combeferre's words, shaken by Enjolras' order, touched\nby Marius' entreaty, these heroic men began to denounce each other.--\"It\nis true,\" said one young man to a full grown man, \"you are the father\nof a family. Go.\"--\"It is your duty rather,\" retorted the man, \"you have\ntwo sisters whom you maintain.\"--And an unprecedented controversy broke\nforth. Each struggled to determine which should not allow himself to be\nplaced at the door of the tomb.\n\n\"Make haste,\" said Courfeyrac, \"in another quarter of an hour it will be\ntoo late.\"\n\n\"Citizens,\" pursued Enjolras, \"this is the Republic, and universal\nsuffrage reigns. Do you yourselves designate those who are to go.\"\n\nThey obeyed. After the expiration of a few minutes, five were\nunanimously selected and stepped out of the ranks.\n\n\"There are five of them!\" exclaimed Marius.\n\nThere were only four uniforms.\n\n\"Well,\" began the five, \"one must stay behind.\"\n\nAnd then a struggle arose as to who should remain, and who should find\nreasons for the others not remaining. The generous quarrel began afresh.\n\n\"You have a wife who loves you.\"--\"You have your aged mother.\"--\" You\nhave neither father nor mother, and what is to become of your three\nlittle brothers?\"--\"You are the father of five children.\"--\"You have a\nright to live, you are only seventeen, it is too early for you to die.\"\n\nThese great revolutionary barricades were assembling points for heroism.\nThe improbable was simple there. These men did not astonish each other.\n\n\"Be quick,\" repeated Courfeyrac.\n\nMen shouted to Marius from the groups:\n\n\"Do you designate who is to remain.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said the five, \"choose. We will obey you.\"\n\nMarius did not believe that he was capable of another emotion. Still,\nat this idea, that of choosing a man for death, his blood rushed back\nto his heart. He would have turned pale, had it been possible for him to\nbecome any paler.\n\nHe advanced towards the five, who smiled upon him, and each, with his\neyes full of that grand flame which one beholds in the depths of history\nhovering over Thermopylae, cried to him:\n\n\"Me! me! me!\"\n\nAnd Marius stupidly counted them; there were still five of them! Then\nhis glance dropped to the four uniforms.\n\nAt that moment, a fifth uniform fell, as if from heaven, upon the other\nfour.\n\nThe fifth man was saved.\n\nMarius raised his eyes and recognized M. Fauchelevent.\n\nJean Valjean had just entered the barricade.\n\nHe had arrived by way of Mondetour lane, whither by dint of inquiries\nmade, or by instinct, or chance. Thanks to his dress of a National\nGuardsman, he had made his way without difficulty.\n\nThe sentinel stationed by the insurgents in the Rue Mondetour had no\noccasion to give the alarm for a single National Guardsman, and he had\nallowed the latter to entangle himself in the street, saying to himself:\n\"Probably it is a reinforcement, in any case it is a prisoner.\" The\nmoment was too grave to admit of the sentinel abandoning his duty and\nhis post of observation.\n\nAt the moment when Jean Valjean entered the redoubt, no one had noticed\nhim, all eyes being fixed on the five chosen men and the four uniforms.\nJean Valjean also had seen and heard, and he had silently removed his\ncoat and flung it on the pile with the rest.\n\nThe emotion aroused was indescribable.\n\n\"Who is this man?\" demanded Bossuet.\n\n\"He is a man who saves others,\" replied Combeferre.\n\nMarius added in a grave voice:\n\n\"I know him.\"\n\nThis guarantee satisfied every one.\n\nEnjolras turned to Jean Valjean.\n\n\"Welcome, citizen.\"\n\nAnd he added:\n\n\"You know that we are about to die.\"\n\nJean Valjean, without replying, helped the insurgent whom he was saving\nto don his uniform.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V--THE HORIZON WHICH ONE BEHOLDS FROM THE SUMMIT OF A BARRICADE\n\nThe situation of all in that fatal hour and that pitiless place, had as\nresult and culminating point Enjolras' supreme melancholy.\n\nEnjolras bore within him the plenitude of the revolution; he was\nincomplete, however, so far as the absolute can be so; he had too much\nof Saint-Just about him, and not enough of Anacharsis Cloots; still,\nhis mind, in the society of the Friends of the A B C, had ended by\nundergoing a certain polarization from Combeferre's ideas; for some time\npast, he had been gradually emerging from the narrow form of dogma, and\nhad allowed himself to incline to the broadening influence of progress,\nand he had come to accept, as a definitive and magnificent evolution,\nthe transformation of the great French Republic, into the immense\nhuman republic. As far as the immediate means were concerned, a violent\nsituation being given, he wished to be violent; on that point, he never\nvaried; and he remained of that epic and redoubtable school which is\nsummed up in the words: \"Eighty-three.\" Enjolras was standing erect on\nthe staircase of paving-stones, one elbow resting on the stock of\nhis gun. He was engaged in thought; he quivered, as at the passage of\nprophetic breaths; places where death is have these effects of tripods.\nA sort of stifled fire darted from his eyes, which were filled with an\ninward look. All at once he threw back his head, his blond locks fell\nback like those of an angel on the sombre quadriga made of stars, they\nwere like the mane of a startled lion in the flaming of an halo, and\nEnjolras cried:\n\n\"Citizens, do you picture the future to yourselves? The streets of\ncities inundated with light, green branches on the thresholds, nations\nsisters, men just, old men blessing children, the past loving the\npresent, thinkers entirely at liberty, believers on terms of full\nequality, for religion heaven, God the direct priest, human conscience\nbecome an altar, no more hatreds, the fraternity of the workshop and the\nschool, for sole penalty and recompense fame, work for all, right for\nall, peace over all, no more bloodshed, no more wars, happy mothers! To\nconquer matter is the first step; to realize the ideal is the second.\nReflect on what progress has already accomplished. Formerly, the\nfirst human races beheld with terror the hydra pass before their eyes,\nbreathing on the waters, the dragon which vomited flame, the griffin who\nwas the monster of the air, and who flew with the wings of an eagle\nand the talons of a tiger; fearful beasts which were above man. Man,\nnevertheless, spread his snares, consecrated by intelligence, and\nfinally conquered these monsters. We have vanquished the hydra, and\nit is called the locomotive; we are on the point of vanquishing the\ngriffin, we already grasp it, and it is called the balloon. On the day\nwhen this Promethean task shall be accomplished, and when man shall have\ndefinitely harnessed to his will the triple Chimaera of antiquity, the\nhydra, the dragon and the griffin, he will be the master of water, fire,\nand of air, and he will be for the rest of animated creation that which\nthe ancient gods formerly were to him. Courage, and onward! Citizens,\nwhither are we going? To science made government, to the force of things\nbecome the sole public force, to the natural law, having in itself its\nsanction and its penalty and promulgating itself by evidence, to a dawn\nof truth corresponding to a dawn of day. We are advancing to the union\nof peoples; we are advancing to the unity of man. No more fictions;\nno more parasites. The real governed by the true, that is the goal.\nCivilization will hold its assizes at the summit of Europe, and,\nlater on, at the centre of continents, in a grand parliament of the\nintelligence. Something similar has already been seen. The amphictyons\nhad two sittings a year, one at Delphos the seat of the gods, the other\nat Thermopylae, the place of heroes. Europe will have her amphictyons;\nthe globe will have its amphictyons. France bears this sublime future in\nher breast. This is the gestation of the nineteenth century. That which\nGreece sketched out is worthy of being finished by France. Listen to me,\nyou, Feuilly, valiant artisan, man of the people. I revere you. Yes, you\nclearly behold the future, yes, you are right. You had neither father\nnor mother, Feuilly; you adopted humanity for your mother and right\nfor your father. You are about to die, that is to say to triumph, here.\nCitizens, whatever happens to-day, through our defeat as well as\nthrough our victory, it is a revolution that we are about to create.\nAs conflagrations light up a whole city, so revolutions illuminate the\nwhole human race. And what is the revolution that we shall cause? I have\njust told you, the Revolution of the True. From a political point of\nview, there is but a single principle; the sovereignty of man over\nhimself. This sovereignty of myself over myself is called Liberty. Where\ntwo or three of these sovereignties are combined, the state begins. But\nin that association there is no abdication. Each sovereignty concedes a\ncertain quantity of itself, for the purpose of forming the common right.\nThis quantity is the same for all of us. This identity of concession\nwhich each makes to all, is called Equality. Common right is nothing\nelse than the protection of all beaming on the right of each. This\nprotection of all over each is called Fraternity. The point of\nintersection of all these assembled sovereignties is called society.\nThis intersection being a junction, this point is a knot. Hence what\nis called the social bond. Some say social contract; which is the same\nthing, the word contract being etymologically formed with the idea of a\nbond. Let us come to an understanding about equality; for, if liberty\nis the summit, equality is the base. Equality, citizens, is not wholly a\nsurface vegetation, a society of great blades of grass and tiny oaks; a\nproximity of jealousies which render each other null and void; legally\nspeaking, it is all aptitudes possessed of the same opportunity;\npolitically, it is all votes possessed of the same weight; religiously,\nit is all consciences possessed of the same right. Equality has an\norgan: gratuitous and obligatory instruction. The right to the alphabet,\nthat is where the beginning must be made. The primary school imposed\non all, the secondary school offered to all, that is the law. From an\nidentical school, an identical society will spring. Yes, instruction!\nlight! light! everything comes from light, and to it everything returns.\nCitizens, the nineteenth century is great, but the twentieth century\nwill be happy. Then, there will be nothing more like the history of old,\nwe shall no longer, as to-day, have to fear a conquest, an invasion,\na usurpation, a rivalry of nations, arms in hand, an interruption of\ncivilization depending on a marriage of kings, on a birth in hereditary\ntyrannies, a partition of peoples by a congress, a dismemberment because\nof the failure of a dynasty, a combat of two religions meeting face\nto face, like two bucks in the dark, on the bridge of the infinite; we\nshall no longer have to fear famine, farming out, prostitution arising\nfrom distress, misery from the failure of work and the scaffold and the\nsword, and battles and the ruffianism of chance in the forest of events.\nOne might almost say: There will be no more events. We shall be happy.\nThe human race will accomplish its law, as the terrestrial globe\naccomplishes its law; harmony will be re-established between the soul\nand the star; the soul will gravitate around the truth, as the planet\naround the light. Friends, the present hour in which I am addressing\nyou, is a gloomy hour; but these are terrible purchases of the future.\nA revolution is a toll. Oh! the human race will be delivered, raised up,\nconsoled! We affirm it on this barrier. Whence should proceed that cry\nof love, if not from the heights of sacrifice? Oh my brothers, this is\nthe point of junction, of those who think and of those who suffer; this\nbarricade is not made of paving-stones, nor of joists, nor of bits of\niron; it is made of two heaps, a heap of ideas, and a heap of woes. Here\nmisery meets the ideal. The day embraces the night, and says to it: 'I\nam about to die, and thou shalt be born again with me.' From the embrace\nof all desolations faith leaps forth. Sufferings bring hither their\nagony and ideas their immortality. This agony and this immortality are\nabout to join and constitute our death. Brothers, he who dies here dies\nin the radiance of the future, and we are entering a tomb all flooded\nwith the dawn.\"\n\nEnjolras paused rather than became silent; his lips continued to move\nsilently, as though he were talking to himself, which caused them all\nto gaze attentively at him, in the endeavor to hear more. There was no\napplause; but they whispered together for a long time. Speech being a\nbreath, the rustling of intelligences resembles the rustling of leaves.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI--MARIUS HAGGARD, JAVERT LACONIC\n\nLet us narrate what was passing in Marius' thoughts.\n\nLet the reader recall the state of his soul. We have just recalled it,\neverything was a vision to him now. His judgment was disturbed. Marius,\nlet us insist on this point, was under the shadow of the great, dark\nwings which are spread over those in the death agony. He felt that he\nhad entered the tomb, it seemed to him that he was already on the other\nside of the wall, and he no longer beheld the faces of the living except\nwith the eyes of one dead.\n\nHow did M. Fauchelevent come there? Why was he there? What had he come\nthere to do? Marius did not address all these questions to himself.\nBesides, since our despair has this peculiarity, that it envelops others\nas well as ourselves, it seemed logical to him that all the world should\ncome thither to die.\n\nOnly, he thought of Cosette with a pang at his heart.\n\nHowever, M. Fauchelevent did not speak to him, did not look at him, and\nhad not even the air of hearing him, when Marius raised his voice to\nsay: \"I know him.\"\n\nAs far as Marius was concerned, this attitude of M. Fauchelevent was\ncomforting, and, if such a word can be used for such impressions,\nwe should say that it pleased him. He had always felt the absolute\nimpossibility of addressing that enigmatical man, who was, in his eyes,\nboth equivocal and imposing. Moreover, it had been a long time since\nhe had seen him; and this still further augmented the impossibility for\nMarius' timid and reserved nature.\n\nThe five chosen men left the barricade by way of Mondetour lane; they\nbore a perfect resemblance to members of the National Guard. One of them\nwept as he took his leave. Before setting out, they embraced those who\nremained.\n\nWhen the five men sent back to life had taken their departure, Enjolras\nthought of the man who had been condemned to death.\n\nHe entered the tap-room. Javert, still bound to the post, was engaged in\nmeditation.\n\n\"Do you want anything?\" Enjolras asked him.\n\nJavert replied: \"When are you going to kill me?\"\n\n\"Wait. We need all our cartridges just at present.\"\n\n\"Then give me a drink,\" said Javert.\n\nEnjolras himself offered him a glass of water, and, as Javert was\npinioned, he helped him to drink.\n\n\"Is that all?\" inquired Enjolras.\n\n\"I am uncomfortable against this post,\" replied Javert. \"You are not\ntender to have left me to pass the night here. Bind me as you please,\nbut you surely might lay me out on a table like that other man.\"\n\nAnd with a motion of the head, he indicated the body of M. Mabeuf.\n\nThere was, as the reader will remember, a long, broad table at the\nend of the room, on which they had been running bullets and making\ncartridges. All the cartridges having been made, and all the powder\nused, this table was free.\n\nAt Enjolras' command, four insurgents unbound Javert from the post.\nWhile they were loosing him, a fifth held a bayonet against his breast.\n\nLeaving his arms tied behind his back, they placed about his feet a\nslender but stout whip-cord, as is done to men on the point of mounting\nthe scaffold, which allowed him to take steps about fifteen inches in\nlength, and made him walk to the table at the end of the room, where\nthey laid him down, closely bound about the middle of the body.\n\nBy way of further security, and by means of a rope fastened to his neck,\nthey added to the system of ligatures which rendered every attempt\nat escape impossible, that sort of bond which is called in prisons a\nmartingale, which, starting at the neck, forks on the stomach, and meets\nthe hands, after passing between the legs.\n\nWhile they were binding Javert, a man standing on the threshold was\nsurveying him with singular attention. The shadow cast by this man made\nJavert turn his head. He raised his eyes, and recognized Jean Valjean.\nHe did not even start, but dropped his lids proudly and confined himself\nto the remark: \"It is perfectly simple.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII--THE SITUATION BECOMES AGGRAVATED\n\nThe daylight was increasing rapidly. Not a window was opened, not a door\nstood ajar; it was the dawn but not the awaking. The end of the Rue de\nla Chanvrerie, opposite the barricade, had been evacuated by the\ntroops, as we have stated it seemed to be free, and presented itself to\npassers-by with a sinister tranquillity. The Rue Saint-Denis was as\ndumb as the avenue of Sphinxes at Thebes. Not a living being in the\ncross-roads, which gleamed white in the light of the sun. Nothing is so\nmournful as this light in deserted streets. Nothing was to be seen, but\nthere was something to be heard. A mysterious movement was going on at\na certain distance. It was evident that the critical moment was\napproaching. As on the previous evening, the sentinels had come in; but\nthis time all had come.\n\nThe barricade was stronger than on the occasion of the first attack.\nSince the departure of the five, they had increased its height still\nfurther.\n\nOn the advice of the sentinel who had examined the region of the\nHalles, Enjolras, for fear of a surprise in the rear, came to a serious\ndecision. He had the small gut of the Mondetour lane, which had been\nleft open up to that time, barricaded. For this purpose, they tore up\nthe pavement for the length of several houses more. In this manner,\nthe barricade, walled on three streets, in front on the Rue de\nla Chanvrerie, to the left on the Rues du Cygne and de la Petite\nTruanderie, to the right on the Rue Mondetour, was really almost\nimpregnable; it is true that they were fatally hemmed in there. It\nhad three fronts, but no exit.--\"A fortress but a rat hole too,\" said\nCourfeyrac with a laugh.\n\nEnjolras had about thirty paving-stones \"torn up in excess,\" said\nBossuet, piled up near the door of the wine-shop.\n\nThe silence was now so profound in the quarter whence the attack must\nneeds come, that Enjolras had each man resume his post of battle.\n\nAn allowance of brandy was doled out to each.\n\nNothing is more curious than a barricade preparing for an assault. Each\nman selects his place as though at the theatre. They jostle, and elbow\nand crowd each other. There are some who make stalls of paving-stones.\nHere is a corner of the wall which is in the way, it is removed; here\nis a redan which may afford protection, they take shelter behind it.\nLeft-handed men are precious; they take the places that are inconvenient\nto the rest. Many arrange to fight in a sitting posture. They wish to be\nat ease to kill, and to die comfortably. In the sad war of June, 1848,\nan insurgent who was a formidable marksman, and who was firing from the\ntop of a terrace upon a roof, had a reclining-chair brought there for\nhis use; a charge of grape-shot found him out there.\n\nAs soon as the leader has given the order to clear the decks for action,\nall disorderly movements cease; there is no more pulling from one\nanother; there are no more coteries; no more asides, there is no more\nholding aloof; everything in their spirits converges in, and changes\ninto, a waiting for the assailants. A barricade before the arrival of\ndanger is chaos; in danger, it is discipline itself. Peril produces\norder.\n\nAs soon as Enjolras had seized his double-barrelled rifle, and had\nplaced himself in a sort of embrasure which he had reserved for himself,\nall the rest held their peace. A series of faint, sharp noises resounded\nconfusedly along the wall of paving-stones. It was the men cocking their\nguns.\n\nMoreover, their attitudes were prouder, more confident than ever; the\nexcess of sacrifice strengthens; they no longer cherished any hope,\nbut they had despair, despair,--the last weapon, which sometimes gives\nvictory; Virgil has said so. Supreme resources spring from extreme\nresolutions. To embark in death is sometimes the means of escaping a\nshipwreck; and the lid of the coffin becomes a plank of safety.\n\nAs on the preceding evening, the attention of all was directed, we\nmight almost say leaned upon, the end of the street, now lighted up and\nvisible.\n\nThey had not long to wait. A stir began distinctly in the Saint-Leu\nquarter, but it did not resemble the movement of the first attack. A\nclashing of chains, the uneasy jolting of a mass, the click of brass\nskipping along the pavement, a sort of solemn uproar, announced that\nsome sinister construction of iron was approaching. There arose a tremor\nin the bosoms of these peaceful old streets, pierced and built for the\nfertile circulation of interests and ideas, and which are not made for\nthe horrible rumble of the wheels of war.\n\nThe fixity of eye in all the combatants upon the extremity of the street\nbecame ferocious.\n\nA cannon made its appearance.\n\nArtillery-men were pushing the piece; it was in firing trim; the\nfore-carriage had been detached; two upheld the gun-carriage, four were\nat the wheels; others followed with the caisson. They could see the\nsmoke of the burning lint-stock.\n\n\"Fire!\" shouted Enjolras.\n\nThe whole barricade fired, the report was terrible; an avalanche of\nsmoke covered and effaced both cannon and men; after a few seconds, the\ncloud dispersed, and the cannon and men re-appeared; the gun-crew had\njust finished rolling it slowly, correctly, without haste, into position\nfacing the barricade. Not one of them had been struck. Then the captain\nof the piece, bearing down upon the breech in order to raise the muzzle,\nbegan to point the cannon with the gravity of an astronomer levelling a\ntelescope.\n\n\"Bravo for the cannoneers!\" cried Bossuet.\n\nAnd the whole barricade clapped their hands.\n\nA moment later, squarely planted in the very middle of the street,\nastride of the gutter, the piece was ready for action. A formidable pair\nof jaws yawned on the barricade.\n\n\"Come, merrily now!\" ejaculated Courfeyrac. \"That's the brutal part of\nit. After the fillip on the nose, the blow from the fist. The army is\nreaching out its big paw to us. The barricade is going to be severely\nshaken up. The fusillade tries, the cannon takes.\"\n\n\"It is a piece of eight, new model, brass,\" added Combeferre. \"Those\npieces are liable to burst as soon as the proportion of ten parts of tin\nto one hundred of brass is exceeded. The excess of tin renders them too\ntender. Then it comes to pass that they have caves and chambers when\nlooked at from the vent hole. In order to obviate this danger, and\nto render it possible to force the charge, it may become necessary\nto return to the process of the fourteenth century, hooping, and to\nencircle the piece on the outside with a series of unwelded steel bands,\nfrom the breech to the trunnions. In the meantime, they remedy this\ndefect as best they may; they manage to discover where the holes are\nlocated in the vent of a cannon, by means of a searcher. But there is a\nbetter method, with Gribeauval's movable star.\"\n\n\"In the sixteenth century,\" remarked Bossuet, \"they used to rifle\ncannon.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" replied Combeferre, \"that augments the projectile force, but\ndiminishes the accuracy of the firing. In firing at short range,\nthe trajectory is not as rigid as could be desired, the parabola is\nexaggerated, the line of the projectile is no longer sufficiently\nrectilinear to allow of its striking intervening objects, which is,\nnevertheless, a necessity of battle, the importance of which increases\nwith the proximity of the enemy and the precipitation of the discharge.\nThis defect of the tension of the curve of the projectile in the rifled\ncannon of the sixteenth century arose from the smallness of the charge;\nsmall charges for that sort of engine are imposed by the ballistic\nnecessities, such, for instance, as the preservation of the\ngun-carriage. In short, that despot, the cannon, cannot do all that\nit desires; force is a great weakness. A cannon-ball only travels\nsix hundred leagues an hour; light travels seventy thousand leagues a\nsecond. Such is the superiority of Jesus Christ over Napoleon.\"\n\n\"Reload your guns,\" said Enjolras.\n\nHow was the casing of the barricade going to behave under the\ncannon-balls? Would they effect a breach? That was the question. While\nthe insurgents were reloading their guns, the artillery-men were loading\nthe cannon.\n\nThe anxiety in the redoubt was profound.\n\nThe shot sped the report burst forth.\n\n\"Present!\" shouted a joyous voice.\n\nAnd Gavroche flung himself into the barricade just as the ball dashed\nagainst it.\n\nHe came from the direction of the Rue du Cygne, and he had nimbly\nclimbed over the auxiliary barricade which fronted on the labyrinth of\nthe Rue de la Petite Truanderie.\n\nGavroche produced a greater sensation in the barricade than the\ncannon-ball.\n\nThe ball buried itself in the mass of rubbish. At the most there was an\nomnibus wheel broken, and the old Anceau cart was demolished. On seeing\nthis, the barricade burst into a laugh.\n\n\"Go on!\" shouted Bossuet to the artillerists.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII--THE ARTILLERY-MEN COMPEL PEOPLE TO TAKE THEM SERIOUSLY\n\nThey flocked round Gavroche. But he had no time to tell anything. Marius\ndrew him aside with a shudder.\n\n\"What are you doing here?\"\n\n\"Hullo!\" said the child, \"what are you doing here yourself?\"\n\nAnd he stared at Marius intently with his epic effrontery. His eyes grew\nlarger with the proud light within them.\n\nIt was with an accent of severity that Marius continued:\n\n\"Who told you to come back? Did you deliver my letter at the address?\"\n\nGavroche was not without some compunctions in the matter of that letter.\nIn his haste to return to the barricade, he had got rid of it rather\nthan delivered it. He was forced to acknowledge to himself that he had\nconfided it rather lightly to that stranger whose face he had not been\nable to make out. It is true that the man was bareheaded, but that was\nnot sufficient. In short, he had been administering to himself little\ninward remonstrances and he feared Marius' reproaches. In order to\nextricate himself from the predicament, he took the simplest course; he\nlied abominably.\n\n\"Citizen, I delivered the letter to the porter. The lady was asleep. She\nwill have the letter when she wakes up.\"\n\nMarius had had two objects in sending that letter: to bid farewell to\nCosette and to save Gavroche. He was obliged to content himself with the\nhalf of his desire.\n\nThe despatch of his letter and the presence of M. Fauchelevent in the\nbarricade, was a coincidence which occurred to him. He pointed out M.\nFauchelevent to Gavroche.\n\n\"Do you know that man?\"\n\n\"No,\" said Gavroche.\n\nGavroche had, in fact, as we have just mentioned, seen Jean Valjean only\nat night.\n\nThe troubled and unhealthy conjectures which had outlined themselves in\nMarius' mind were dissipated. Did he know M. Fauchelevent's opinions?\nPerhaps M. Fauchelevent was a republican. Hence his very natural\npresence in this combat.\n\nIn the meanwhile, Gavroche was shouting, at the other end of the\nbarricade: \"My gun!\"\n\nCourfeyrac had it returned to him.\n\nGavroche warned \"his comrades\" as he called them, that the barricade was\nblocked. He had had great difficulty in reaching it. A battalion of the\nline whose arms were piled in the Rue de la Petite Truanderie was on\nthe watch on the side of the Rue du Cygne; on the opposite side, the\nmunicipal guard occupied the Rue des Precheurs. The bulk of the army was\nfacing them in front.\n\nThis information given, Gavroche added:\n\n\"I authorize you to hit 'em a tremendous whack.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Enjolras was straining his ears and watching at his\nembrasure.\n\nThe assailants, dissatisfied, no doubt, with their shot, had not\nrepeated it.\n\nA company of infantry of the line had come up and occupied the end of\nthe street behind the piece of ordnance. The soldiers were tearing up\nthe pavement and constructing with the stones a small, low wall, a\nsort of side-work not more than eighteen inches high, and facing the\nbarricade. In the angle at the left of this epaulement, there was\nvisible the head of the column of a battalion from the suburbs massed in\nthe Rue Saint-Denis.\n\nEnjolras, on the watch, thought he distinguished the peculiar sound\nwhich is produced when the shells of grape-shot are drawn from the\ncaissons, and he saw the commander of the piece change the elevation\nand incline the mouth of the cannon slightly to the left. Then the\ncannoneers began to load the piece. The chief seized the lint-stock\nhimself and lowered it to the vent.\n\n\"Down with your heads, hug the wall!\" shouted Enjolras, \"and all on your\nknees along the barricade!\"\n\nThe insurgents who were straggling in front of the wine-shop, and\nwho had quitted their posts of combat on Gavroche's arrival, rushed\npell-mell towards the barricade; but before Enjolras' order could be\nexecuted, the discharge took place with the terrifying rattle of a round\nof grape-shot. This is what it was, in fact.\n\nThe charge had been aimed at the cut in the redoubt, and had there\nrebounded from the wall; and this terrible rebound had produced two dead\nand three wounded.\n\nIf this were continued, the barricade was no longer tenable. The\ngrape-shot made its way in.\n\nA murmur of consternation arose.\n\n\"Let us prevent the second discharge,\" said Enjolras.\n\nAnd, lowering his rifle, he took aim at the captain of the gun, who, at\nthat moment, was bearing down on the breach of his gun and rectifying\nand definitely fixing its pointing.\n\nThe captain of the piece was a handsome sergeant of artillery, very\nyoung, blond, with a very gentle face, and the intelligent air peculiar\nto that predestined and redoubtable weapon which, by dint of perfecting\nitself in horror, must end in killing war.\n\nCombeferre, who was standing beside Enjolras, scrutinized this young\nman.\n\n\"What a pity!\" said Combeferre. \"What hideous things these butcheries\nare! Come, when there are no more kings, there will be no more war.\nEnjolras, you are taking aim at that sergeant, you are not looking at\nhim. Fancy, he is a charming young man; he is intrepid; it is evident\nthat he is thoughtful; those young artillery-men are very well educated;\nhe has a father, a mother, a family; he is probably in love; he is not\nmore than five and twenty at the most; he might be your brother.\"\n\n\"He is,\" said Enjolras.\n\n\"Yes,\" replied Combeferre, \"he is mine too. Well, let us not kill him.\"\n\n\"Let me alone. It must be done.\"\n\nAnd a tear trickled slowly down Enjolras' marble cheek.\n\nAt the same moment, he pressed the trigger of his rifle. The flame\nleaped forth. The artillery-man turned round twice, his arms extended in\nfront of him, his head uplifted, as though for breath, then he fell with\nhis side on the gun, and lay there motionless. They could see his back,\nfrom the centre of which there flowed directly a stream of blood. The\nball had traversed his breast from side to side. He was dead.\n\nHe had to be carried away and replaced by another. Several minutes were\nthus gained, in fact.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX--EMPLOYMENT OF THE OLD TALENTS OF A POACHER AND THAT\nINFALLIBLE MARKSMANSHIP WHICH INFLUENCED THE CONDEMNATION OF 1796\n\nOpinions were exchanged in the barricade. The firing from the gun was\nabout to begin again. Against that grape-shot, they could not hold out\na quarter of an hour longer. It was absolutely necessary to deaden the\nblows.\n\nEnjolras issued this command:\n\n\"We must place a mattress there.\"\n\n\"We have none,\" said Combeferre, \"the wounded are lying on them.\"\n\nJean Valjean, who was seated apart on a stone post, at the corner of the\ntavern, with his gun between his knees, had, up to that moment, taken\nno part in anything that was going on. He did not appear to hear the\ncombatants saying around him: \"Here is a gun that is doing nothing.\"\n\nAt the order issued by Enjolras, he rose.\n\nIt will be remembered that, on the arrival of the rabble in the Rue\nde la Chanvrerie, an old woman, foreseeing the bullets, had placed her\nmattress in front of her window. This window, an attic window, was on\nthe roof of a six-story house situated a little beyond the barricade.\nThe mattress, placed cross-wise, supported at the bottom on two poles\nfor drying linen, was upheld at the top by two ropes, which, at that\ndistance, looked like two threads, and which were attached to two nails\nplanted in the window frames. These ropes were distinctly visible, like\nhairs, against the sky.\n\n\"Can some one lend me a double-barrelled rifle?\" said Jean Valjean.\n\nEnjolras, who had just re-loaded his, handed it to him.\n\nJean Valjean took aim at the attic window and fired.\n\nOne of the mattress ropes was cut.\n\nThe mattress now hung by one thread only.\n\nJean Valjean fired the second charge. The second rope lashed the panes\nof the attic window. The mattress slipped between the two poles and fell\ninto the street.\n\nThe barricade applauded.\n\nAll voices cried:\n\n\"Here is a mattress!\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Combeferre, \"but who will go and fetch it?\"\n\nThe mattress had, in fact, fallen outside the barricade, between\nbesiegers and besieged. Now, the death of the sergeant of artillery\nhaving exasperated the troop, the soldiers had, for several minutes,\nbeen lying flat on their stomachs behind the line of paving-stones which\nthey had erected, and, in order to supply the forced silence of\nthe piece, which was quiet while its service was in course of\nreorganization, they had opened fire on the barricade. The insurgents\ndid not reply to this musketry, in order to spare their ammunition The\nfusillade broke against the barricade; but the street, which it filled,\nwas terrible.\n\nJean Valjean stepped out of the cut, entered the street, traversed the\nstorm of bullets, walked up to the mattress, hoisted it upon his back,\nand returned to the barricade.\n\nHe placed the mattress in the cut with his own hands. He fixed it there\nagainst the wall in such a manner that the artillery-men should not see\nit.\n\nThat done, they awaited the next discharge of grape-shot.\n\nIt was not long in coming.\n\nThe cannon vomited forth its package of buck-shot with a roar. But there\nwas no rebound. The effect which they had foreseen had been attained.\nThe barricade was saved.\n\n\"Citizen,\" said Enjolras to Jean Valjean, \"the Republic thanks you.\"\n\nBossuet admired and laughed. He exclaimed:\n\n\"It is immoral that a mattress should have so much power. Triumph of\nthat which yields over that which strikes with lightning. But never\nmind, glory to the mattress which annuls a cannon!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X--DAWN\n\nAt that moment, Cosette awoke.\n\nHer chamber was narrow, neat, unobtrusive, with a long sash-window,\nfacing the East on the back court-yard of the house.\n\nCosette knew nothing of what was going on in Paris. She had not been\nthere on the preceding evening, and she had already retired to her\nchamber when Toussaint had said:\n\n\"It appears that there is a row.\"\n\nCosette had slept only a few hours, but soundly. She had had sweet\ndreams, which possibly arose from the fact that her little bed was very\nwhite. Some one, who was Marius, had appeared to her in the light. She\nawoke with the sun in her eyes, which, at first, produced on her the\neffect of being a continuation of her dream. Her first thought on\nemerging from this dream was a smiling one. Cosette felt herself\nthoroughly reassured. Like Jean Valjean, she had, a few hours\npreviously, passed through that reaction of the soul which absolutely\nwill not hear of unhappiness. She began to cherish hope, with all her\nmight, without knowing why. Then she felt a pang at her heart. It was\nthree days since she had seen Marius. But she said to herself that he\nmust have received her letter, that he knew where she was, and that\nhe was so clever that he would find means of reaching her.--And that\ncertainly to-day, and perhaps that very morning.--It was broad daylight,\nbut the rays of light were very horizontal; she thought that it was very\nearly, but that she must rise, nevertheless, in order to receive Marius.\n\nShe felt that she could not live without Marius, and that, consequently,\nthat was sufficient and that Marius would come. No objection was valid.\nAll this was certain. It was monstrous enough already to have suffered\nfor three days. Marius absent three days, this was horrible on the part\nof the good God. Now, this cruel teasing from on high had been gone\nthrough with. Marius was about to arrive, and he would bring good news.\nYouth is made thus; it quickly dries its eyes; it finds sorrow useless\nand does not accept it. Youth is the smile of the future in the presence\nof an unknown quantity, which is itself. It is natural to it to be\nhappy. It seems as though its respiration were made of hope.\n\nMoreover, Cosette could not remember what Marius had said to her on\nthe subject of this absence which was to last only one day, and what\nexplanation of it he had given her. Every one has noticed with what\nnimbleness a coin which one has dropped on the ground rolls away and\nhides, and with what art it renders itself undiscoverable. There are\nthoughts which play us the same trick; they nestle away in a corner of\nour brain; that is the end of them; they are lost; it is impossible to\nlay the memory on them. Cosette was somewhat vexed at the useless little\neffort made by her memory. She told herself, that it was very naughty\nand very wicked of her, to have forgotten the words uttered by Marius.\n\nShe sprang out of bed and accomplished the two ablutions of soul and\nbody, her prayers and her toilet.\n\nOne may, in a case of exigency, introduce the reader into a nuptial\nchamber, not into a virginal chamber. Verse would hardly venture it,\nprose must not.\n\nIt is the interior of a flower that is not yet unfolded, it is whiteness\nin the dark, it is the private cell of a closed lily, which must not be\ngazed upon by man so long as the sun has not gazed upon it. Woman in the\nbud is sacred. That innocent bud which opens, that adorable half-nudity\nwhich is afraid of itself, that white foot which takes refuge in a\nslipper, that throat which veils itself before a mirror as though\na mirror were an eye, that chemise which makes haste to rise up and\nconceal the shoulder for a creaking bit of furniture or a passing\nvehicle, those cords tied, those clasps fastened, those laces drawn,\nthose tremors, those shivers of cold and modesty, that exquisite\naffright in every movement, that almost winged uneasiness where there\nis no cause for alarm, the successive phases of dressing, as charming as\nthe clouds of dawn,--it is not fitting that all this should be narrated,\nand it is too much to have even called attention to it.\n\nThe eye of man must be more religious in the presence of the rising of a\nyoung girl than in the presence of the rising of a star. The possibility\nof hurting should inspire an augmentation of respect. The down on the\npeach, the bloom on the plum, the radiated crystal of the snow, the wing\nof the butterfly powdered with feathers, are coarse compared to that\nchastity which does not even know that it is chaste. The young girl is\nonly the flash of a dream, and is not yet a statue. Her bed-chamber is\nhidden in the sombre part of the ideal. The indiscreet touch of a glance\nbrutalizes this vague penumbra. Here, contemplation is profanation.\n\nWe shall, therefore, show nothing of that sweet little flutter of\nCosette's rising.\n\nAn oriental tale relates how the rose was made white by God, but that\nAdam looked upon her when she was unfolding, and she was ashamed and\nturned crimson. We are of the number who fall speechless in the presence\nof young girls and flowers, since we think them worthy of veneration.\n\nCosette dressed herself very hastily, combed and dressed her hair, which\nwas a very simple matter in those days, when women did not swell out\ntheir curls and bands with cushions and puffs, and did not put crinoline\nin their locks. Then she opened the window and cast her eyes around her\nin every direction, hoping to descry some bit of the street, an angle of\nthe house, an edge of pavement, so that she might be able to watch for\nMarius there. But no view of the outside was to be had. The back court\nwas surrounded by tolerably high walls, and the outlook was only on\nseveral gardens. Cosette pronounced these gardens hideous: for the first\ntime in her life, she found flowers ugly. The smallest scrap of the\ngutter of the street would have met her wishes better. She decided to\ngaze at the sky, as though she thought that Marius might come from that\nquarter.\n\nAll at once, she burst into tears. Not that this was fickleness of\nsoul; but hopes cut in twain by dejection--that was her case. She had a\nconfused consciousness of something horrible. Thoughts were rife in the\nair, in fact. She told herself that she was not sure of anything, that\nto withdraw herself from sight was to be lost; and the idea that Marius\ncould return to her from heaven appeared to her no longer charming but\nmournful.\n\nThen, as is the nature of these clouds, calm returned to her, and hope\nand a sort of unconscious smile, which yet indicated trust in God.\n\nEvery one in the house was still asleep. A country-like silence reigned.\nNot a shutter had been opened. The porter's lodge was closed. Toussaint\nhad not risen, and Cosette, naturally, thought that her father was\nasleep. She must have suffered much, and she must have still been\nsuffering greatly, for she said to herself, that her father had been\nunkind; but she counted on Marius. The eclipse of such a light was\ndecidedly impossible. Now and then, she heard sharp shocks in the\ndistance, and she said: \"It is odd that people should be opening and\nshutting their carriage gates so early.\" They were the reports of the\ncannon battering the barricade.\n\nA few feet below Cosette's window, in the ancient and perfectly black\ncornice of the wall, there was a martin's nest; the curve of this nest\nformed a little projection beyond the cornice, so that from above it\nwas possible to look into this little paradise. The mother was there,\nspreading her wings like a fan over her brood; the father fluttered\nabout, flew away, then came back, bearing in his beak food and kisses.\nThe dawning day gilded this happy thing, the great law, \"Multiply,\" lay\nthere smiling and august, and that sweet mystery unfolded in the\nglory of the morning. Cosette, with her hair in the sunlight, her\nsoul absorbed in chimeras, illuminated by love within and by the dawn\nwithout, bent over mechanically, and almost without daring to avow to\nherself that she was thinking at the same time of Marius, began to gaze\nat these birds, at this family, at that male and female, that mother and\nher little ones, with the profound trouble which a nest produces on a\nvirgin.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI--THE SHOT WHICH MISSES NOTHING AND KILLS NO ONE\n\nThe assailants' fire continued. Musketry and grape-shot alternated, but\nwithout committing great ravages, to tell the truth. The top alone of\nthe Corinthe facade suffered; the window on the first floor, and the\nattic window in the roof, riddled with buck-shot and biscaiens, were\nslowly losing their shape. The combatants who had been posted there had\nbeen obliged to withdraw. However, this is according to the tactics\nof barricades; to fire for a long while, in order to exhaust the\ninsurgents' ammunition, if they commit the mistake of replying. When it\nis perceived, from the slackening of their fire, that they have no more\npowder and ball, the assault is made. Enjolras had not fallen into this\ntrap; the barricade did not reply.\n\nAt every discharge by platoons, Gavroche puffed out his cheek with his\ntongue, a sign of supreme disdain.\n\n\"Good for you,\" said he, \"rip up the cloth. We want some lint.\"\n\nCourfeyrac called the grape-shot to order for the little effect which it\nproduced, and said to the cannon:\n\n\"You are growing diffuse, my good fellow.\"\n\nOne gets puzzled in battle, as at a ball. It is probable that this\nsilence on the part of the redoubt began to render the besiegers uneasy,\nand to make them fear some unexpected incident, and that they felt the\nnecessity of getting a clear view behind that heap of paving-stones, and\nof knowing what was going on behind that impassable wall which received\nblows without retorting. The insurgents suddenly perceived a helmet\nglittering in the sun on a neighboring roof. A fireman had placed his\nback against a tall chimney, and seemed to be acting as sentinel. His\nglance fell directly down into the barricade.\n\n\"There's an embarrassing watcher,\" said Enjolras.\n\nJean Valjean had returned Enjolras' rifle, but he had his own gun.\n\nWithout saying a word, he took aim at the fireman, and, a second later,\nthe helmet, smashed by a bullet, rattled noisily into the street. The\nterrified soldier made haste to disappear. A second observer took his\nplace. This one was an officer. Jean Valjean, who had re-loaded his\ngun, took aim at the newcomer and sent the officer's casque to join the\nsoldier's. The officer did not persist, and retired speedily. This time\nthe warning was understood. No one made his appearance thereafter on\nthat roof; and the idea of spying on the barricade was abandoned.\n\n\"Why did you not kill the man?\" Bossuet asked Jean Valjean.\n\nJean Valjean made no reply.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII--DISORDER A PARTISAN OF ORDER\n\nBossuet muttered in Combeferre's ear:\n\n\"He did not answer my question.\"\n\n\"He is a man who does good by gun-shots,\" said Combeferre.\n\nThose who have preserved some memory of this already distant epoch\nknow that the National Guard from the suburbs was valiant against\ninsurrections. It was particularly zealous and intrepid in the days of\nJune, 1832. A certain good dram-shop keeper of Pantin des Vertus or\nla Cunette, whose \"establishment\" had been closed by the riots, became\nleonine at the sight of his deserted dance-hall, and got himself killed\nto preserve the order represented by a tea-garden. In that bourgeois and\nheroic time, in the presence of ideas which had their knights, interests\nhad their paladins. The prosiness of the originators detracted nothing\nfrom the bravery of the movement. The diminution of a pile of crowns\nmade bankers sing the Marseillaise. They shed their blood lyrically for\nthe counting-house; and they defended the shop, that immense diminutive\nof the fatherland, with Lacedaemonian enthusiasm.\n\nAt bottom, we will observe, there was nothing in all this that was not\nextremely serious. It was social elements entering into strife, while\nawaiting the day when they should enter into equilibrium.\n\nAnother sign of the times was the anarchy mingled with governmentalism\n[the barbarous name of the correct party]. People were for order in\ncombination with lack of discipline.\n\nThe drum suddenly beat capricious calls, at the command of such or\nsuch a Colonel of the National Guard; such and such a captain went into\naction through inspiration; such and such National Guardsmen fought,\n\"for an idea,\" and on their own account. At critical moments, on \"days\"\nthey took counsel less of their leaders than of their instincts. There\nexisted in the army of order, veritable guerilleros, some of the sword,\nlike Fannicot, others of the pen, like Henri Fonfrede.\n\nCivilization, unfortunately, represented at this epoch rather by an\naggregation of interests than by a group of principles, was or thought\nitself, in peril; it set up the cry of alarm; each, constituting himself\na centre, defended it, succored it, and protected it with his own head;\nand the first comer took it upon himself to save society.\n\nZeal sometimes proceeded to extermination. A platoon of the National\nGuard would constitute itself on its own authority a private council of\nwar, and judge and execute a captured insurgent in five minutes. It\nwas an improvisation of this sort that had slain Jean Prouvaire. Fierce\nLynch law, with which no one party had any right to reproach the rest,\nfor it has been applied by the Republic in America, as well as by the\nmonarchy in Europe. This Lynch law was complicated with mistakes. On one\nday of rioting, a young poet, named Paul Aime Garnier, was pursued\nin the Place Royale, with a bayonet at his loins, and only escaped by\ntaking refuge under the porte-cochere of No. 6. They shouted:--\"There's\nanother of those Saint-Simonians!\" and they wanted to kill him. Now, he\nhad under his arm a volume of the memoirs of the Duc de Saint-Simon.\nA National Guard had read the words Saint-Simon on the book, and had\nshouted: \"Death!\"\n\nOn the 6th of June, 1832, a company of the National Guards from the\nsuburbs, commanded by the Captain Fannicot, above mentioned, had itself\ndecimated in the Rue de la Chanvrerie out of caprice and its own good\npleasure. This fact, singular though it may seem, was proved at the\njudicial investigation opened in consequence of the insurrection of\n1832. Captain Fannicot, a bold and impatient bourgeois, a sort of\ncondottiere of the order of those whom we have just characterized,\na fanatical and intractable governmentalist, could not resist the\ntemptation to fire prematurely, and the ambition of capturing the\nbarricade alone and unaided, that is to say, with his company.\nExasperated by the successive apparition of the red flag and the old\ncoat which he took for the black flag, he loudly blamed the generals and\nchiefs of the corps, who were holding council and did not think that the\nmoment for the decisive assault had arrived, and who were allowing \"the\ninsurrection to fry in its own fat,\" to use the celebrated expression\nof one of them. For his part, he thought the barricade ripe, and as that\nwhich is ripe ought to fall, he made the attempt.\n\nHe commanded men as resolute as himself, \"raging fellows,\" as a witness\nsaid. His company, the same which had shot Jean Prouvaire the poet, was\nthe first of the battalion posted at the angle of the street. At the\nmoment when they were least expecting it, the captain launched his men\nagainst the barricade. This movement, executed with more good will than\nstrategy, cost the Fannicot company dear. Before it had traversed two\nthirds of the street it was received by a general discharge from the\nbarricade. Four, the most audacious, who were running on in front,\nwere mown down point-blank at the very foot of the redoubt, and this\ncourageous throng of National Guards, very brave men but lacking in\nmilitary tenacity, were forced to fall back, after some hesitation,\nleaving fifteen corpses on the pavement. This momentary hesitation gave\nthe insurgents time to re-load their weapons, and a second and very\ndestructive discharge struck the company before it could regain the\ncorner of the street, its shelter. A moment more, and it was caught\nbetween two fires, and it received the volley from the battery piece\nwhich, not having received the order, had not discontinued its firing.\n\nThe intrepid and imprudent Fannicot was one of the dead from this\ngrape-shot. He was killed by the cannon, that is to say, by order.\n\nThis attack, which was more furious than serious, irritated\nEnjolras.--\"The fools!\" said he. \"They are getting their own men killed\nand they are using up our ammunition for nothing.\"\n\nEnjolras spoke like the real general of insurrection which he\nwas. Insurrection and repression do not fight with equal weapons.\nInsurrection, which is speedily exhausted, has only a certain number\nof shots to fire and a certain number of combatants to expend. An empty\ncartridge-box, a man killed, cannot be replaced. As repression has the\narmy, it does not count its men, and, as it has Vincennes, it does not\ncount its shots. Repression has as many regiments as the barricade has\nmen, and as many arsenals as the barricade has cartridge-boxes. Thus\nthey are struggles of one against a hundred, which always end in\ncrushing the barricade; unless the revolution, uprising suddenly,\nflings into the balance its flaming archangel's sword. This does happen\nsometimes. Then everything rises, the pavements begin to seethe, popular\nredoubts abound. Paris quivers supremely, the quid divinum is given\nforth, a 10th of August is in the air, a 29th of July is in the air, a\nwonderful light appears, the yawning maw of force draws back, and the\narmy, that lion, sees before it, erect and tranquil, that prophet,\nFrance.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII--PASSING GLEAMS\n\nIn the chaos of sentiments and passions which defend a barricade, there\nis a little of everything; there is bravery, there is youth, honor,\nenthusiasm, the ideal, conviction, the rage of the gambler, and, above\nall, intermittences of hope.\n\nOne of these intermittences, one of these vague quivers of hope suddenly\ntraversed the barricade of the Rue de la Chanvrerie at the moment when\nit was least expected.\n\n\"Listen,\" suddenly cried Enjolras, who was still on the watch, \"it seems\nto me that Paris is waking up.\"\n\nIt is certain that, on the morning of the 6th of June, the insurrection\nbroke out afresh for an hour or two, to a certain extent. The obstinacy\nof the alarm peal of Saint-Merry reanimated some fancies. Barricades\nwere begun in the Rue du Poirier and the Rue des Gravilliers. In front\nof the Porte Saint-Martin, a young man, armed with a rifle, attacked\nalone a squadron of cavalry. In plain sight, on the open boulevard, he\nplaced one knee on the ground, shouldered his weapon, fired, killed the\ncommander of the squadron, and turned away, saying: \"There's another who\nwill do us no more harm.\"\n\nHe was put to the sword. In the Rue Saint-Denis, a woman fired on the\nNational Guard from behind a lowered blind. The slats of the blind could\nbe seen to tremble at every shot. A child fourteen years of age\nwas arrested in the Rue de la Cossonerie, with his pockets full of\ncartridges. Many posts were attacked. At the entrance to the Rue\nBertin-Poiree, a very lively and utterly unexpected fusillade welcomed\na regiment of cuirrassiers, at whose head marched Marshal General\nCavaignac de Barague. In the Rue Planche-Mibray, they threw old pieces\nof pottery and household utensils down on the soldiers from the roofs; a\nbad sign; and when this matter was reported to Marshal Soult, Napoleon's\nold lieutenant grew thoughtful, as he recalled Suchet's saying at\nSaragossa: \"We are lost when the old women empty their pots de chambre\non our heads.\"\n\nThese general symptoms which presented themselves at the moment when\nit was thought that the uprising had been rendered local, this fever\nof wrath, these sparks which flew hither and thither above those deep\nmasses of combustibles which are called the faubourgs of Paris,--all\nthis, taken together, disturbed the military chiefs. They made haste to\nstamp out these beginnings of conflagration.\n\nThey delayed the attack on the barricades Maubuee, de la Chanvrerie and\nSaint-Merry until these sparks had been extinguished, in order that they\nmight have to deal with the barricades only and be able to finish\nthem at one blow. Columns were thrown into the streets where there was\nfermentation, sweeping the large, sounding the small, right and left,\nnow slowly and cautiously, now at full charge. The troops broke in\nthe doors of houses whence shots had been fired; at the same time,\nmanoeuvres by the cavalry dispersed the groups on the boulevards. This\nrepression was not effected without some commotion, and without that\ntumultuous uproar peculiar to collisions between the army and the\npeople. This was what Enjolras had caught in the intervals of the\ncannonade and the musketry. Moreover, he had seen wounded men passing\nthe end of the street in litters, and he said to Courfeyrac:--\"Those\nwounded do not come from us.\"\n\nTheir hope did not last long; the gleam was quickly eclipsed. In less\nthan half an hour, what was in the air vanished, it was a flash of\nlightning unaccompanied by thunder, and the insurgents felt that sort of\nleaden cope, which the indifference of the people casts over obstinate\nand deserted men, fall over them once more.\n\nThe general movement, which seemed to have assumed a vague outline, had\nmiscarried; and the attention of the minister of war and the strategy of\nthe generals could now be concentrated on the three or four barricades\nwhich still remained standing.\n\nThe sun was mounting above the horizon.\n\nAn insurgent hailed Enjolras.\n\n\"We are hungry here. Are we really going to die like this, without\nanything to eat?\"\n\nEnjolras, who was still leaning on his elbows at his embrasure, made an\naffirmative sign with his head, but without taking his eyes from the end\nof the street.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV--WHEREIN WILL APPEAR THE NAME OF ENJOLRAS' MISTRESS\n\nCourfeyrac, seated on a paving-stone beside Enjolras, continued to\ninsult the cannon, and each time that that gloomy cloud of projectiles\nwhich is called grape-shot passed overhead with its terrible sound he\nassailed it with a burst of irony.\n\n\"You are wearing out your lungs, poor, brutal, old fellow, you pain me,\nyou are wasting your row. That's not thunder, it's a cough.\"\n\nAnd the bystanders laughed.\n\nCourfeyrac and Bossuet, whose brave good humor increased with the peril,\nlike Madame Scarron, replaced nourishment with pleasantry, and, as wine\nwas lacking, they poured out gayety to all.\n\n\"I admire Enjolras,\" said Bossuet. \"His impassive temerity astounds\nme. He lives alone, which renders him a little sad, perhaps; Enjolras\ncomplains of his greatness, which binds him to widowhood. The rest of us\nhave mistresses, more or less, who make us crazy, that is to say, brave.\nWhen a man is as much in love as a tiger, the least that he can do is to\nfight like a lion. That is one way of taking our revenge for the capers\nthat mesdames our grisettes play on us. Roland gets himself killed for\nAngelique; all our heroism comes from our women. A man without a woman\nis a pistol without a trigger; it is the woman that sets the man off.\nWell, Enjolras has no woman. He is not in love, and yet he manages to be\nintrepid. It is a thing unheard of that a man should be as cold as ice\nand as bold as fire.\"\n\nEnjolras did not appear to be listening, but had any one been near him,\nthat person would have heard him mutter in a low voice: \"Patria.\"\n\nBossuet was still laughing when Courfeyrac exclaimed:\n\n\"News!\"\n\nAnd assuming the tone of an usher making an announcement, he added:\n\n\"My name is Eight-Pounder.\"\n\nIn fact, a new personage had entered on the scene. This was a second\npiece of ordnance.\n\nThe artillery-men rapidly performed their manoeuvres in force and placed\nthis second piece in line with the first.\n\nThis outlined the catastrophe.\n\nA few minutes later, the two pieces, rapidly served, were firing\npoint-blank at the redoubt; the platoon firing of the line and of the\nsoldiers from the suburbs sustained the artillery.\n\nAnother cannonade was audible at some distance. At the same time that\nthe two guns were furiously attacking the redoubt from the Rue de la\nChanvrerie, two other cannons, trained one from the Rue Saint-Denis,\nthe other from the Rue Aubry-le-Boucher, were riddling the Saint-Merry\nbarricade. The four cannons echoed each other mournfully.\n\nThe barking of these sombre dogs of war replied to each other.\n\nOne of the two pieces which was now battering the barricade on the Rue\nde la Chanvrerie was firing grape-shot, the other balls.\n\nThe piece which was firing balls was pointed a little high, and the aim\nwas calculated so that the ball struck the extreme edge of the upper\ncrest of the barricade, and crumbled the stone down upon the insurgents,\nmingled with bursts of grape-shot.\n\nThe object of this mode of firing was to drive the insurgents from\nthe summit of the redoubt, and to compel them to gather close in the\ninterior, that is to say, this announced the assault.\n\nThe combatants once driven from the crest of the barricade by balls,\nand from the windows of the cabaret by grape-shot, the attacking columns\ncould venture into the street without being picked off, perhaps, even,\nwithout being seen, could briskly and suddenly scale the redoubt, as on\nthe preceding evening, and, who knows? take it by surprise.\n\n\"It is absolutely necessary that the inconvenience of those guns\nshould be diminished,\" said Enjolras, and he shouted: \"Fire on the\nartillery-men!\"\n\nAll were ready. The barricade, which had long been silent, poured forth\na desperate fire; seven or eight discharges followed, with a sort of\nrage and joy; the street was filled with blinding smoke, and, at the end\nof a few minutes, athwart this mist all streaked with flame, two thirds\nof the gunners could be distinguished lying beneath the wheels of the\ncannons. Those who were left standing continued to serve the pieces with\nsevere tranquillity, but the fire had slackened.\n\n\"Things are going well now,\" said Bossuet to Enjolras. \"Success.\"\n\nEnjolras shook his head and replied:\n\n\"Another quarter of an hour of this success, and there will not be any\ncartridges left in the barricade.\"\n\nIt appears that Gavroche overheard this remark.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XV--GAVROCHE OUTSIDE\n\nCourfeyrac suddenly caught sight of some one at the base of the\nbarricade, outside in the street, amid the bullets.\n\nGavroche had taken a bottle basket from the wine-shop, had made his\nway out through the cut, and was quietly engaged in emptying the full\ncartridge-boxes of the National Guardsmen who had been killed on the\nslope of the redoubt, into his basket.\n\n\"What are you doing there?\" asked Courfeyrac.\n\nGavroche raised his face:--\n\n\"I'm filling my basket, citizen.\"\n\n\"Don't you see the grape-shot?\"\n\nGavroche replied:\n\n\"Well, it is raining. What then?\"\n\nCourfeyrac shouted:--\"Come in!\"\n\n\"Instanter,\" said Gavroche.\n\nAnd with a single bound he plunged into the street.\n\nIt will be remembered that Fannicot's company had left behind it a trail\nof bodies. Twenty corpses lay scattered here and there on the pavement,\nthrough the whole length of the street. Twenty cartouches for Gavroche\nmeant a provision of cartridges for the barricade.\n\nThe smoke in the street was like a fog. Whoever has beheld a cloud which\nhas fallen into a mountain gorge between two peaked escarpments can\nimagine this smoke rendered denser and thicker by two gloomy rows of\nlofty houses. It rose gradually and was incessantly renewed; hence a\ntwilight which made even the broad daylight turn pale. The combatants\ncould hardly see each other from one end of the street to the other,\nshort as it was.\n\nThis obscurity, which had probably been desired and calculated on by the\ncommanders who were to direct the assault on the barricade, was useful\nto Gavroche.\n\nBeneath the folds of this veil of smoke, and thanks to his small size,\nhe could advance tolerably far into the street without being seen. He\nrifled the first seven or eight cartridge-boxes without much danger.\n\nHe crawled flat on his belly, galloped on all fours, took his basket\nin his teeth, twisted, glided, undulated, wound from one dead body to\nanother, and emptied the cartridge-box or cartouche as a monkey opens a\nnut.\n\nThey did not dare to shout to him to return from the barricade, which\nwas quite near, for fear of attracting attention to him.\n\nOn one body, that of a corporal, he found a powder-flask.\n\n\"For thirst,\" said he, putting it in his pocket.\n\nBy dint of advancing, he reached a point where the fog of the fusillade\nbecame transparent. So that the sharpshooters of the line ranged on\nthe outlook behind their paving-stone dike and the sharpshooters of the\nbanlieue massed at the corner of the street suddenly pointed out to each\nother something moving through the smoke.\n\nAt the moment when Gavroche was relieving a sergeant, who was lying near\na stone door-post, of his cartridges, a bullet struck the body.\n\n\"Fichtre!\" ejaculated Gavroche. \"They are killing my dead men for me.\"\n\nA second bullet struck a spark from the pavement beside him.--A third\noverturned his basket.\n\nGavroche looked and saw that this came from the men of the banlieue.\n\nHe sprang to his feet, stood erect, with his hair flying in the wind,\nhis hands on his hips, his eyes fixed on the National Guardsmen who were\nfiring, and sang:\n\n      \"On est laid a Nanterre,       \"Men are ugly at Nanterre,\n       C'est la faute a Voltaire;     'Tis the  fault of Voltaire;\n       Et bete a Palaiseau,           And dull at Palaiseau,\n       C'est la faute a Rousseau.\"    'Tis the fault of Rousseau.\"\n\n\nThen he picked up his basket, replaced the cartridges which had fallen\nfrom it, without missing a single one, and, advancing towards the\nfusillade, set about plundering another cartridge-box. There a fourth\nbullet missed him, again. Gavroche sang:\n\n       \"Je ne suis pas notaire,      \"I am not a notary,\n        C'est la faute a Voltaire;    'Tis the fault of Voltaire;\n        Je suis un petit oiseau,      I'm a little bird,\n        C'est la faute a Rousseau.\"   'Tis the fault of Rousseau.\"\n\nA fifth bullet only succeeded in drawing from him a third couplet.\n\n       \"Joie est mon caractere,      \"Joy is my character,\n        C'est la faute a Voltaire;    'Tis the fault of Voltaire;\n        Misere est mon trousseau,     Misery is my trousseau,\n        C'est la faute a Rousseau.\"   'Tis the fault of Rousseau.\"\n\n\nThus it went on for some time.\n\nIt was a charming and terrible sight. Gavroche, though shot at, was\nteasing the fusillade. He had the air of being greatly diverted. It was\nthe sparrow pecking at the sportsmen. To each discharge he retorted\nwith a couplet. They aimed at him constantly, and always missed him. The\nNational Guardsmen and the soldiers laughed as they took aim at him. He\nlay down, sprang to his feet, hid in the corner of a doorway, then made\na bound, disappeared, re-appeared, scampered away, returned, replied to\nthe grape-shot with his thumb at his nose, and, all the while, went on\npillaging the cartouches, emptying the cartridge-boxes, and filling his\nbasket. The insurgents, panting with anxiety, followed him with their\neyes. The barricade trembled; he sang. He was not a child, he was not\na man; he was a strange gamin-fairy. He might have been called the\ninvulnerable dwarf of the fray. The bullets flew after him, he was more\nnimble than they. He played a fearful game of hide and seek with death;\nevery time that the flat-nosed face of the spectre approached, the\nurchin administered to it a fillip.\n\nOne bullet, however, better aimed or more treacherous than the rest,\nfinally struck the will-o'-the-wisp of a child. Gavroche was seen to\nstagger, then he sank to the earth. The whole barricade gave vent to a\ncry; but there was something of Antaeus in that pygmy; for the gamin\nto touch the pavement is the same as for the giant to touch the earth;\nGavroche had fallen only to rise again; he remained in a sitting\nposture, a long thread of blood streaked his face, he raised both arms\nin the air, glanced in the direction whence the shot had come, and began\nto sing:\n\n\n      \"Je suis tombe par terre,     \"I have fallen to the earth,\n       C'est la faute a Voltaire;    'Tis the fault of Voltaire;\n       Le nez dans le ruisseau,      With my nose in the gutter,\n       C'est la faute a . . . \"      'Tis the fault of . . . \"\n\n\nHe did not finish. A second bullet from the same marksman stopped him\nshort. This time he fell face downward on the pavement, and moved no\nmore. This grand little soul had taken its flight.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI--HOW FROM A BROTHER ONE BECOMES A FATHER\n\nAt that same moment, in the garden of the Luxembourg,--for the gaze of\nthe drama must be everywhere present,--two children were holding each\nother by the hand. One might have been seven years old, the other five.\nThe rain having soaked them, they were walking along the paths on\nthe sunny side; the elder was leading the younger; they were pale and\nragged; they had the air of wild birds. The smaller of them said: \"I am\nvery hungry.\"\n\nThe elder, who was already somewhat of a protector, was leading his\nbrother with his left hand and in his right he carried a small stick.\n\nThey were alone in the garden. The garden was deserted, the gates had\nbeen closed by order of the police, on account of the insurrection. The\ntroops who had been bivouacking there had departed for the exigencies of\ncombat.\n\nHow did those children come there? Perhaps they had escaped from some\nguard-house which stood ajar; perhaps there was in the vicinity, at\nthe Barriere d'Enfer; or on the Esplanade de l'Observatoire, or in the\nneighboring carrefour, dominated by the pediment on which could be read:\nInvenerunt parvulum pannis involutum, some mountebank's booth from which\nthey had fled; perhaps they had, on the preceding evening, escaped the\neye of the inspectors of the garden at the hour of closing, and had\npassed the night in some one of those sentry-boxes where people read the\npapers? The fact is, they were stray lambs and they seemed free. To be\nastray and to seem free is to be lost. These poor little creatures were,\nin fact, lost.\n\nThese two children were the same over whom Gavroche had been put to\nsome trouble, as the reader will recollect. Children of the Thenardiers,\nleased out to Magnon, attributed to M. Gillenormand, and now leaves\nfallen from all these rootless branches, and swept over the ground by\nthe wind. Their clothing, which had been clean in Magnon's day, and\nwhich had served her as a prospectus with M. Gillenormand, had been\nconverted into rags.\n\nHenceforth these beings belonged to the statistics as \"Abandoned\nchildren,\" whom the police take note of, collect, mislay and find again\non the pavements of Paris.\n\nIt required the disturbance of a day like that to account for these\nmiserable little creatures being in that garden. If the superintendents\nhad caught sight of them, they would have driven such rags forth. Poor\nlittle things do not enter public gardens; still, people should reflect\nthat, as children, they have a right to flowers.\n\nThese children were there, thanks to the locked gates. They were there\ncontrary to the regulations. They had slipped into the garden and there\nthey remained. Closed gates do not dismiss the inspectors, oversight\nis supposed to continue, but it grows slack and reposes; and the\ninspectors, moved by the public anxiety and more occupied with the\noutside than the inside, no longer glanced into the garden, and had not\nseen the two delinquents.\n\nIt had rained the night before, and even a little in the morning. But\nin June, showers do not count for much. An hour after a storm, it can\nhardly be seen that the beautiful blonde day has wept. The earth, in\nsummer, is as quickly dried as the cheek of a child. At that period of\nthe solstice, the light of full noonday is, so to speak, poignant. It\ntakes everything. It applies itself to the earth, and superposes itself\nwith a sort of suction. One would say that the sun was thirsty. A shower\nis but a glass of water; a rainstorm is instantly drunk up. In the\nmorning everything was dripping, in the afternoon everything is powdered\nover.\n\nNothing is so worthy of admiration as foliage washed by the rain and\nwiped by the rays of sunlight; it is warm freshness. The gardens and\nmeadows, having water at their roots, and sun in their flowers, become\nperfuming-pans of incense, and smoke with all their odors at\nonce. Everything smiles, sings and offers itself. One feels gently\nintoxicated. The springtime is a provisional paradise, the sun helps man\nto have patience.\n\nThere are beings who demand nothing further; mortals, who, having\nthe azure of heaven, say: \"It is enough!\" dreamers absorbed in the\nwonderful, dipping into the idolatry of nature, indifferent to good and\nevil, contemplators of cosmos and radiantly forgetful of man, who do not\nunderstand how people can occupy themselves with the hunger of these,\nand the thirst of those, with the nudity of the poor in winter, with the\nlymphatic curvature of the little spinal column, with the pallet, the\nattic, the dungeon, and the rags of shivering young girls, when they\ncan dream beneath the trees; peaceful and terrible spirits they, and\npitilessly satisfied. Strange to say, the infinite suffices them. That\ngreat need of man, the finite, which admits of embrace, they ignore.\nThe finite which admits of progress and sublime toil, they do not\nthink about. The indefinite, which is born from the human and divine\ncombination of the infinite and the finite, escapes them. Provided that\nthey are face to face with immensity, they smile. Joy never, ecstasy\nforever. Their life lies in surrendering their personality in\ncontemplation. The history of humanity is for them only a detailed\nplan. All is not there; the true All remains without; what is the use\nof busying oneself over that detail, man? Man suffers, that is quite\npossible; but look at Aldebaran rising! The mother has no more milk, the\nnew-born babe is dying. I know nothing about that, but just look at this\nwonderful rosette which a slice of wood-cells of the pine presents under\nthe microscope! Compare the most beautiful Mechlin lace to that if you\ncan! These thinkers forget to love. The zodiac thrives with them to such\na point that it prevents their seeing the weeping child. God eclipses\ntheir souls. This is a family of minds which are, at once, great and\npetty. Horace was one of them; so was Goethe. La Fontaine perhaps;\nmagnificent egoists of the infinite, tranquil spectators of sorrow, who\ndo not behold Nero if the weather be fair, for whom the sun conceals the\nfuneral pile, who would look on at an execution by the guillotine in the\nsearch for an effect of light, who hear neither the cry nor the sob, nor\nthe death rattle, nor the alarm peal, for whom everything is well, since\nthere is a month of May, who, so long as there are clouds of purple\nand gold above their heads, declare themselves content, and who are\ndetermined to be happy until the radiance of the stars and the songs of\nthe birds are exhausted.\n\nThese are dark radiances. They have no suspicion that they are to be\npitied. Certainly they are so. He who does not weep does not see. They\nare to be admired and pitied, as one would both pity and admire a being\nat once night and day, without eyes beneath his lashes but with a star\non his brow.\n\nThe indifference of these thinkers, is, according to some, a superior\nphilosophy. That may be; but in this superiority there is some\ninfirmity. One may be immortal and yet limp: witness Vulcan. One may\nbe more than man and less than man. There is incomplete immensity in\nnature. Who knows whether the sun is not a blind man?\n\nBut then, what? In whom can we trust? Solem quis dicere falsum audeat?\nWho shall dare to say that the sun is false? Thus certain geniuses,\nthemselves, certain Very-Lofty mortals, man-stars, may be mistaken? That\nwhich is on high at the summit, at the crest, at the zenith, that which\nsends down so much light on the earth, sees but little, sees badly, sees\nnot at all? Is not this a desperate state of things? No. But what is\nthere, then, above the sun? The god.\n\nOn the 6th of June, 1832, about eleven o'clock in the morning, the\nLuxembourg, solitary and depopulated, was charming. The quincunxes and\nflower-beds shed forth balm and dazzling beauty into the sunlight. The\nbranches, wild with the brilliant glow of midday, seemed endeavoring\nto embrace. In the sycamores there was an uproar of linnets, sparrows\ntriumphed, woodpeckers climbed along the chestnut trees, administering\nlittle pecks on the bark. The flower-beds accepted the legitimate\nroyalty of the lilies; the most august of perfumes is that which\nemanates from whiteness. The peppery odor of the carnations was\nperceptible. The old crows of Marie de Medici were amorous in the tall\ntrees. The sun gilded, empurpled, set fire to and lighted up the tulips,\nwhich are nothing but all the varieties of flame made into flowers. All\naround the banks of tulips the bees, the sparks of these flame-flowers,\nhummed. All was grace and gayety, even the impending rain; this relapse,\nby which the lilies of the valley and the honeysuckles were destined to\nprofit, had nothing disturbing about it; the swallows indulged in the\ncharming threat of flying low. He who was there aspired to happiness;\nlife smelled good; all nature exhaled candor, help, assistance,\npaternity, caress, dawn. The thoughts which fell from heaven were as\nsweet as the tiny hand of a baby when one kisses it.\n\nThe statues under the trees, white and nude, had robes of shadow pierced\nwith light; these goddesses were all tattered with sunlight; rays hung\nfrom them on all sides. Around the great fountain, the earth was already\ndried up to the point of being burnt. There was sufficient breeze to\nraise little insurrections of dust here and there. A few yellow leaves,\nleft over from the autumn, chased each other merrily, and seemed to be\nplaying tricks on each other.\n\nThis abundance of light had something indescribably reassuring about it.\nLife, sap, heat, odors overflowed; one was conscious, beneath creation,\nof the enormous size of the source; in all these breaths permeated with\nlove, in this interchange of reverberations and reflections, in this\nmarvellous expenditure of rays, in this infinite outpouring of liquid\ngold, one felt the prodigality of the inexhaustible; and, behind this\nsplendor as behind a curtain of flame, one caught a glimpse of God, that\nmillionaire of stars.\n\nThanks to the sand, there was not a speck of mud; thanks to the rain,\nthere was not a grain of ashes. The clumps of blossoms had just been\nbathed; every sort of velvet, satin, gold and varnish, which springs\nfrom the earth in the form of flowers, was irreproachable. This\nmagnificence was cleanly. The grand silence of happy nature filled the\ngarden. A celestial silence that is compatible with a thousand sorts of\nmusic, the cooing of nests, the buzzing of swarms, the flutterings of\nthe breeze. All the harmony of the season was complete in one gracious\nwhole; the entrances and exits of spring took place in proper order; the\nlilacs ended; the jasmines began; some flowers were tardy, some insects\nin advance of their time; the van-guard of the red June butterflies\nfraternized with the rear-guard of the white butterflies of May. The\nplantain trees were getting their new skins. The breeze hollowed out\nundulations in the magnificent enormity of the chestnut-trees. It\nwas splendid. A veteran from the neighboring barracks, who was gazing\nthrough the fence, said: \"Here is the Spring presenting arms and in full\nuniform.\"\n\nAll nature was breakfasting; creation was at table; this was its hour;\nthe great blue cloth was spread in the sky, and the great green cloth\non earth; the sun lighted it all up brilliantly. God was serving\nthe universal repast. Each creature had his pasture or his mess. The\nring-dove found his hemp-seed, the chaffinch found his millet, the\ngoldfinch found chickweed, the red-breast found worms, the green finch\nfound flies, the fly found infusoriae, the bee found flowers. They ate\neach other somewhat, it is true, which is the misery of evil mixed with\ngood; but not a beast of them all had an empty stomach.\n\nThe two little abandoned creatures had arrived in the vicinity of the\ngrand fountain, and, rather bewildered by all this light, they tried to\nhide themselves, the instinct of the poor and the weak in the presence\nof even impersonal magnificence; and they kept behind the swans' hutch.\n\nHere and there, at intervals, when the wind blew, shouts, clamor, a sort\nof tumultuous death rattle, which was the firing, and dull blows, which\nwere discharges of cannon, struck the ear confusedly. Smoke hung over\nthe roofs in the direction of the Halles. A bell, which had the air of\nan appeal, was ringing in the distance.\n\nThese children did not appear to notice these noises. The little one\nrepeated from time to time: \"I am hungry.\"\n\nAlmost at the same instant with the children, another couple approached\nthe great basin. They consisted of a goodman, about fifty years of age,\nwho was leading by the hand a little fellow of six. No doubt, a father\nand his son. The little man of six had a big brioche.\n\nAt that epoch, certain houses abutting on the river, in the Rues Madame\nand d'Enfer, had keys to the Luxembourg garden, of which the lodgers\nenjoyed the use when the gates were shut, a privilege which was\nsuppressed later on. This father and son came from one of these houses,\nno doubt.\n\nThe two poor little creatures watched \"that gentleman\" approaching, and\nhid themselves a little more thoroughly.\n\nHe was a bourgeois. The same person, perhaps, whom Marius had one day\nheard, through his love fever, near the same grand basin, counselling\nhis son \"to avoid excesses.\" He had an affable and haughty air, and a\nmouth which was always smiling, since it did not shut. This mechanical\nsmile, produced by too much jaw and too little skin, shows the teeth\nrather than the soul. The child, with his brioche, which he had bitten\ninto but had not finished eating, seemed satiated. The child was dressed\nas a National Guardsman, owing to the insurrection, and the father had\nremained clad as a bourgeois out of prudence.\n\nFather and son halted near the fountain where two swans were sporting.\nThis bourgeois appeared to cherish a special admiration for the swans.\nHe resembled them in this sense, that he walked like them.\n\nFor the moment, the swans were swimming, which is their principal\ntalent, and they were superb.\n\nIf the two poor little beings had listened and if they had been of an\nage to understand, they might have gathered the words of this grave man.\nThe father was saying to his son:\n\n\"The sage lives content with little. Look at me, my son. I do not love\npomp. I am never seen in clothes decked with gold lace and stones; I\nleave that false splendor to badly organized souls.\"\n\nHere the deep shouts which proceeded from the direction of the Halles\nburst out with fresh force of bell and uproar.\n\n\"What is that?\" inquired the child.\n\nThe father replied:\n\n\"It is the Saturnalia.\"\n\nAll at once, he caught sight of the two little ragged boys behind the\ngreen swan-hutch.\n\n\"There is the beginning,\" said he.\n\nAnd, after a pause, he added:\n\n\"Anarchy is entering this garden.\"\n\nIn the meanwhile, his son took a bite of his brioche, spit it out, and,\nsuddenly burst out crying.\n\n\"What are you crying about?\" demanded his father.\n\n\"I am not hungry any more,\" said the child.\n\nThe father's smile became more accentuated.\n\n\"One does not need to be hungry in order to eat a cake.\"\n\n\"My cake tires me. It is stale.\"\n\n\"Don't you want any more of it?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\nThe father pointed to the swans.\n\n\"Throw it to those palmipeds.\"\n\nThe child hesitated. A person may not want any more of his cake; but\nthat is no reason for giving it away.\n\nThe father went on:\n\n\"Be humane. You must have compassion on animals.\"\n\nAnd, taking the cake from his son, he flung it into the basin.\n\nThe cake fell very near the edge.\n\nThe swans were far away, in the centre of the basin, and busy with some\nprey. They had seen neither the bourgeois nor the brioche.\n\nThe bourgeois, feeling that the cake was in danger of being wasted, and\nmoved by this useless shipwreck, entered upon a telegraphic agitation,\nwhich finally attracted the attention of the swans.\n\nThey perceived something floating, steered for the edge like ships, as\nthey are, and slowly directed their course toward the brioche, with the\nstupid majesty which befits white creatures.\n\n\"The swans [cygnes] understand signs [signes],\" said the bourgeois,\ndelighted to make a jest.\n\nAt that moment, the distant tumult of the city underwent another sudden\nincrease. This time it was sinister. There are some gusts of wind which\nspeak more distinctly than others. The one which was blowing at that\nmoment brought clearly defined drum-beats, clamors, platoon firing, and\nthe dismal replies of the tocsin and the cannon. This coincided with a\nblack cloud which suddenly veiled the sun.\n\nThe swans had not yet reached the brioche.\n\n\"Let us return home,\" said the father, \"they are attacking the\nTuileries.\"\n\nHe grasped his son's hand again. Then he continued:\n\n\"From the Tuileries to the Luxembourg, there is but the distance which\nseparates Royalty from the peerage; that is not far. Shots will soon\nrain down.\"\n\nHe glanced at the cloud.\n\n\"Perhaps it is rain itself that is about to shower down; the sky\nis joining in; the younger branch is condemned. Let us return home\nquickly.\"\n\n\"I should like to see the swans eat the brioche,\" said the child.\n\nThe father replied:\n\n\"That would be imprudent.\"\n\nAnd he led his little bourgeois away.\n\nThe son, regretting the swans, turned his head back toward the basin\nuntil a corner of the quincunxes concealed it from him.\n\nIn the meanwhile, the two little waifs had approached the brioche at\nthe same time as the swans. It was floating on the water. The smaller of\nthem stared at the cake, the elder gazed after the retreating bourgeois.\n\nFather and son entered the labyrinth of walks which leads to the grand\nflight of steps near the clump of trees on the side of the Rue Madame.\n\nAs soon as they had disappeared from view, the elder child hastily\nflung himself flat on his stomach on the rounding curb of the basin, and\nclinging to it with his left hand, and leaning over the water, on the\nverge of falling in, he stretched out his right hand with his stick\ntowards the cake. The swans, perceiving the enemy, made haste, and in so\ndoing, they produced an effect of their breasts which was of service to\nthe little fisher; the water flowed back before the swans, and one of\nthese gentle concentric undulations softly floated the brioche towards\nthe child's wand. Just as the swans came up, the stick touched the cake.\nThe child gave it a brisk rap, drew in the brioche, frightened away the\nswans, seized the cake, and sprang to his feet. The cake was wet;\nbut they were hungry and thirsty. The elder broke the cake into two\nportions, a large one and a small one, took the small one for himself,\ngave the large one to his brother, and said to him:\n\n\"Ram that into your muzzle.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVII--MORTUUS PATER FILIUM MORITURUM EXPECTAT\n\nMarius dashed out of the barricade, Combeferre followed him. But he\nwas too late. Gavroche was dead. Combeferre brought back the basket of\ncartridges; Marius bore the child.\n\n\"Alas!\" he thought, \"that which the father had done for his father, he\nwas requiting to the son; only, Thenardier had brought back his father\nalive; he was bringing back the child dead.\"\n\nWhen Marius re-entered the redoubt with Gavroche in his arms, his face,\nlike the child, was inundated with blood.\n\nAt the moment when he had stooped to lift Gavroche, a bullet had grazed\nhis head; he had not noticed it.\n\nCourfeyrac untied his cravat and with it bandaged Marius' brow.\n\nThey laid Gavroche on the same table with Mabeuf, and spread over the\ntwo corpses the black shawl. There was enough of it for both the old man\nand the child.\n\nCombeferre distributed the cartridges from the basket which he had\nbrought in.\n\nThis gave each man fifteen rounds to fire.\n\nJean Valjean was still in the same place, motionless on his stone post.\nWhen Combeferre offered him his fifteen cartridges, he shook his head.\n\n\"Here's a rare eccentric,\" said Combeferre in a low voice to Enjolras.\n\"He finds a way of not fighting in this barricade.\"\n\n\"Which does not prevent him from defending it,\" responded Enjolras.\n\n\"Heroism has its originals,\" resumed Combeferre.\n\nAnd Courfeyrac, who had overheard, added:\n\n\"He is another sort from Father Mabeuf.\"\n\nOne thing which must be noted is, that the fire which was battering the\nbarricade hardly disturbed the interior. Those who have never traversed\nthe whirlwind of this sort of war can form no idea of the singular\nmoments of tranquillity mingled with these convulsions. Men go and\ncome, they talk, they jest, they lounge. Some one whom we know heard a\ncombatant say to him in the midst of the grape-shot: \"We are here as\nat a bachelor breakfast.\" The redoubt of the Rue de la Chanvrerie, we\nrepeat, seemed very calm within. All mutations and all phases had been,\nor were about to be, exhausted. The position, from critical, had become\nmenacing, and, from menacing, was probably about to become desperate. In\nproportion as the situation grew gloomy, the glow of heroism empurpled\nthe barricade more and more. Enjolras, who was grave, dominated it,\nin the attitude of a young Spartan sacrificing his naked sword to the\nsombre genius, Epidotas.\n\nCombeferre, wearing an apron, was dressing the wounds: Bossuet and\nFeuilly were making cartridges with the powder-flask picked up by\nGavroche on the dead corporal, and Bossuet said to Feuilly: \"We are soon\nto take the diligence for another planet\"; Courfeyrac was disposing and\narranging on some paving-stones which he had reserved for himself near\nEnjolras, a complete arsenal, his sword-cane, his gun, two holster\npistols, and a cudgel, with the care of a young girl setting a small\ndunkerque in order. Jean Valjean stared silently at the wall opposite\nhim. An artisan was fastening Mother Hucheloup's big straw hat on his\nhead with a string, \"for fear of sun-stroke,\" as he said. The young\nmen from the Cougourde d'Aix were chatting merrily among themselves,\nas though eager to speak patois for the last time. Joly, who had taken\nWidow Hucheloup's mirror from the wall, was examining his tongue in it.\nSome combatants, having discovered a few crusts of rather mouldy bread,\nin a drawer, were eagerly devouring them. Marius was disturbed with\nregard to what his father was about to say to him.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVIII--THE VULTURE BECOME PREY\n\nWe must insist upon one psychological fact peculiar to barricades.\nNothing which is characteristic of that surprising war of the streets\nshould be omitted.\n\nWhatever may have been the singular inward tranquillity which we have\njust mentioned, the barricade, for those who are inside it, remains,\nnone the less, a vision.\n\nThere is something of the apocalypse in civil war, all the mists of the\nunknown are commingled with fierce flashes, revolutions are sphinxes,\nand any one who has passed through a barricade thinks he has traversed a\ndream.\n\nThe feelings to which one is subject in these places we have pointed out\nin the case of Marius, and we shall see the consequences; they are both\nmore and less than life. On emerging from a barricade, one no longer\nknows what one has seen there. One has been terrible, but one knows\nit not. One has been surrounded with conflicting ideas which had human\nfaces; one's head has been in the light of the future. There were\ncorpses lying prone there, and phantoms standing erect. The hours were\ncolossal and seemed hours of eternity. One has lived in death. Shadows\nhave passed by. What were they?\n\nOne has beheld hands on which there was blood; there was a deafening\nhorror; there was also a frightful silence; there were open mouths which\nshouted, and other open mouths which held their peace; one was in the\nmidst of smoke, of night, perhaps. One fancied that one had touched the\nsinister ooze of unknown depths; one stares at something red on one's\nfinger nails. One no longer remembers anything.\n\nLet us return to the Rue de la Chanvrerie.\n\nAll at once, between two discharges, the distant sound of a clock\nstriking the hour became audible.\n\n\"It is midday,\" said Combeferre.\n\nThe twelve strokes had not finished striking when Enjolras sprang to his\nfeet, and from the summit of the barricade hurled this thundering shout:\n\n\"Carry stones up into the houses; line the windowsills and the\nroofs with them. Half the men to their guns, the other half to the\npaving-stones. There is not a minute to be lost.\"\n\nA squad of sappers and miners, axe on shoulder, had just made their\nappearance in battle array at the end of the street.\n\nThis could only be the head of a column; and of what column? The\nattacking column, evidently; the sappers charged with the demolition of\nthe barricade must always precede the soldiers who are to scale it.\n\nThey were, evidently, on the brink of that moment which M.\nClermont-Tonnerre, in 1822, called \"the tug of war.\"\n\nEnjolras' order was executed with the correct haste which is peculiar\nto ships and barricades, the only two scenes of combat where escape\nis impossible. In less than a minute, two thirds of the stones which\nEnjolras had had piled up at the door of Corinthe had been carried up to\nthe first floor and the attic, and before a second minute had elapsed,\nthese stones, artistically set one upon the other, walled up the\nsash-window on the first floor and the windows in the roof to half their\nheight. A few loop-holes carefully planned by Feuilly, the principal\narchitect, allowed of the passage of the gun-barrels. This armament of\nthe windows could be effected all the more easily since the firing of\ngrape-shot had ceased. The two cannons were now discharging ball\nagainst the centre of the barrier in order to make a hole there, and, if\npossible, a breach for the assault.\n\nWhen the stones destined to the final defence were in place, Enjolras\nhad the bottles which he had set under the table where Mabeuf lay,\ncarried to the first floor.\n\n\"Who is to drink that?\" Bossuet asked him.\n\n\"They,\" replied Enjolras.\n\nThen they barricaded the window below, and held in readiness the iron\ncross-bars which served to secure the door of the wine-shop at night.\n\nThe fortress was complete. The barricade was the rampart, the wine-shop\nwas the dungeon. With the stones which remained they stopped up the\noutlet.\n\nAs the defenders of a barricade are always obliged to be sparing of\ntheir ammunition, and as the assailants know this, the assailants\ncombine their arrangements with a sort of irritating leisure, expose\nthemselves to fire prematurely, though in appearance more than in\nreality, and take their ease. The preparations for attack are always\nmade with a certain methodical deliberation; after which, the lightning\nstrikes.\n\nThis deliberation permitted Enjolras to take a review of everything and\nto perfect everything. He felt that, since such men were to die, their\ndeath ought to be a masterpiece.\n\nHe said to Marius: \"We are the two leaders. I will give the last orders\ninside. Do you remain outside and observe.\"\n\nMarius posted himself on the lookout upon the crest of the barricade.\n\nEnjolras had the door of the kitchen, which was the ambulance, as the\nreader will remember, nailed up.\n\n\"No splashing of the wounded,\" he said.\n\nHe issued his final orders in the tap-room in a curt, but profoundly\ntranquil tone; Feuilly listened and replied in the name of all.\n\n\"On the first floor, hold your axes in readiness to cut the staircase.\nHave you them?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Feuilly.\n\n\"How many?\"\n\n\"Two axes and a pole-axe.\"\n\n\"That is good. There are now twenty-six combatants of us on foot. How\nmany guns are there?\"\n\n\"Thirty-four.\"\n\n\"Eight too many. Keep those eight guns loaded like the rest and at\nhand. Swords and pistols in your belts. Twenty men to the barricade. Six\nambushed in the attic windows, and at the window on the first floor to\nfire on the assailants through the loop-holes in the stones. Let not a\nsingle worker remain inactive here. Presently, when the drum beats the\nassault, let the twenty below stairs rush to the barricade. The first to\narrive will have the best places.\"\n\nThese arrangements made, he turned to Javert and said:\n\n\"I am not forgetting you.\"\n\nAnd, laying a pistol on the table, he added:\n\n\"The last man to leave this room will smash the skull of this spy.\"\n\n\"Here?\" inquired a voice.\n\n\"No, let us not mix their corpses with our own. The little barricade of\nthe Mondetour lane can be scaled. It is only four feet high. The man is\nwell pinioned. He shall be taken thither and put to death.\"\n\nThere was some one who was more impassive at that moment than Enjolras,\nit was Javert. Here Jean Valjean made his appearance.\n\nHe had been lost among the group of insurgents. He stepped forth and\nsaid to Enjolras:\n\n\"You are the commander?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"You thanked me a while ago.\"\n\n\"In the name of the Republic. The barricade has two saviors, Marius\nPontmercy and yourself.\"\n\n\"Do you think that I deserve a recompense?\"\n\n\"Certainly.\"\n\n\"Well, I request one.\"\n\n\"What is it?\"\n\n\"That I may blow that man's brains out.\"\n\nJavert raised his head, saw Jean Valjean, made an almost imperceptible\nmovement, and said:\n\n\"That is just.\"\n\nAs for Enjolras, he had begun to re-load his rifle; he cut his eyes\nabout him:\n\n\"No objections.\"\n\nAnd he turned to Jean Valjean:\n\n\"Take the spy.\"\n\nJean Valjean did, in fact, take possession of Javert, by seating\nhimself on the end of the table. He seized the pistol, and a faint click\nannounced that he had cocked it.\n\nAlmost at the same moment, a blast of trumpets became audible.\n\n\"Take care!\" shouted Marius from the top of the barricade.\n\nJavert began to laugh with that noiseless laugh which was peculiar to\nhim, and gazing intently at the insurgents, he said to them:\n\n\"You are in no better case than I am.\"\n\n\"All out!\" shouted Enjolras.\n\nThe insurgents poured out tumultuously, and, as they went, received in\nthe back,--may we be permitted the expression,--this sally of Javert's:\n\n\"We shall meet again shortly!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIX--JEAN VALJEAN TAKES HIS REVENGE\n\nWhen Jean Valjean was left alone with Javert, he untied the rope which\nfastened the prisoner across the middle of the body, and the knot of\nwhich was under the table. After this he made him a sign to rise.\n\nJavert obeyed with that indefinable smile in which the supremacy of\nenchained authority is condensed.\n\nJean Valjean took Javert by the martingale, as one would take a beast of\nburden by the breast-band, and, dragging the latter after him, emerged\nfrom the wine-shop slowly, because Javert, with his impeded limbs, could\ntake only very short steps.\n\nJean Valjean had the pistol in his hand.\n\nIn this manner they crossed the inner trapezium of the barricade. The\ninsurgents, all intent on the attack, which was imminent, had their\nbacks turned to these two.\n\nMarius alone, stationed on one side, at the extreme left of the\nbarricade, saw them pass. This group of victim and executioner was\nilluminated by the sepulchral light which he bore in his own soul.\n\nJean Valjean with some difficulty, but without relaxing his hold for\na single instant, made Javert, pinioned as he was, scale the little\nentrenchment in the Mondetour lane.\n\nWhen they had crossed this barrier, they found themselves alone in the\nlane. No one saw them. Among the heap they could distinguish a livid\nface, streaming hair, a pierced hand and the half nude breast of a\nwoman. It was Eponine. The corner of the houses hid them from the\ninsurgents. The corpses carried away from the barricade formed a\nterrible pile a few paces distant.\n\nJavert gazed askance at this body, and, profoundly calm, said in a low\ntone:\n\n\"It strikes me that I know that girl.\"\n\nThen he turned to Jean Valjean.\n\nJean Valjean thrust the pistol under his arm and fixed on Javert a look\nwhich it required no words to interpret: \"Javert, it is I.\"\n\nJavert replied:\n\n\"Take your revenge.\"\n\nJean Valjean drew from his pocket a knife, and opened it.\n\n\"A clasp-knife!\" exclaimed Javert, \"you are right. That suits you\nbetter.\"\n\nJean Valjean cut the martingale which Javert had about his neck, then he\ncut the cords on his wrists, then, stooping down, he cut the cord on his\nfeet; and, straightening himself up, he said to him:\n\n\"You are free.\"\n\nJavert was not easily astonished. Still, master of himself though\nhe was, he could not repress a start. He remained open-mouthed and\nmotionless.\n\nJean Valjean continued:\n\n\"I do not think that I shall escape from this place. But if, by chance,\nI do, I live, under the name of Fauchelevent, in the Rue de l'Homme\nArme, No. 7.\"\n\nJavert snarled like a tiger, which made him half open one corner of his\nmouth, and he muttered between his teeth:\n\n\"Have a care.\"\n\n\"Go,\" said Jean Valjean.\n\nJavert began again:\n\n\"Thou saidst Fauchelevent, Rue de l'Homme Arme?\"\n\n\"Number 7.\"\n\nJavert repeated in a low voice:--\"Number 7.\"\n\nHe buttoned up his coat once more, resumed the military stiffness\nbetween his shoulders, made a half turn, folded his arms and, supporting\nhis chin on one of his hands, he set out in the direction of the Halles.\nJean Valjean followed him with his eyes:\n\nA few minutes later, Javert turned round and shouted to Jean Valjean:\n\n\"You annoy me. Kill me, rather.\"\n\nJavert himself did not notice that he no longer addressed Jean Valjean\nas \"thou.\"\n\n\"Be off with you,\" said Jean Valjean.\n\nJavert retreated slowly. A moment later he turned the corner of the Rue\ndes Precheurs.\n\nWhen Javert had disappeared, Jean Valjean fired his pistol in the air.\n\nThen he returned to the barricade and said:\n\n\"It is done.\"\n\nIn the meanwhile, this is what had taken place.\n\nMarius, more intent on the outside than on the interior, had not, up to\nthat time, taken a good look at the pinioned spy in the dark background\nof the tap-room.\n\nWhen he beheld him in broad daylight, striding over the barricade in\norder to proceed to his death, he recognized him. Something suddenly\nrecurred to his mind. He recalled the inspector of the Rue de Pontoise,\nand the two pistols which the latter had handed to him and which he,\nMarius, had used in this very barricade, and not only did he recall his\nface, but his name as well.\n\nThis recollection was misty and troubled, however, like all his ideas.\n\nIt was not an affirmation that he made, but a question which he put to\nhimself:\n\n\"Is not that the inspector of police who told me that his name was\nJavert?\"\n\nPerhaps there was still time to intervene in behalf of that man. But, in\nthe first place, he must know whether this was Javert.\n\nMarius called to Enjolras, who had just stationed himself at the other\nextremity of the barricade:\n\n\"Enjolras!\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"What is the name of yonder man?\"\n\n\"What man?\"\n\n\"The police agent. Do you know his name?\"\n\n\"Of course. He told us.\"\n\n\"What is it?\"\n\n\"Javert.\"\n\nMarius sprang to his feet.\n\nAt that moment, they heard the report of the pistol.\n\nJean Valjean re-appeared and cried: \"It is done.\"\n\nA gloomy chill traversed Marius' heart.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XX--THE DEAD ARE IN THE RIGHT AND THE LIVING ARE NOT IN THE\nWRONG\n\nThe death agony of the barricade was about to begin.\n\nEverything contributed to its tragic majesty at that supreme moment; a\nthousand mysterious crashes in the air, the breath of armed masses set\nin movement in the streets which were not visible, the intermittent\ngallop of cavalry, the heavy shock of artillery on the march, the firing\nby squads, and the cannonades crossing each other in the labyrinth\nof Paris, the smokes of battle mounting all gilded above the roofs,\nindescribable and vaguely terrible cries, lightnings of menace\neverywhere, the tocsin of Saint-Merry, which now had the accents of a\nsob, the mildness of the weather, the splendor of the sky filled with\nsun and clouds, the beauty of the day, and the alarming silence of the\nhouses.\n\nFor, since the preceding evening, the two rows of houses in the Rue\nde la Chanvrerie had become two walls; ferocious walls, doors closed,\nwindows closed, shutters closed.\n\nIn those days, so different from those in which we live, when the hour\nwas come, when the people wished to put an end to a situation, which had\nlasted too long, with a charter granted or with a legal country, when\nuniversal wrath was diffused in the atmosphere, when the city consented\nto the tearing up of the pavements, when insurrection made the\nbourgeoisie smile by whispering its password in its ear, then the\ninhabitant, thoroughly penetrated with the revolt, so to speak, was\nthe auxiliary of the combatant, and the house fraternized with the\nimprovised fortress which rested on it. When the situation was not\nripe, when the insurrection was not decidedly admitted, when the masses\ndisowned the movement, all was over with the combatants, the city was\nchanged into a desert around the revolt, souls grew chilled, refuges\nwere nailed up, and the street turned into a defile to help the army to\ntake the barricade.\n\nA people cannot be forced, through surprise, to walk more quickly than\nit chooses. Woe to whomsoever tries to force its hand! A people does not\nlet itself go at random. Then it abandons the insurrection to itself.\nThe insurgents become noxious, infected with the plague. A house is an\nescarpment, a door is a refusal, a facade is a wall. This wall hears,\nsees and will not. It might open and save you. No. This wall is a judge.\nIt gazes at you and condemns you. What dismal things are closed houses.\nThey seem dead, they are living. Life which is, as it were, suspended\nthere, persists there. No one has gone out of them for four and twenty\nhours, but no one is missing from them. In the interior of that rock,\npeople go and come, go to bed and rise again; they are a family party\nthere; there they eat and drink; they are afraid, a terrible thing! Fear\nexcuses this fearful lack of hospitality; terror is mixed with it, an\nextenuating circumstance. Sometimes, even, and this has been actually\nseen, fear turns to passion; fright may change into fury, as prudence\ndoes into rage; hence this wise saying: \"The enraged moderates.\" There\nare outbursts of supreme terror, whence springs wrath like a mournful\nsmoke.--\"What do these people want? What have they come there to do?\nLet them get out of the scrape. So much the worse for them. It is their\nfault. They are only getting what they deserve. It does not concern\nus. Here is our poor street all riddled with balls. They are a pack of\nrascals. Above all things, don't open the door.\"--And the house assumes\nthe air of a tomb. The insurgent is in the death-throes in front of\nthat house; he sees the grape-shot and naked swords drawing near; if\nhe cries, he knows that they are listening to him, and that no one will\ncome; there stand walls which might protect him, there are men who might\nsave him; and these walls have ears of flesh, and these men have bowels\nof stone.\n\nWhom shall he reproach?\n\nNo one and every one.\n\nThe incomplete times in which we live.\n\nIt is always at its own risk and peril that Utopia is converted into\nrevolution, and from philosophical protest becomes an armed protest, and\nfrom Minerva turns to Pallas.\n\nThe Utopia which grows impatient and becomes revolt knows what awaits\nit; it almost always comes too soon. Then it becomes resigned, and\nstoically accepts catastrophe in lieu of triumph. It serves those who\ndeny it without complaint, even excusing them, and even disculpates\nthem, and its magnanimity consists in consenting to abandonment. It is\nindomitable in the face of obstacles and gentle towards ingratitude.\n\nIs this ingratitude, however?\n\nYes, from the point of view of the human race.\n\nNo, from the point of view of the individual.\n\nProgress is man's mode of existence. The general life of the human race\nis called Progress, the collective stride of the human race is called\nProgress. Progress advances; it makes the great human and terrestrial\njourney towards the celestial and the divine; it has its halting\nplaces where it rallies the laggard troop, it has its stations where it\nmeditates, in the presence of some splendid Canaan suddenly unveiled\non its horizon, it has its nights when it sleeps; and it is one of the\npoignant anxieties of the thinker that he sees the shadow resting on the\nhuman soul, and that he gropes in darkness without being able to awaken\nthat slumbering Progress.\n\n\"God is dead, perhaps,\" said Gerard de Nerval one day to the writer of\nthese lines, confounding progress with God, and taking the interruption\nof movement for the death of Being.\n\nHe who despairs is in the wrong. Progress infallibly awakes, and, in\nshort, we may say that it marches on, even when it is asleep, for it has\nincreased in size. When we behold it erect once more, we find it taller.\nTo be always peaceful does not depend on progress any more than it does\non the stream; erect no barriers, cast in no boulders; obstacles make\nwater froth and humanity boil. Hence arise troubles; but after these\ntroubles, we recognize the fact that ground has been gained. Until\norder, which is nothing else than universal peace, has been established,\nuntil harmony and unity reign, progress will have revolutions as its\nhalting-places.\n\nWhat, then, is progress? We have just enunciated it; the permanent life\nof the peoples.\n\nNow, it sometimes happens, that the momentary life of individuals offers\nresistance to the eternal life of the human race.\n\nLet us admit without bitterness, that the individual has his distinct\ninterests, and can, without forfeiture, stipulate for his interest, and\ndefend it; the present has its pardonable dose of egotism; momentary\nlife has its rights, and is not bound to sacrifice itself constantly to\nthe future. The generation which is passing in its turn over the earth,\nis not forced to abridge it for the sake of the generations, its equal,\nafter all, who will have their turn later on.--\"I exist,\" murmurs that\nsome one whose name is All. \"I am young and in love, I am old and I\nwish to repose, I am the father of a family, I toil, I prosper, I am\nsuccessful in business, I have houses to lease, I have money in the\ngovernment funds, I am happy, I have a wife and children, I have all\nthis, I desire to live, leave me in peace.\"--Hence, at certain hours, a\nprofound cold broods over the magnanimous vanguard of the human race.\n\nUtopia, moreover, we must admit, quits its radiant sphere when it makes\nwar. It, the truth of to-morrow, borrows its mode of procedure, battle,\nfrom the lie of yesterday. It, the future, behaves like the past. It,\npure idea, becomes a deed of violence. It complicates its heroism with\na violence for which it is just that it should be held to answer; a\nviolence of occasion and expedient, contrary to principle, and for which\nit is fatally punished. The Utopia, insurrection, fights with the old\nmilitary code in its fist; it shoots spies, it executes traitors; it\nsuppresses living beings and flings them into unknown darkness. It makes\nuse of death, a serious matter. It seems as though Utopia had no longer\nany faith in radiance, its irresistible and incorruptible force. It\nstrikes with the sword. Now, no sword is simple. Every blade has two\nedges; he who wounds with the one is wounded with the other.\n\nHaving made this reservation, and made it with all severity, it is\nimpossible for us not to admire, whether they succeed or not, those the\nglorious combatants of the future, the confessors of Utopia. Even when\nthey miscarry, they are worthy of veneration; and it is, perhaps, in\nfailure, that they possess the most majesty. Victory, when it is in\naccord with progress, merits the applause of the people; but a heroic\ndefeat merits their tender compassion. The one is magnificent, the other\nsublime. For our own part, we prefer martyrdom to success. John Brown is\ngreater than Washington, and Pisacane is greater than Garibaldi.\n\nIt certainly is necessary that some one should take the part of the\nvanquished.\n\nWe are unjust towards these great men who attempt the future, when they\nfail.\n\nRevolutionists are accused of sowing fear abroad. Every barricade seems\na crime. Their theories are incriminated, their aim suspected, their\nulterior motive is feared, their conscience denounced. They are\nreproached with raising, erecting, and heaping up, against the reigning\nsocial state, a mass of miseries, of griefs, of iniquities, of wrongs,\nof despairs, and of tearing from the lowest depths blocks of shadow\nin order therein to embattle themselves and to combat. People shout\nto them: \"You are tearing up the pavements of hell!\" They might reply:\n\"That is because our barricade is made of good intentions.\"\n\nThe best thing, assuredly, is the pacific solution. In short, let us\nagree that when we behold the pavement, we think of the bear, and it is\na good will which renders society uneasy. But it depends on society\nto save itself, it is to its own good will that we make our appeal.\nNo violent remedy is necessary. To study evil amiably, to prove its\nexistence, then to cure it. It is to this that we invite it.\n\nHowever that may be, even when fallen, above all when fallen, these men,\nwho at every point of the universe, with their eyes fixed on France, are\nstriving for the grand work with the inflexible logic of the ideal,\nare august; they give their life a free offering to progress; they\naccomplish the will of providence; they perform a religious act. At the\nappointed hour, with as much disinterestedness as an actor who answers\nto his cue, in obedience to the divine stage-manager, they enter the\ntomb. And this hopeless combat, this stoical disappearance they accept\nin order to bring about the supreme and universal consequences, the\nmagnificent and irresistibly human movement begun on the 14th of July,\n1789; these soldiers are priests. The French revolution is an act of\nGod.\n\nMoreover, there are, and it is proper to add this distinction to the\ndistinctions already pointed out in another chapter,--there are accepted\nrevolutions, revolutions which are called revolutions; there are refused\nrevolutions, which are called riots.\n\nAn insurrection which breaks out, is an idea which is passing its\nexamination before the people. If the people lets fall a black ball, the\nidea is dried fruit; the insurrection is a mere skirmish.\n\nWaging war at every summons and every time that Utopia desires it, is\nnot the thing for the peoples. Nations have not always and at every hour\nthe temperament of heroes and martyrs.\n\nThey are positive. A priori, insurrection is repugnant to them, in the\nfirst place, because it often results in a catastrophe, in the second\nplace, because it always has an abstraction as its point of departure.\n\nBecause, and this is a noble thing, it is always for the ideal, and for\nthe ideal alone, that those who sacrifice themselves do thus sacrifice\nthemselves. An insurrection is an enthusiasm. Enthusiasm may wax wroth;\nhence the appeal to arms. But every insurrection, which aims at a\ngovernment or a regime, aims higher. Thus, for instance, and we\ninsist upon it, what the chiefs of the insurrection of 1832, and, in\nparticular, the young enthusiasts of the Rue de la Chanvrerie were\ncombating, was not precisely Louis Philippe. The majority of them,\nwhen talking freely, did justice to this king who stood midway between\nmonarchy and revolution; no one hated him. But they attacked the younger\nbranch of the divine right in Louis Philippe as they had attacked its\nelder branch in Charles X.; and that which they wished to overturn in\noverturning royalty in France, was, as we have explained, the usurpation\nof man over man, and of privilege over right in the entire universe.\nParis without a king has as result the world without despots. This is\nthe manner in which they reasoned. Their aim was distant no doubt,\nvague perhaps, and it retreated in the face of their efforts; but it was\ngreat.\n\nThus it is. And we sacrifice ourselves for these visions, which are\nalmost always illusions for the sacrificed, but illusions with which,\nafter all, the whole of human certainty is mingled. We throw ourselves\ninto these tragic affairs and become intoxicated with that which we are\nabout to do. Who knows? We may succeed. We are few in number, we have a\nwhole army arrayed against us; but we are defending right, the natural\nlaw, the sovereignty of each one over himself from which no abdication\nis possible, justice and truth, and in case of need, we die like the\nthree hundred Spartans. We do not think of Don Quixote but of Leonidas.\nAnd we march straight before us, and once pledged, we do not draw\nback, and we rush onwards with head held low, cherishing as our hope an\nunprecedented victory, revolution completed, progress set free again,\nthe aggrandizement of the human race, universal deliverance; and in the\nevent of the worst, Thermopylae.\n\nThese passages of arms for the sake of progress often suffer shipwreck,\nand we have just explained why. The crowd is restive in the presence of\nthe impulses of paladins. Heavy masses, the multitudes which are fragile\nbecause of their very weight, fear adventures; and there is a touch of\nadventure in the ideal.\n\nMoreover, and we must not forget this, interests which are not very\nfriendly to the ideal and the sentimental are in the way. Sometimes the\nstomach paralyzes the heart.\n\nThe grandeur and beauty of France lies in this, that she takes less from\nthe stomach than other nations: she more easily knots the rope about her\nloins. She is the first awake, the last asleep. She marches forwards.\nShe is a seeker.\n\nThis arises from the fact that she is an artist.\n\nThe ideal is nothing but the culminating point of logic, the same as the\nbeautiful is nothing but the summit of the true. Artistic peoples are\nalso consistent peoples. To love beauty is to see the light. That is why\nthe torch of Europe, that is to say of civilization, was first borne by\nGreece, who passed it on to Italy, who handed it on to France. Divine,\nilluminating nations of scouts! Vitaelampada tradunt.\n\nIt is an admirable thing that the poetry of a people is the element of\nits progress. The amount of civilization is measured by the quantity\nof imagination. Only, a civilizing people should remain a manly people.\nCorinth, yes; Sybaris, no. Whoever becomes effeminate makes himself a\nbastard. He must be neither a dilettante nor a virtuoso: but he must be\nartistic. In the matter of civilization, he must not refine, but he must\nsublime. On this condition, one gives to the human race the pattern of\nthe ideal.\n\nThe modern ideal has its type in art, and its means is science. It is\nthrough science that it will realize that august vision of the poets,\nthe socially beautiful. Eden will be reconstructed by A+B. At the point\nwhich civilization has now reached, the exact is a necessary element\nof the splendid, and the artistic sentiment is not only served, but\ncompleted by the scientific organ; dreams must be calculated. Art, which\nis the conqueror, should have for support science, which is the walker;\nthe solidity of the creature which is ridden is of importance. The\nmodern spirit is the genius of Greece with the genius of India as its\nvehicle; Alexander on the elephant.\n\nRaces which are petrified in dogma or demoralized by lucre are unfit to\nguide civilization. Genuflection before the idol or before money wastes\naway the muscles which walk and the will which advances. Hieratic or\nmercantile absorption lessens a people's power of radiance, lowers its\nhorizon by lowering its level, and deprives it of that intelligence,\nat once both human and divine of the universal goal, which makes\nmissionaries of nations. Babylon has no ideal; Carthage has no ideal.\nAthens and Rome have and keep, throughout all the nocturnal darkness of\nthe centuries, halos of civilization.\n\nFrance is in the same quality of race as Greece and Italy. She is\nAthenian in the matter of beauty, and Roman in her greatness. Moreover,\nshe is good. She gives herself. Oftener than is the case with other\nraces, is she in the humor for self-devotion and sacrifice. Only, this\nhumor seizes upon her, and again abandons her. And therein lies the\ngreat peril for those who run when she desires only to walk, or who walk\non when she desires to halt. France has her relapses into materialism,\nand, at certain instants, the ideas which obstruct that sublime brain\nhave no longer anything which recalls French greatness and are of the\ndimensions of a Missouri or a South Carolina. What is to be done in\nsuch a case? The giantess plays at being a dwarf; immense France has her\nfreaks of pettiness. That is all.\n\nTo this there is nothing to say. Peoples, like planets, possess the\nright to an eclipse. And all is well, provided that the light\nreturns and that the eclipse does not degenerate into night. Dawn and\nresurrection are synonymous. The reappearance of the light is identical\nwith the persistence of the _I_.\n\nLet us state these facts calmly. Death on the barricade or the tomb in\nexile, is an acceptable occasion for devotion. The real name of\ndevotion is disinterestedness. Let the abandoned allow themselves to\nbe abandoned, let the exiled allow themselves to be exiled, and let us\nconfine ourselves to entreating great nations not to retreat too far,\nwhen they do retreat. One must not push too far in descent under pretext\nof a return to reason.\n\nMatter exists, the minute exists, interest exists, the stomach exists;\nbut the stomach must not be the sole wisdom. The life of the moment has\nits rights, we admit, but permanent life has its rights also. Alas! the\nfact that one is mounted does not preclude a fall. This can be seen in\nhistory more frequently than is desirable: A nation is great, it tastes\nthe ideal, then it bites the mire, and finds it good; and if it be asked\nhow it happens that it has abandoned Socrates for Falstaff, it replies:\n\"Because I love statesmen.\"\n\nOne word more before returning to our subject, the conflict.\n\nA battle like the one which we are engaged in describing is nothing else\nthan a convulsion towards the ideal. Progress trammelled is sickly, and\nis subject to these tragic epilepsies. With that malady of progress,\ncivil war, we have been obliged to come in contact in our passage. This\nis one of the fatal phases, at once act and entr'acte of that drama\nwhose pivot is a social condemnation, and whose veritable title is\nProgress.\n\nProgress!\n\nThe cry to which we frequently give utterance is our whole thought; and,\nat the point of this drama which we have now reached, the idea which it\ncontains having still more than one trial to undergo, it is, perhaps,\npermitted to us, if not to lift the veil from it, to at least allow its\nlight to shine through.\n\nThe book which the reader has under his eye at this moment is, from\none end to the other, as a whole and in detail, whatever may be its\nintermittences, exceptions and faults, the march from evil to good, from\nthe unjust to the just, from night to day, from appetite to conscience,\nfrom rottenness to life, from hell to heaven, from nothingness to God.\nPoint of departure: matter; point of arrival: the soul. The hydra at the\nbeginning, the angel at the end.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXI--THE HEROES\n\nAll at once, the drum beat the charge.\n\nThe attack was a hurricane. On the evening before, in the darkness,\nthe barricade had been approached silently, as by a boa. Now, in broad\ndaylight, in that widening street, surprise was decidedly impossible,\nrude force had, moreover, been unmasked, the cannon had begun the\nroar, the army hurled itself on the barricade. Fury now became skill.\nA powerful detachment of infantry of the line, broken at regular\nintervals, by the National Guard and the Municipal Guard on foot,\nand supported by serried masses which could be heard though not seen,\ndebauched into the street at a run, with drums beating, trumpets\nbraying, bayonets levelled, the sappers at their head, and,\nimperturbable under the projectiles, charged straight for the barricade\nwith the weight of a brazen beam against a wall.\n\nThe wall held firm.\n\nThe insurgents fired impetuously. The barricade once scaled had a mane\nof lightning flashes. The assault was so furious, that for one moment,\nit was inundated with assailants; but it shook off the soldiers as the\nlion shakes off the dogs, and it was only covered with besiegers as\nthe cliff is covered with foam, to re-appear, a moment later, beetling,\nblack and formidable.\n\nThe column, forced to retreat, remained massed in the street,\nunprotected but terrible, and replied to the redoubt with a terrible\ndischarge of musketry. Any one who has seen fireworks will recall the\nsheaf formed of interlacing lightnings which is called a bouquet. Let\nthe reader picture to himself this bouquet, no longer vertical but\nhorizontal, bearing a bullet, buck-shot or a biscaien at the tip of each\none of its jets of flame, and picking off dead men one after another\nfrom its clusters of lightning. The barricade was underneath it.\n\nOn both sides, the resolution was equal. The bravery exhibited there\nwas almost barbarous and was complicated with a sort of heroic ferocity\nwhich began by the sacrifice of self.\n\nThis was the epoch when a National Guardsman fought like a Zouave.\nThe troop wished to make an end of it, insurrection was desirous of\nfighting. The acceptance of the death agony in the flower of youth and\nin the flush of health turns intrepidity into frenzy. In this fray, each\none underwent the broadening growth of the death hour. The street was\nstrewn with corpses.\n\nThe barricade had Enjolras at one of its extremities and Marius at the\nother. Enjolras, who carried the whole barricade in his head, reserved\nand sheltered himself; three soldiers fell, one after the other, under\nhis embrasure, without having even seen him; Marius fought unprotected.\nHe made himself a target. He stood with more than half his body above\nthe breastworks. There is no more violent prodigal than the avaricious\nman who takes the bit in his teeth; there is no man more terrible in\naction than a dreamer. Marius was formidable and pensive. In battle he\nwas as in a dream. One would have pronounced him a phantom engaged in\nfiring a gun.\n\nThe insurgents' cartridges were giving out; but not their sarcasms. In\nthis whirlwind of the sepulchre in which they stood, they laughed.\n\nCourfeyrac was bare-headed.\n\n\"What have you done with your hat?\" Bossuet asked him.\n\nCourfeyrac replied:\n\n\"They have finally taken it away from me with cannon-balls.\"\n\nOr they uttered haughty comments.\n\n\"Can any one understand,\" exclaimed Feuilly bitterly, \"those men,--[and\nhe cited names, well-known names, even celebrated names, some belonging\nto the old army]--who had promised to join us, and taken an oath to aid\nus, and who had pledged their honor to it, and who are our generals, and\nwho abandon us!\"\n\nAnd Combeferre restricted himself to replying with a grave smile.\n\n\"There are people who observe the rules of honor as one observes the\nstars, from a great distance.\"\n\nThe interior of the barricade was so strewn with torn cartridges that\none would have said that there had been a snowstorm.\n\nThe assailants had numbers in their favor; the insurgents had position.\nThey were at the top of a wall, and they thundered point-blank upon\nthe soldiers tripping over the dead and wounded and entangled in\nthe escarpment. This barricade, constructed as it was and admirably\nbuttressed, was really one of those situations where a handful of men\nhold a legion in check. Nevertheless, the attacking column, constantly\nrecruited and enlarged under the shower of bullets, drew inexorably\nnearer, and now, little by little, step by step, but surely, the army\nclosed in around the barricade as the vice grasps the wine-press.\n\nOne assault followed another. The horror of the situation kept\nincreasing.\n\nThen there burst forth on that heap of paving-stones, in that Rue de la\nChanvrerie, a battle worthy of a wall of Troy. These haggard, ragged,\nexhausted men, who had had nothing to eat for four and twenty hours, who\nhad not slept, who had but a few more rounds to fire, who were fumbling\nin their pockets which had been emptied of cartridges, nearly all\nof whom were wounded, with head or arm bandaged with black and\nblood-stained linen, with holes in their clothes from which the blood\ntrickled, and who were hardly armed with poor guns and notched swords,\nbecame Titans. The barricade was ten times attacked, approached,\nassailed, scaled, and never captured.\n\nIn order to form an idea of this struggle, it is necessary to imagine\nfire set to a throng of terrible courages, and then to gaze at the\nconflagration. It was not a combat, it was the interior of a furnace;\nthere mouths breathed the flame; there countenances were extraordinary.\nThe human form seemed impossible there, the combatants flamed forth\nthere, and it was formidable to behold the going and coming in that red\nglow of those salamanders of the fray.\n\nThe successive and simultaneous scenes of this grand slaughter we\nrenounce all attempts at depicting. The epic alone has the right to fill\ntwelve thousand verses with a battle.\n\nOne would have pronounced this that hell of Brahmanism, the most\nredoubtable of the seventeen abysses, which the Veda calls the Forest of\nSwords.\n\nThey fought hand to hand, foot to foot, with pistol shots, with blows of\nthe sword, with their fists, at a distance, close at hand, from above,\nfrom below, from everywhere, from the roofs of the houses, from the\nwindows of the wine-shop, from the cellar windows, whither some had\ncrawled. They were one against sixty.\n\nThe facade of Corinthe, half demolished, was hideous. The window,\ntattooed with grape-shot, had lost glass and frame and was nothing now\nbut a shapeless hole, tumultuously blocked with paving-stones.\n\nBossuet was killed; Feuilly was killed; Courfeyrac was killed;\nCombeferre, transfixed by three blows from a bayonet in the breast at\nthe moment when he was lifting up a wounded soldier, had only time to\ncast a glance to heaven when he expired.\n\nMarius, still fighting, was so riddled with wounds, particularly in the\nhead, that his countenance disappeared beneath the blood, and one would\nhave said that his face was covered with a red kerchief.\n\nEnjolras alone was not struck. When he had no longer any weapon, he\nreached out his hands to right and left and an insurgent thrust some arm\nor other into his fist. All he had left was the stumps of four swords;\none more than Francois I. at Marignan. Homer says: \"Diomedes cuts\nthe throat of Axylus, son of Teuthranis, who dwelt in happy Arisba;\nEuryalus, son of Mecistaeus, exterminates Dresos and Opheltios,\nEsepius, and that Pedasus whom the naiad Abarbarea bore to the blameless\nBucolion; Ulysses overthrows Pidytes of Percosius; Antilochus, Ablerus;\nPolypaetes, Astyalus; Polydamas, Otos, of Cyllene; and Teucer, Aretaon.\nMeganthios dies under the blows of Euripylus' pike. Agamemnon, king\nof the heroes, flings to earth Elatos, born in the rocky city which\nis laved by the sounding river Satnois.\" In our old poems of exploits,\nEsplandian attacks the giant marquis Swantibore with a cobbler's\nshoulder-stick of fire, and the latter defends himself by stoning the\nhero with towers which he plucks up by the roots. Our ancient mural\nfrescoes show us the two Dukes of Bretagne and Bourbon, armed,\nemblazoned and crested in war-like guise, on horseback and approaching\neach other, their battle-axes in hand, masked with iron, gloved with\niron, booted with iron, the one caparisoned in ermine, the other draped\nin azure: Bretagne with his lion between the two horns of his crown,\nBourbon helmeted with a monster fleur de lys on his visor. But, in order\nto be superb, it is not necessary to wear, like Yvon, the ducal morion,\nto have in the fist, like Esplandian, a living flame, or, like Phyles,\nfather of Polydamas, to have brought back from Ephyra a good suit of\nmail, a present from the king of men, Euphetes; it suffices to give\none's life for a conviction or a loyalty. This ingenuous little\nsoldier, yesterday a peasant of Bauce or Limousin, who prowls with his\nclasp-knife by his side, around the children's nurses in the Luxembourg\ngarden, this pale young student bent over a piece of anatomy or a book,\na blond youth who shaves his beard with scissors,--take both of them,\nbreathe upon them with a breath of duty, place them face to face in the\nCarrefour Boucherat or in the blind alley Planche-Mibray, and let the\none fight for his flag, and the other for his ideal, and let both of\nthem imagine that they are fighting for their country; the struggle will\nbe colossal; and the shadow which this raw recruit and this sawbones\nin conflict will produce in that grand epic field where humanity\nis striving, will equal the shadow cast by Megaryon, King of Lycia,\ntiger-filled, crushing in his embrace the immense body of Ajax, equal to\nthe gods.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXII--FOOT TO FOOT\n\nWhen there were no longer any of the leaders left alive, except Enjolras\nand Marius at the two extremities of the barricade, the centre, which\nhad so long sustained Courfeyrac, Joly, Bossuet, Feuilly and Combeferre,\ngave way. The cannon, though it had not effected a practicable breach,\nhad made a rather large hollow in the middle of the redoubt; there, the\nsummit of the wall had disappeared before the balls, and had crumbled\naway; and the rubbish which had fallen, now inside, now outside, had,\nas it accumulated, formed two piles in the nature of slopes on the two\nsides of the barrier, one on the inside, the other on the outside. The\nexterior slope presented an inclined plane to the attack.\n\nA final assault was there attempted, and this assault succeeded. The\nmass bristling with bayonets and hurled forward at a run, came up with\nirresistible force, and the serried front of battle of the attacking\ncolumn made its appearance through the smoke on the crest of the\nbattlements. This time, it was decisive. The group of insurgents who\nwere defending the centre retreated in confusion.\n\nThen the gloomy love of life awoke once more in some of them. Many,\nfinding themselves under the muzzles of this forest of guns, did not\nwish to die. This is a moment when the instinct of self-preservation\nemits howls, when the beast re-appears in men. They were hemmed in by\nthe lofty, six-story house which formed the background of their redoubt.\nThis house might prove their salvation. The building was barricaded, and\nwalled, as it were, from top to bottom. Before the troops of the line\nhad reached the interior of the redoubt, there was time for a door to\nopen and shut, the space of a flash of lightning was sufficient for\nthat, and the door of that house, suddenly opened a crack and closed\nagain instantly, was life for these despairing men. Behind this house,\nthere were streets, possible flight, space. They set to knocking at that\ndoor with the butts of their guns, and with kicks, shouting, calling,\nentreating, wringing their hands. No one opened. From the little window\non the third floor, the head of the dead man gazed down upon them.\n\nBut Enjolras and Marius, and the seven or eight rallied about them,\nsprang forward and protected them. Enjolras had shouted to the soldiers:\n\"Don't advance!\" and as an officer had not obeyed, Enjolras had killed\nthe officer. He was now in the little inner court of the redoubt, with\nhis back planted against the Corinthe building, a sword in one hand,\na rifle in the other, holding open the door of the wine-shop which he\nbarred against assailants. He shouted to the desperate men:--\"There is\nbut one door open; this one.\"--And shielding them with his body, and\nfacing an entire battalion alone, he made them pass in behind him. All\nprecipitated themselves thither. Enjolras, executing with his rifle,\nwhich he now used like a cane, what single-stick players call a \"covered\nrose\" round his head, levelled the bayonets around and in front of him,\nand was the last to enter; and then ensued a horrible moment, when the\nsoldiers tried to make their way in, and the insurgents strove to bar\nthem out. The door was slammed with such violence, that, as it fell back\ninto its frame, it showed the five fingers of a soldier who had been\nclinging to it, cut off and glued to the post.\n\nMarius remained outside. A shot had just broken his collar bone, he\nfelt that he was fainting and falling. At that moment, with eyes already\nshut, he felt the shock of a vigorous hand seizing him, and the swoon\nin which his senses vanished, hardly allowed him time for the thought,\nmingled with a last memory of Cosette:--\"I am taken prisoner. I shall be\nshot.\"\n\nEnjolras, not seeing Marius among those who had taken refuge in the\nwine-shop, had the same idea. But they had reached a moment when each\nman has not the time to meditate on his own death. Enjolras fixed the\nbar across the door, and bolted it, and double-locked it with key and\nchain, while those outside were battering furiously at it, the soldiers\nwith the butts of their muskets, the sappers with their axes. The\nassailants were grouped about that door. The siege of the wine-shop was\nnow beginning.\n\nThe soldiers, we will observe, were full of wrath.\n\nThe death of the artillery-sergeant had enraged them, and then, a still\nmore melancholy circumstance. During the few hours which had preceded\nthe attack, it had been reported among them that the insurgents were\nmutilating their prisoners, and that there was the headless body of\na soldier in the wine-shop. This sort of fatal rumor is the usual\naccompaniment of civil wars, and it was a false report of this kind\nwhich, later on, produced the catastrophe of the Rue Transnonain.\n\nWhen the door was barricaded, Enjolras said to the others:\n\n\"Let us sell our lives dearly.\"\n\nThen he approached the table on which lay Mabeuf and Gavroche. Beneath\nthe black cloth two straight and rigid forms were visible, one large,\nthe other small, and the two faces were vaguely outlined beneath the\ncold folds of the shroud. A hand projected from beneath the winding\nsheet and hung near the floor. It was that of the old man.\n\nEnjolras bent down and kissed that venerable hand, just as he had kissed\nhis brow on the preceding evening.\n\nThese were the only two kisses which he had bestowed in the course of\nhis life.\n\nLet us abridge the tale. The barricade had fought like a gate of Thebes;\nthe wine-shop fought like a house of Saragossa. These resistances are\ndogged. No quarter. No flag of truce possible. Men are willing to die,\nprovided their opponent will kill them.\n\nWhen Suchet says:--\"Capitulate,\"--Palafox replies: \"After the war with\ncannon, the war with knives.\" Nothing was lacking in the capture by\nassault of the Hucheloup wine-shop; neither paving-stones raining from\nthe windows and the roof on the besiegers and exasperating the soldiers\nby crushing them horribly, nor shots fired from the attic-windows and\nthe cellar, nor the fury of attack, nor, finally, when the door yielded,\nthe frenzied madness of extermination. The assailants, rushing into the\nwine-shop, their feet entangled in the panels of the door which had been\nbeaten in and flung on the ground, found not a single combatant there.\nThe spiral staircase, hewn asunder with the axe, lay in the middle of\nthe tap-room, a few wounded men were just breathing their last, every\none who was not killed was on the first floor, and from there, through\nthe hole in the ceiling, which had formed the entrance of the stairs,\na terrific fire burst forth. It was the last of their cartridges. When\nthey were exhausted, when these formidable men on the point of death had\nno longer either powder or ball, each grasped in his hands two of the\nbottles which Enjolras had reserved, and of which we have spoken, and\nheld the scaling party in check with these frightfully fragile clubs.\nThey were bottles of aquafortis.\n\nWe relate these gloomy incidents of carnage as they occurred. The\nbesieged man, alas! converts everything into a weapon. Greek fire did\nnot disgrace Archimedes, boiling pitch did not disgrace Bayard. All war\nis a thing of terror, and there is no choice in it. The musketry of the\nbesiegers, though confined and embarrassed by being directed from below\nupwards, was deadly. The rim of the hole in the ceiling was speedily\nsurrounded by heads of the slain, whence dripped long, red and smoking\nstreams, the uproar was indescribable; a close and burning smoke almost\nproduced night over this combat. Words are lacking to express horror\nwhen it has reached this pitch. There were no longer men in this\nconflict, which was now infernal. They were no longer giants matched\nwith colossi. It resembled Milton and Dante rather than Homer. Demons\nattacked, spectres resisted.\n\nIt was heroism become monstrous.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIII--ORESTES FASTING AND PYLADES DRUNK\n\nAt length, by dint of mounting on each other's backs, aiding themselves\nwith the skeleton of the staircase, climbing up the walls, clinging to\nthe ceiling, slashing away at the very brink of the trap-door, the last\none who offered resistance, a score of assailants, soldiers, National\nGuardsmen, municipal guardsmen, in utter confusion, the majority\ndisfigured by wounds in the face during that redoubtable ascent, blinded\nby blood, furious, rendered savage, made an irruption into the apartment\non the first floor. There they found only one man still on his feet,\nEnjolras. Without cartridges, without sword, he had nothing in his hand\nnow but the barrel of his gun whose stock he had broken over the head\nof those who were entering. He had placed the billiard table between his\nassailants and himself; he had retreated into the corner of the room,\nand there, with haughty eye, and head borne high, with this stump of a\nweapon in his hand, he was still so alarming as to speedily create an\nempty space around him. A cry arose:\n\n\"He is the leader! It was he who slew the artillery-man. It is well that\nhe has placed himself there. Let him remain there. Let us shoot him down\non the spot.\"\n\n\"Shoot me,\" said Enjolras.\n\nAnd flinging away his bit of gun-barrel, and folding his arms, he\noffered his breast.\n\nThe audacity of a fine death always affects men. As soon as Enjolras\nfolded his arms and accepted his end, the din of strife ceased in\nthe room, and this chaos suddenly stilled into a sort of sepulchral\nsolemnity. The menacing majesty of Enjolras disarmed and motionless,\nappeared to oppress this tumult, and this young man, haughty, bloody,\nand charming, who alone had not a wound, who was as indifferent as an\ninvulnerable being, seemed, by the authority of his tranquil glance, to\nconstrain this sinister rabble to kill him respectfully. His beauty, at\nthat moment augmented by his pride, was resplendent, and he was fresh\nand rosy after the fearful four and twenty hours which had just elapsed,\nas though he could no more be fatigued than wounded. It was of him,\npossibly, that a witness spoke afterwards, before the council of\nwar: \"There was an insurgent whom I heard called Apollo.\" A National\nGuardsman who had taken aim at Enjolras, lowered his gun, saying: \"It\nseems to me that I am about to shoot a flower.\"\n\nTwelve men formed into a squad in the corner opposite Enjolras, and\nsilently made ready their guns.\n\nThen a sergeant shouted:\n\n\"Take aim!\"\n\nAn officer intervened.\n\n\"Wait.\"\n\nAnd addressing Enjolras:\n\n\"Do you wish to have your eyes bandaged?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Was it you who killed the artillery sergeant?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nGrantaire had waked up a few moments before.\n\nGrantaire, it will be remembered, had been asleep ever since the\npreceding evening in the upper room of the wine-shop, seated on a chair\nand leaning on the table.\n\nHe realized in its fullest sense the old metaphor of \"dead drunk.\" The\nhideous potion of absinthe-porter and alcohol had thrown him into a\nlethargy. His table being small, and not suitable for the barricade,\nhe had been left in possession of it. He was still in the same posture,\nwith his breast bent over the table, his head lying flat on his arms,\nsurrounded by glasses, beer-jugs and bottles. His was the overwhelming\nslumber of the torpid bear and the satiated leech. Nothing had had any\neffect upon it, neither the fusillade, nor the cannon-balls, nor the\ngrape-shot which had made its way through the window into the room where\nhe was. Nor the tremendous uproar of the assault. He merely replied to\nthe cannonade, now and then, by a snore. He seemed to be waiting there\nfor a bullet which should spare him the trouble of waking. Many corpses\nwere strewn around him; and, at the first glance, there was nothing to\ndistinguish him from those profound sleepers of death.\n\nNoise does not rouse a drunken man; silence awakens him. The fall\nof everything around him only augmented Grantaire's prostration; the\ncrumbling of all things was his lullaby. The sort of halt which the\ntumult underwent in the presence of Enjolras was a shock to this heavy\nslumber. It had the effect of a carriage going at full speed, which\nsuddenly comes to a dead stop. The persons dozing within it wake up.\nGrantaire rose to his feet with a start, stretched out his arms, rubbed\nhis eyes, stared, yawned, and understood.\n\nA fit of drunkenness reaching its end resembles a curtain which is torn\naway. One beholds, at a single glance and as a whole, all that it has\nconcealed. All suddenly presents itself to the memory; and the drunkard\nwho has known nothing of what has been taking place during the last\ntwenty-four hours, has no sooner opened his eyes than he is perfectly\ninformed. Ideas recur to him with abrupt lucidity; the obliteration\nof intoxication, a sort of steam which has obscured the brain, is\ndissipated, and makes way for the clear and sharply outlined importunity\nof realities.\n\nRelegated, as he was, to one corner, and sheltered behind the\nbilliard-table, the soldiers whose eyes were fixed on Enjolras, had not\neven noticed Grantaire, and the sergeant was preparing to repeat his\norder: \"Take aim!\" when all at once, they heard a strong voice shout\nbeside them:\n\n\"Long live the Republic! I'm one of them.\"\n\nGrantaire had risen. The immense gleam of the whole combat which he\nhad missed, and in which he had had no part, appeared in the brilliant\nglance of the transfigured drunken man.\n\nHe repeated: \"Long live the Republic!\" crossed the room with a firm\nstride and placed himself in front of the guns beside Enjolras.\n\n\"Finish both of us at one blow,\" said he.\n\nAnd turning gently to Enjolras, he said to him:\n\n\"Do you permit it?\"\n\nEnjolras pressed his hand with a smile.\n\nThis smile was not ended when the report resounded.\n\nEnjolras, pierced by eight bullets, remained leaning against the wall,\nas though the balls had nailed him there. Only, his head was bowed.\n\nGrantaire fell at his feet, as though struck by a thunderbolt.\n\nA few moments later, the soldiers dislodged the last remaining\ninsurgents, who had taken refuge at the top of the house. They fired\ninto the attic through a wooden lattice. They fought under the very\nroof. They flung bodies, some of them still alive, out through the\nwindows. Two light-infantrymen, who tried to lift the shattered omnibus,\nwere slain by two shots fired from the attic. A man in a blouse was\nflung down from it, with a bayonet wound in the abdomen, and breathed\nhis last on the ground. A soldier and an insurgent slipped together\non the sloping slates of the roof, and, as they would not release each\nother, they fell, clasped in a ferocious embrace. A similar conflict\nwent on in the cellar. Shouts, shots, a fierce trampling. Then silence.\nThe barricade was captured.\n\nThe soldiers began to search the houses round about, and to pursue the\nfugitives.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIV--PRISONER\n\nMarius was, in fact, a prisoner.\n\nThe hand which had seized him from behind and whose grasp he had felt\nat the moment of his fall and his loss of consciousness was that of Jean\nValjean.\n\nJean Valjean had taken no other part in the combat than to expose\nhimself in it. Had it not been for him, no one, in that supreme phase\nof agony, would have thought of the wounded. Thanks to him, everywhere\npresent in the carnage, like a providence, those who fell were picked\nup, transported to the tap-room, and cared for. In the intervals, he\nreappeared on the barricade. But nothing which could resemble a blow,\nan attack or even personal defence proceeded from his hands. He held his\npeace and lent succor. Moreover he had received only a few scratches.\nThe bullets would have none of him. If suicide formed part of what he\nhad meditated on coming to this sepulchre, to that spot, he had\nnot succeeded. But we doubt whether he had thought of suicide, an\nirreligious act.\n\nJean Valjean, in the thick cloud of the combat, did not appear to see\nMarius; the truth is, that he never took his eyes from the latter. When\na shot laid Marius low, Jean Valjean leaped forward with the agility of\na tiger, fell upon him as on his prey, and bore him off.\n\nThe whirlwind of the attack was, at that moment, so violently\nconcentrated upon Enjolras and upon the door of the wine-shop, that\nno one saw Jean Valjean sustaining the fainting Marius in his arms,\ntraverse the unpaved field of the barricade and disappear behind the\nangle of the Corinthe building.\n\nThe reader will recall this angle which formed a sort of cape on the\nstreet; it afforded shelter from the bullets, the grape-shot, and all\neyes, and a few square feet of space. There is sometimes a chamber\nwhich does not burn in the midst of a conflagration, and in the midst of\nraging seas, beyond a promontory or at the extremity of a blind alley\nof shoals, a tranquil nook. It was in this sort of fold in the interior\ntrapezium of the barricade, that Eponine had breathed her last.\n\nThere Jean Valjean halted, let Marius slide to the ground, placed his\nback against the wall, and cast his eyes about him.\n\nThe situation was alarming.\n\nFor an instant, for two or three perhaps, this bit of wall was a\nshelter, but how was he to escape from this massacre? He recalled the\nanguish which he had suffered in the Rue Polonceau eight years before,\nand in what manner he had contrived to make his escape; it was difficult\nthen, to-day it was impossible. He had before him that deaf and\nimplacable house, six stories in height, which appeared to be inhabited\nonly by a dead man leaning out of his window; he had on his right the\nrather low barricade, which shut off the Rue de la Petite Truanderie;\nto pass this obstacle seemed easy, but beyond the crest of the barrier a\nline of bayonets was visible. The troops of the line were posted on the\nwatch behind that barricade. It was evident, that to pass the barricade\nwas to go in quest of the fire of the platoon, and that any head which\nshould run the risk of lifting itself above the top of that wall of\nstones would serve as a target for sixty shots. On his left he had the\nfield of battle. Death lurked round the corner of that wall.\n\nWhat was to be done?\n\nOnly a bird could have extricated itself from this predicament.\n\nAnd it was necessary to decide on the instant, to devise some expedient,\nto come to some decision. Fighting was going on a few paces away;\nfortunately, all were raging around a single point, the door of the\nwine-shop; but if it should occur to one soldier, to one single soldier,\nto turn the corner of the house, or to attack him on the flank, all was\nover.\n\nJean Valjean gazed at the house facing him, he gazed at the barricade at\none side of him, then he looked at the ground, with the violence of the\nlast extremity, bewildered, and as though he would have liked to pierce\na hole there with his eyes.\n\nBy dint of staring, something vaguely striking in such an agony began\nto assume form and outline at his feet, as though it had been a power\nof glance which made the thing desired unfold. A few paces distant he\nperceived, at the base of the small barrier so pitilessly guarded and\nwatched on the exterior, beneath a disordered mass of paving-stones\nwhich partly concealed it, an iron grating, placed flat and on a level\nwith the soil. This grating, made of stout, transverse bars, was about\ntwo feet square. The frame of paving-stones which supported it had been\ntorn up, and it was, as it were, unfastened.\n\nThrough the bars a view could be had of a dark aperture, something like\nthe flue of a chimney, or the pipe of a cistern. Jean Valjean darted\nforward. His old art of escape rose to his brain like an illumination.\nTo thrust aside the stones, to raise the grating, to lift Marius, who\nwas as inert as a dead body, upon his shoulders, to descend, with this\nburden on his loins, and with the aid of his elbows and knees into that\nsort of well, fortunately not very deep, to let the heavy trap, upon\nwhich the loosened stones rolled down afresh, fall into its place behind\nhim, to gain his footing on a flagged surface three metres below the\nsurface,--all this was executed like that which one does in dreams, with\nthe strength of a giant and the rapidity of an eagle; this took only a\nfew minutes.\n\nJean Valjean found himself with Marius, who was still unconscious, in a\nsort of long, subterranean corridor.\n\nThere reigned profound peace, absolute silence, night.\n\nThe impression which he had formerly experienced when falling from the\nwall into the convent recurred to him. Only, what he was carrying to-day\nwas not Cosette; it was Marius. He could barely hear the formidable\ntumult in the wine-shop, taken by assault, like a vague murmur overhead.\n\n\n\n\nBOOK SECOND.--THE INTESTINE OF THE LEVIATHAN\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I--THE LAND IMPOVERISHED BY THE SEA\n\nParis casts twenty-five millions yearly into the water. And this without\nmetaphor. How, and in what manner? Day and night. With what object? With\nno object. With what intention? With no intention. Why? For no\nreason. By means of what organ? By means of its intestine. What is its\nintestine? The sewer.\n\nTwenty-five millions is the most moderate approximative figure which the\nvaluations of special science have set upon it.\n\nScience, after having long groped about, now knows that the most\nfecundating and the most efficacious of fertilizers is human manure.\nThe Chinese, let us confess it to our shame, knew it before us. Not\na Chinese peasant--it is Eckberg who says this,--goes to town without\nbringing back with him, at the two extremities of his bamboo pole, two\nfull buckets of what we designate as filth. Thanks to human dung, the\nearth in China is still as young as in the days of Abraham. Chinese\nwheat yields a hundred fold of the seed. There is no guano comparable\nin fertility with the detritus of a capital. A great city is the most\nmighty of dung-makers. Certain success would attend the experiment\nof employing the city to manure the plain. If our gold is manure, our\nmanure, on the other hand, is gold.\n\nWhat is done with this golden manure? It is swept into the abyss.\n\nFleets of vessels are despatched, at great expense, to collect the dung\nof petrels and penguins at the South Pole, and the incalculable element\nof opulence which we have on hand, we send to the sea. All the human and\nanimal manure which the world wastes, restored to the land instead of\nbeing cast into the water, would suffice to nourish the world.\n\nThose heaps of filth at the gate-posts, those tumbrils of mud which\njolt through the street by night, those terrible casks of the street\ndepartment, those fetid drippings of subterranean mire, which the\npavements hide from you,--do you know what they are? They are the meadow\nin flower, the green grass, wild thyme, thyme and sage, they are game,\nthey are cattle, they are the satisfied bellows of great oxen in the\nevening, they are perfumed hay, they are golden wheat, they are the\nbread on your table, they are the warm blood in your veins, they are\nhealth, they are joy, they are life. This is the will of that mysterious\ncreation which is transformation on earth and transfiguration in heaven.\n\nRestore this to the great crucible; your abundance will flow forth from\nit. The nutrition of the plains furnishes the nourishment of men.\n\nYou have it in your power to lose this wealth, and to consider me\nridiculous to boot. This will form the master-piece of your ignorance.\n\nStatisticians have calculated that France alone makes a deposit of\nhalf a milliard every year, in the Atlantic, through the mouths of her\nrivers. Note this: with five hundred millions we could pay one quarter\nof the expenses of our budget. The cleverness of man is such that he\nprefers to get rid of these five hundred millions in the gutter. It is\nthe very substance of the people that is carried off, here drop by\ndrop, there wave after wave, the wretched outpour of our sewers into the\nrivers, and the gigantic collection of our rivers into the ocean. Every\nhiccough of our sewers costs us a thousand francs. From this spring two\nresults, the land impoverished, and the water tainted. Hunger arising\nfrom the furrow, and disease from the stream.\n\nIt is notorious, for example, that at the present hour, the Thames is\npoisoning London.\n\nSo far as Paris is concerned, it has become indispensable of late, to\ntransport the mouths of the sewers down stream, below the last bridge.\n\nA double tubular apparatus, provided with valves and sluices, sucking up\nand driving back, a system of elementary drainage, simple as the lungs\nof a man, and which is already in full working order in many communities\nin England, would suffice to conduct the pure water of the fields into\nour cities, and to send back to the fields the rich water of the cities,\nand this easy exchange, the simplest in the world, would retain among us\nthe five hundred millions now thrown away. People are thinking of other\nthings.\n\nThe process actually in use does evil, with the intention of doing good.\nThe intention is good, the result is melancholy. Thinking to purge the\ncity, the population is blanched like plants raised in cellars. A sewer\nis a mistake. When drainage, everywhere, with its double function,\nrestoring what it takes, shall have replaced the sewer, which is a\nsimple impoverishing washing, then, this being combined with the data\nof a now social economy, the product of the earth will be increased\ntenfold, and the problem of misery will be singularly lightened. Add the\nsuppression of parasitism, and it will be solved.\n\nIn the meanwhile, the public wealth flows away to the river, and leakage\ntakes place. Leakage is the word. Europe is being ruined in this manner\nby exhaustion.\n\nAs for France, we have just cited its figures. Now, Paris contains one\ntwenty-fifth of the total population of France, and Parisian guano being\nthe richest of all, we understate the truth when we value the loss on\nthe part of Paris at twenty-five millions in the half milliard which\nFrance annually rejects. These twenty-five millions, employed in\nassistance and enjoyment, would double the splendor of Paris. The\ncity spends them in sewers. So that we may say that Paris's great\nprodigality, its wonderful festival, its Beaujon folly, its orgy, its\nstream of gold from full hands, its pomp, its luxury, its magnificence,\nis its sewer system.\n\nIt is in this manner that, in the blindness of a poor political economy,\nwe drown and allow to float down stream and to be lost in the gulfs the\nwell-being of all. There should be nets at Saint-Cloud for the public\nfortune.\n\nEconomically considered, the matter can be summed up thus: Paris is\na spendthrift. Paris, that model city, that patron of well-arranged\ncapitals, of which every nation strives to possess a copy, that\nmetropolis of the ideal, that august country of the initiative, of\nimpulse and of effort, that centre and that dwelling of minds, that\nnation-city, that hive of the future, that marvellous combination of\nBabylon and Corinth, would make a peasant of the Fo-Kian shrug his\nshoulders, from the point of view which we have just indicated.\n\nImitate Paris and you will ruin yourselves.\n\nMoreover, and particularly in this immemorial and senseless waste, Paris\nis itself an imitator.\n\nThese surprising exhibitions of stupidity are not novel; this is no\nyoung folly. The ancients did like the moderns. \"The sewers of Rome,\"\nsays Liebig, \"have absorbed all the well-being of the Roman peasant.\"\nWhen the Campagna of Rome was ruined by the Roman sewer, Rome exhausted\nItaly, and when she had put Italy in her sewer, she poured in Sicily,\nthen Sardinia, then Africa. The sewer of Rome has engulfed the world.\nThis cess-pool offered its engulfment to the city and the universe. Urbi\net orbi. Eternal city, unfathomable sewer.\n\nRome sets the example for these things as well as for others.\n\nParis follows this example with all the stupidity peculiar to\nintelligent towns.\n\nFor the requirements of the operation upon the subject of which we have\njust explained our views, Paris has beneath it another Paris; a Paris\nof sewers; which has its streets, its cross-roads, its squares, its\nblind-alleys, its arteries, and its circulation, which is of mire and\nminus the human form.\n\nFor nothing must be flattered, not even a great people; where there\nis everything there is also ignominy by the side of sublimity; and,\nif Paris contains Athens, the city of light, Tyre, the city of might,\nSparta, the city of virtue, Nineveh, the city of marvels, it also\ncontains Lutetia, the city of mud.\n\nHowever, the stamp of its power is there also, and the Titanic sink of\nParis realizes, among monuments, that strange ideal realized in humanity\nby some men like Macchiavelli, Bacon and Mirabeau, grandiose vileness.\n\nThe sub-soil of Paris, if the eye could penetrate its surface, would\npresent the aspect of a colossal madrepore. A sponge has no more\npartitions and ducts than the mound of earth for a circuit of six\nleagues round about, on which rests the great and ancient city. Not to\nmention its catacombs, which are a separate cellar, not to mention\nthe inextricable trellis-work of gas pipes, without reckoning the vast\ntubular system for the distribution of fresh water which ends in the\npillar fountains, the sewers alone form a tremendous, shadowy net-work\nunder the two banks; a labyrinth which has its slope for its guiding\nthread.\n\nThere appears, in the humid mist, the rat which seems the product to\nwhich Paris has given birth.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II--ANCIENT HISTORY OF THE SEWER\n\nLet the reader imagine Paris lifted off like a cover, the subterranean\nnet-work of sewers, from a bird's eye view, will outline on the banks\na species of large branch grafted on the river. On the right bank, the\nbelt sewer will form the trunk of this branch, the secondary ducts will\nform the branches, and those without exit the twigs.\n\nThis figure is but a summary one and half exact, the right angle, which\nis the customary angle of this species of subterranean ramifications,\nbeing very rare in vegetation.\n\nA more accurate image of this strange geometrical plan can be formed\nby supposing that one is viewing some eccentric oriental alphabet,\nas intricate as a thicket, against a background of shadows, and the\nmisshapen letters should be welded one to another in apparent confusion,\nand as at haphazard, now by their angles, again by their extremities.\n\nSinks and sewers played a great part in the Middle Ages, in the Lower\nEmpire and in the Orient of old. The masses regarded these beds of\ndecomposition, these monstrous cradles of death, with a fear that was\nalmost religious. The vermin ditch of Benares is no less conducive to\ngiddiness than the lions' ditch of Babylon. Teglath-Phalasar, according\nto the rabbinical books, swore by the sink of Nineveh. It was from the\nsewer of Munster that John of Leyden produced his false moon, and it\nwas from the cess-pool of Kekscheb that oriental menalchme, Mokanna, the\nveiled prophet of Khorassan, caused his false sun to emerge.\n\nThe history of men is reflected in the history of sewers. The\nGermoniae[58] narrated Rome. The sewer of Paris has been an ancient and\nformidable thing. It has been a sepulchre, it has served as an asylum.\nCrime, intelligence, social protest, liberty of conscience, thought,\ntheft, all that human laws persecute or have persecuted, is hidden in\nthat hole; the maillotins in the fourteenth century, the tire-laine of\nthe fifteenth, the Huguenots in the sixteenth, Morin's illuminated in\nthe seventeenth, the chauffeurs [brigands] in the eighteenth. A\nhundred years ago, the nocturnal blow of the dagger emerged thence, the\npickpocket in danger slipped thither; the forest had its cave, Paris had\nits sewer. Vagrancy, that Gallic picareria, accepted the sewer as the\nadjunct of the Cour des Miracles, and at evening, it returned thither,\nfierce and sly, through the Maubuee outlet, as into a bed-chamber.\n\nIt was quite natural, that those who had the blind-alley Vide-Gousset,\n[Empty-Pocket] or the Rue Coupe-Gorge [Cut-Throat], for the scene of\ntheir daily labor, should have for their domicile by night the culvert\nof the Chemin-Vert, or the catch basin of Hurepoix. Hence a throng of\nsouvenirs. All sorts of phantoms haunt these long, solitary\ncorridors; everywhere is putrescence and miasma; here and there are\nbreathing-holes, where Villon within converses with Rabelais without.\n\nThe sewer in ancient Paris is the rendezvous of all exhaustions and\nof all attempts. Political economy therein spies a detritus, social\nphilosophy there beholds a residuum.\n\nThe sewer is the conscience of the city. Everything there converges\nand confronts everything else. In that livid spot there are shades, but\nthere are no longer any secrets. Each thing bears its true form, or at\nleast, its definitive form. The mass of filth has this in its favor,\nthat it is not a liar. Ingenuousness has taken refuge there. The mask\nof Basil is to be found there, but one beholds its cardboard and its\nstrings and the inside as well as the outside, and it is accentuated\nby honest mud. Scapin's false nose is its next-door neighbor. All the\nuncleannesses of civilization, once past their use, fall into this\ntrench of truth, where the immense social sliding ends. They are\nthere engulfed, but they display themselves there. This mixture is a\nconfession. There, no more false appearances, no plastering over is\npossible, filth removes its shirt, absolute denudation puts to the rout\nall illusions and mirages, there is nothing more except what really\nexists, presenting the sinister form of that which is coming to an end.\nThere, the bottom of a bottle indicates drunkenness, a basket-handle\ntells a tale of domesticity; there the core of an apple which has\nentertained literary opinions becomes an apple-core once more; the\neffigy on the big sou becomes frankly covered with verdigris, Caiphas'\nspittle meets Falstaff's puking, the louis-d'or which comes from\nthe gaming-house jostles the nail whence hangs the rope's end of the\nsuicide. A livid foetus rolls along, enveloped in the spangles which\ndanced at the Opera last Shrove-Tuesday, a cap which has pronounced\njudgment on men wallows beside a mass of rottenness which was formerly\nMargoton's petticoat; it is more than fraternization, it is equivalent\nto addressing each other as thou. All which was formerly rouged, is\nwashed free. The last veil is torn away. A sewer is a cynic. It tells\neverything.\n\nThe sincerity of foulness pleases us, and rests the soul. When one has\npassed one's time in enduring upon earth the spectacle of the great airs\nwhich reasons of state, the oath, political sagacity, human justice,\nprofessional probity, the austerities of situation, incorruptible robes\nall assume, it solaces one to enter a sewer and to behold the mire which\nbefits it.\n\nThis is instructive at the same time. We have just said that history\npasses through the sewer. The Saint-Barthelemys filter through there,\ndrop by drop, between the paving-stones. Great public assassinations,\npolitical and religious butcheries, traverse this underground passage\nof civilization, and thrust their corpses there. For the eye of the\nthinker, all historic murderers are to be found there, in that hideous\npenumbra, on their knees, with a scrap of their winding-sheet for\nan apron, dismally sponging out their work. Louis XI. is there with\nTristan, Francois I. with Duprat, Charles IX. is there with his mother,\nRichelieu is there with Louis XIII., Louvois is there, Letellier is\nthere, Hebert and Maillard are there, scratching the stones, and trying\nto make the traces of their actions disappear. Beneath these vaults one\nhears the brooms of spectres. One there breathes the enormous fetidness\nof social catastrophes. One beholds reddish reflections in the corners.\nThere flows a terrible stream, in which bloody hands have been washed.\n\nThe social observer should enter these shadows. They form a part of\nhis laboratory. Philosophy is the microscope of the thought. Everything\ndesires to flee from it, but nothing escapes it. Tergiversation is\nuseless. What side of oneself does one display in evasions? the shameful\nside. Philosophy pursues with its glance, probes the evil, and does\nnot permit it to escape into nothingness. In the obliteration of things\nwhich disappear, in the watching of things which vanish, it recognizes\nall. It reconstructs the purple from the rag, and the woman from the\nscrap of her dress. From the cess-pool, it re-constitutes the city; from\nmud, it reconstructs manners; from the potsherd it infers the amphora\nor the jug. By the imprint of a finger-nail on a piece of parchment, it\nrecognizes the difference which separates the Jewry of the Judengasse\nfrom the Jewry of the Ghetto. It re-discovers in what remains that\nwhich has been, good, evil, the true, the blood-stain of the palace,\nthe ink-blot of the cavern, the drop of sweat from the brothel, trials\nundergone, temptations welcomed, orgies cast forth, the turn which\ncharacters have taken as they became abased, the trace of prostitution\nin souls of which their grossness rendered them capable, and on the\nvesture of the porters of Rome the mark of Messalina's elbowing.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III--BRUNESEAU\n\nThe sewer of Paris in the Middle Ages was legendary. In the sixteenth\ncentury, Henri II. attempted a bore, which failed. Not a hundred years\nago, the cess-pool, Mercier attests the fact, was abandoned to itself,\nand fared as best it might.\n\nSuch was this ancient Paris, delivered over to quarrels, to indecision,\nand to gropings. It was tolerably stupid for a long time. Later on, '89\nshowed how understanding comes to cities. But in the good, old times,\nthe capital had not much head. It did not know how to manage its own\naffairs either morally or materially, and could not sweep out filth\nany better than it could abuses. Everything presented an obstacle,\neverything raised a question. The sewer, for example, was refractory to\nevery itinerary. One could no more find one's bearings in the sewer\nthan one could understand one's position in the city; above the\nunintelligible, below the inextricable; beneath the confusion of tongues\nthere reigned the confusion of caverns; Daedalus backed up Babel.\n\nSometimes the Paris sewer took a notion to overflow, as though this\nmisunderstood Nile were suddenly seized with a fit of rage. There\noccurred, infamous to relate, inundations of the sewer. At times, that\nstomach of civilization digested badly, the cess-pool flowed back into\nthe throat of the city, and Paris got an after-taste of her own filth.\nThese resemblances of the sewer to remorse had their good points; they\nwere warnings; very badly accepted, however; the city waxed indignant\nat the audacity of its mire, and did not admit that the filth should\nreturn. Drive it out better.\n\nThe inundation of 1802 is one of the actual memories of Parisians of\nthe age of eighty. The mud spread in cross-form over the Place des\nVictoires, where stands the statue of Louis XIV.; it entered the Rue\nSaint-Honore by the two mouths to the sewer in the Champs-Elysees,\nthe Rue Saint-Florentin through the Saint-Florentin sewer, the Rue\nPierre-a-Poisson through the sewer de la Sonnerie, the Rue Popincourt,\nthrough the sewer of the Chemin-Vert, the Rue de la Roquette, through\nthe sewer of the Rue de Lappe; it covered the drain of the Rue des\nChamps-Elysees to the height of thirty-five centimetres; and, to the\nSouth, through the vent of the Seine, performing its functions in\ninverse sense, it penetrated the Rue Mazarine, the Rue de l'Echaude, and\nthe Rue des Marais, where it stopped at a distance of one hundred and\nnine metres, a few paces distant from the house in which Racine had\nlived, respecting, in the seventeenth century, the poet more than the\nKing. It attained its maximum depth in the Rue Saint-Pierre, where\nit rose to the height of three feet above the flag-stones of the\nwater-spout, and its maximum length in the Rue Saint-Sabin, where it\nspread out over a stretch two hundred and thirty-eight metres in length.\n\nAt the beginning of this century, the sewer of Paris was still a\nmysterious place. Mud can never enjoy a good fame; but in this case its\nevil renown reached the verge of the terrible. Paris knew, in a confused\nway, that she had under her a terrible cavern. People talked of it as\nof that monstrous bed of Thebes in which swarmed centipedes fifteen long\nfeet in length, and which might have served Behemoth for a bathtub.\nThe great boots of the sewermen never ventured further than certain\nwell-known points. We were then very near the epoch when the scavenger's\ncarts, from the summit of which Sainte-Foix fraternized with the Marquis\nde Crequi, discharged their loads directly into the sewer. As for\ncleaning out,--that function was entrusted to the pouring rains which\nencumbered rather than swept away. Rome left some poetry to her sewer,\nand called it the Gemoniae; Paris insulted hers, and entitled it the\nPolypus-Hole. Science and superstition were in accord, in horror. The\nPolypus hole was no less repugnant to hygiene than to legend. The goblin\nwas developed under the fetid covering of the Mouffetard sewer; the\ncorpses of the Marmousets had been cast into the sewer de la Barillerie;\nFagon attributed the redoubtable malignant fever of 1685 to the great\nhiatus of the sewer of the Marais, which remained yawning until 1833 in\nthe Rue Saint-Louis, almost opposite the sign of the Gallant Messenger.\nThe mouth of the sewer of the Rue de la Mortellerie was celebrated for\nthe pestilences which had their source there; with its grating of iron,\nwith points simulating a row of teeth, it was like a dragon's maw\nin that fatal street, breathing forth hell upon men. The popular\nimagination seasoned the sombre Parisian sink with some indescribably\nhideous intermixture of the infinite. The sewer had no bottom. The sewer\nwas the lower world. The idea of exploring these leprous regions did not\neven occur to the police. To try that unknown thing, to cast the plummet\ninto that shadow, to set out on a voyage of discovery in that abyss--who\nwould have dared? It was alarming. Nevertheless, some one did present\nhimself. The cess-pool had its Christopher Columbus.\n\nOne day, in 1805, during one of the rare apparitions which the Emperor\nmade in Paris, the Minister of the Interior, some Decres or Cretet or\nother, came to the master's intimate levee. In the Carrousel there was\naudible the clanking of swords of all those extraordinary soldiers of\nthe great Republic, and of the great Empire; then Napoleon's door was\nblocked with heroes; men from the Rhine, from the Escaut, from the\nAdige, and from the Nile; companions of Joubert, of Desaix, of Marceau,\nof Hoche, of Kleber; the aerostiers of Fleurus, the grenadiers of\nMayence, the pontoon-builders of Genoa, hussars whom the Pyramids had\nlooked down upon, artillerists whom Junot's cannon-ball had spattered\nwith mud, cuirassiers who had taken by assault the fleet lying at anchor\nin the Zuyderzee; some had followed Bonaparte upon the bridge of Lodi,\nothers had accompanied Murat in the trenches of Mantua, others had\npreceded Lannes in the hollow road of Montebello. The whole army of that\nday was present there, in the court-yard of the Tuileries, represented\nby a squadron or a platoon, and guarding Napoleon in repose; and that\nwas the splendid epoch when the grand army had Marengo behind it and\nAusterlitz before it.--\"Sire,\" said the Minister of the Interior to\nNapoleon, \"yesterday I saw the most intrepid man in your Empire.\"--\"What\nman is that?\" said the Emperor brusquely, \"and what has he done?\"--\"He\nwants to do something, Sire.\"--\"What is it?\"--\"To visit the sewers of\nParis.\"\n\nThis man existed and his name was Bruneseau.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV--BRUNESEAU.\n\nThe visit took place. It was a formidable campaign; a nocturnal battle\nagainst pestilence and suffocation. It was, at the same time, a voyage\nof discovery. One of the survivors of this expedition, an intelligent\nworkingman, who was very young at the time, related curious details with\nregard to it, several years ago, which Bruneseau thought himself obliged\nto omit in his report to the prefect of police, as unworthy of official\nstyle. The processes of disinfection were, at that epoch, extremely\nrudimentary. Hardly had Bruneseau crossed the first articulations of\nthat subterranean network, when eight laborers out of the twenty refused\nto go any further. The operation was complicated; the visit entailed the\nnecessity of cleaning; hence it was necessary to cleanse and at the same\ntime, to proceed; to note the entrances of water, to count the gratings\nand the vents, to lay out in detail the branches, to indicate the\ncurrents at the point where they parted, to define the respective bounds\nof the divers basins, to sound the small sewers grafted on the principal\nsewer, to measure the height under the key-stone of each drain, and the\nwidth, at the spring of the vaults as well as at the bottom, in order\nto determine the arrangements with regard to the level of each\nwater-entrance, either of the bottom of the arch, or on the soil of the\nstreet. They advanced with toil. The lanterns pined away in the foul\natmosphere. From time to time, a fainting sewerman was carried out.\nAt certain points, there were precipices. The soil had given away, the\npavement had crumbled, the sewer had changed into a bottomless well;\nthey found nothing solid; a man disappeared suddenly; they had great\ndifficulty in getting him out again. On the advice of Fourcroy, they\nlighted large cages filled with tow steeped in resin, from time to time,\nin spots which had been sufficiently disinfected. In some places, the\nwall was covered with misshapen fungi,--one would have said tumors; the\nvery stone seemed diseased within this unbreathable atmosphere.\n\nBruneseau, in his exploration, proceeded down hill. At the point of\nseparation of the two water-conduits of the Grand-Hurleur, he deciphered\nupon a projecting stone the date of 1550; this stone indicated the\nlimits where Philibert Delorme, charged by Henri II. with visiting the\nsubterranean drains of Paris, had halted. This stone was the mark of\nthe sixteenth century on the sewer; Bruneseau found the handiwork of\nthe seventeenth century once more in the Ponceau drain of the old Rue\nVielle-du-Temple, vaulted between 1600 and 1650; and the handiwork of\nthe eighteenth in the western section of the collecting canal, walled\nand vaulted in 1740. These two vaults, especially the less ancient, that\nof 1740, were more cracked and decrepit than the masonry of the belt\nsewer, which dated from 1412, an epoch when the brook of fresh water of\nMenilmontant was elevated to the dignity of the Grand Sewer of Paris, an\nadvancement analogous to that of a peasant who should become first valet\nde chambre to the King; something like Gros-Jean transformed into Lebel.\n\nHere and there, particularly beneath the Court-House, they thought they\nrecognized the hollows of ancient dungeons, excavated in the very sewer\nitself. Hideous place! An iron neck-collar was hanging in one of these\ncells. They walled them all up. Some of their finds were singular; among\nothers, the skeleton of an ourang-outan, who had disappeared from the\nJardin des Plantes in 1800, a disappearance probably connected with\nthe famous and indisputable apparition of the devil in the Rue des\nBernardins, in the last year of the eighteenth century. The poor devil\nhad ended by drowning himself in the sewer.\n\nBeneath this long, arched drain which terminated at the Arche-Marion,\na perfectly preserved rag-picker's basket excited the admiration of all\nconnoisseurs. Everywhere, the mire, which the sewermen came to handle\nwith intrepidity, abounded in precious objects, jewels of gold and\nsilver, precious stones, coins. If a giant had filtered this cesspool,\nhe would have had the riches of centuries in his lair. At the point\nwhere the two branches of the Rue du Temple and of the Rue Sainte-Avoye\nseparate, they picked up a singular Huguenot medal in copper, bearing on\none side the pig hooded with a cardinal's hat, and on the other, a wolf\nwith a tiara on his head.\n\nThe most surprising encounter was at the entrance to the Grand Sewer.\nThis entrance had formerly been closed by a grating of which nothing but\nthe hinges remained. From one of these hinges hung a dirty and shapeless\nrag which, arrested there in its passage, no doubt, had floated there\nin the darkness and finished its process of being torn apart. Bruneseau\nheld his lantern close to this rag and examined it. It was of very fine\nbatiste, and in one of the corners, less frayed than the rest, they\nmade out a heraldic coronet and embroidered above these seven letters:\nLAVBESP. The crown was the coronet of a Marquis, and the seven letters\nsignified Laubespine. They recognized the fact, that what they had\nbefore their eyes was a morsel of the shroud of Marat. Marat in his\nyouth had had amorous intrigues. This was when he was a member of the\nhousehold of the Comte d'Artois, in the capacity of physician to the\nStables. From these love affairs, historically proved, with a great\nlady, he had retained this sheet. As a waif or a souvenir. At his death,\nas this was the only linen of any fineness which he had in his house,\nthey buried him in it. Some old women had shrouded him for the tomb in\nthat swaddling-band in which the tragic Friend of the people had enjoyed\nvoluptuousness. Bruneseau passed on. They left that rag where it hung;\nthey did not put the finishing touch to it. Did this arise from scorn\nor from respect? Marat deserved both. And then, destiny was there\nsufficiently stamped to make them hesitate to touch it. Besides, the\nthings of the sepulchre must be left in the spot which they select. In\nshort, the relic was a strange one. A Marquise had slept in it; Marat\nhad rotted in it; it had traversed the Pantheon to end with the rats\nof the sewer. This chamber rag, of which Watteau would formerly have\njoyfully sketched every fold, had ended in becoming worthy of the fixed\ngaze of Dante.\n\nThe whole visit to the subterranean stream of filth of Paris lasted\nseven years, from 1805 to 1812. As he proceeded, Bruneseau drew,\ndirected, and completed considerable works; in 1808 he lowered the arch\nof the Ponceau, and, everywhere creating new lines, he pushed the\nsewer, in 1809, under the Rue Saint-Denis as far as the fountain of\nthe Innocents; in 1810, under the Rue Froidmanteau and under the\nSalpetriere; in 1811 under the Rue Neuve-des-Petits-Peres, under the Rue\ndu Mail, under the Rue de l'Echarpe, under the Place Royale; in 1812,\nunder the Rue de la Paix, and under the Chaussee d'Antin. At the same\ntime, he had the whole net-work disinfected and rendered healthful. In\nthe second year of his work, Bruneseau engaged the assistance of his\nson-in-law Nargaud.\n\nIt was thus that, at the beginning of the century, ancient society\ncleansed its double bottom, and performed the toilet of its sewer. There\nwas that much clean, at all events.\n\nTortuous, cracked, unpaved, full of fissures, intersected by gullies,\njolted by eccentric elbows, mounting and descending illogically, fetid,\nwild, fierce, submerged in obscurity, with cicatrices on its pavements\nand scars on its walls, terrible,--such was, retrospectively viewed, the\nantique sewer of Paris. Ramifications in every direction, crossings,\nof trenches, branches, goose-feet, stars, as in military mines, coecum,\nblind alleys, vaults lined with saltpetre, pestiferous pools, scabby\nsweats, on the walls, drops dripping from the ceilings, darkness;\nnothing could equal the horror of this old, waste crypt, the digestive\napparatus of Babylon, a cavern, ditch, gulf pierced with streets, a\ntitanic mole-burrow, where the mind seems to behold that enormous blind\nmole, the past, prowling through the shadows, in the filth which has\nbeen splendor.\n\nThis, we repeat, was the sewer of the past.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V--PRESENT PROGRESS\n\nTo-day the sewer is clean, cold, straight, correct. It almost realizes\nthe ideal of what is understood in England by the word \"respectable.\" It\nis proper and grayish; laid out by rule and line; one might almost say\nas though it came out of a bandbox. It resembles a tradesman who has\nbecome a councillor of state. One can almost see distinctly there. The\nmire there comports itself with decency. At first, one might readily\nmistake it for one of those subterranean corridors, which were so common\nin former days, and so useful in flights of monarchs and princes, in\nthose good old times, \"when the people loved their kings.\" The present\nsewer is a beautiful sewer; the pure style reigns there; the classical\nrectilinear alexandrine which, driven out of poetry, appears to have\ntaken refuge in architecture, seems mingled with all the stones of\nthat long, dark and whitish vault; each outlet is an arcade; the Rue de\nRivoli serves as pattern even in the sewer. However, if the geometrical\nline is in place anywhere, it is certainly in the drainage trench of\na great city. There, everything should be subordinated to the shortest\nroad. The sewer has, nowadays, assumed a certain official aspect. The\nvery police reports, of which it sometimes forms the subject, no longer\nare wanting in respect towards it. The words which characterize it in\nadministrative language are sonorous and dignified. What used to be\ncalled a gut is now called a gallery; what used to be called a hole is\nnow called a surveying orifice. Villon would no longer meet with his\nancient temporary provisional lodging. This net-work of cellars has its\nimmemorial population of prowlers, rodents, swarming in greater numbers\nthan ever; from time to time, an aged and veteran rat risks his head at\nthe window of the sewer and surveys the Parisians; but even these vermin\ngrow tame, so satisfied are they with their subterranean palace. The\ncesspool no longer retains anything of its primitive ferocity. The rain,\nwhich in former days soiled the sewer, now washes it. Nevertheless, do\nnot trust yourself too much to it. Miasmas still inhabit it. It is\nmore hypocritical than irreproachable. The prefecture of police and\nthe commission of health have done their best. But, in spite of all the\nprocesses of disinfection, it exhales, a vague, suspicious odor like\nTartuffe after confession.\n\nLet us confess, that, taking it all in all, this sweeping is a homage\nwhich the sewer pays to civilization, and as, from this point of view,\nTartuffe's conscience is a progress over the Augean stables, it is\ncertain that the sewers of Paris have been improved.\n\nIt is more than progress; it is transmutation. Between the ancient\nand the present sewer there is a revolution. What has effected this\nrevolution?\n\nThe man whom all the world forgets, and whom we have mentioned,\nBruneseau.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI--FUTURE PROGRESS\n\nThe excavation of the sewer of Paris has been no slight task. The last\nten centuries have toiled at it without being able to bring it to a\ntermination, any more than they have been able to finish Paris. The\nsewer, in fact, receives all the counter-shocks of the growth of Paris.\nWithin the bosom of the earth, it is a sort of mysterious polyp with a\nthousand antennae, which expands below as the city expands above. Every\ntime that the city cuts a street, the sewer stretches out an arm. The\nold monarchy had constructed only twenty-three thousand three hundred\nmetres of sewers; that was where Paris stood in this respect on the\nfirst of January, 1806. Beginning with this epoch, of which we shall\nshortly speak, the work was usefully and energetically resumed and\nprosecuted; Napoleon built--the figures are curious--four thousand eight\nhundred and four metres; Louis XVIII., five thousand seven hundred\nand nine; Charles X., ten thousand eight hundred and thirty-six;\nLouis-Philippe, eighty-nine thousand and twenty; the Republic of\n1848, twenty-three thousand three hundred and eighty-one; the present\ngovernment, seventy thousand five hundred; in all, at the present time,\ntwo hundred and twenty-six thousand six hundred and ten metres;\nsixty leagues of sewers; the enormous entrails of Paris. An obscure\nramification ever at work; a construction which is immense and ignored.\n\nAs the reader sees, the subterranean labyrinth of Paris is to-day\nmore than ten times what it was at the beginning of the century. It is\ndifficult to form any idea of all the perseverance and the efforts which\nhave been required to bring this cess-pool to the point of relative\nperfection in which it now is. It was with great difficulty that the\nancient monarchical provostship and, during the last ten years of\nthe eighteenth century, the revolutionary mayoralty, had succeeded in\nperforating the five leagues of sewer which existed previous to 1806.\nAll sorts of obstacles hindered this operation, some peculiar to the\nsoil, others inherent in the very prejudices of the laborious population\nof Paris. Paris is built upon a soil which is singularly rebellious to\nthe pick, the hoe, the bore, and to human manipulation. There is nothing\nmore difficult to pierce and to penetrate than the geological formation\nupon which is superposed the marvellous historical formation called\nParis; as soon as work in any form whatsoever is begun and adventures\nupon this stretch of alluvium, subterranean resistances abound. There\nare liquid clays, springs, hard rocks, and those soft and deep quagmires\nwhich special science calls moutardes.[59] The pick advances laboriously\nthrough the calcareous layers alternating with very slender threads of\nclay, and schistose beds in plates incrusted with oyster-shells, the\ncontemporaries of the pre-Adamite oceans. Sometimes a rivulet suddenly\nbursts through a vault that has been begun, and inundates the laborers;\nor a layer of marl is laid bare, and rolls down with the fury of a\ncataract, breaking the stoutest supporting beams like glass. Quite\nrecently, at Villette, when it became necessary to pass the collecting\nsewer under the Saint-Martin canal without interrupting navigation or\nemptying the canal, a fissure appeared in the basin of the canal, water\nsuddenly became abundant in the subterranean tunnel, which was beyond\nthe power of the pumping engines; it was necessary to send a diver to\nexplore the fissure which had been made in the narrow entrance of the\ngrand basin, and it was not without great difficulty that it was stopped\nup. Elsewhere near the Seine, and even at a considerable distance\nfrom the river, as for instance, at Belleville, Grand-Rue and Lumiere\nPassage, quicksands are encountered in which one sticks fast, and in\nwhich a man sinks visibly. Add suffocation by miasmas, burial by slides,\nand sudden crumbling of the earth. Add the typhus, with which the\nworkmen become slowly impregnated. In our own day, after having\nexcavated the gallery of Clichy, with a banquette to receive the\nprincipal water-conduit of Ourcq, a piece of work which was executed in\na trench ten metres deep; after having, in the midst of land-slides, and\nwith the aid of excavations often putrid, and of shoring up, vaulted\nthe Bievre from the Boulevard de l'Hopital, as far as the Seine; after\nhaving, in order to deliver Paris from the floods of Montmartre and in\norder to provide an outlet for that river-like pool nine hectares in\nextent, which crouched near the Barriere des Martyrs, after having, let\nus state, constructed the line of sewers from the Barriere Blanche to\nthe road of Aubervilliers, in four months, working day and night, at a\ndepth of eleven metres; after having--a thing heretofore unseen--made a\nsubterranean sewer in the Rue Barre-du-Bec, without a trench, six\nmetres below the surface, the superintendent, Monnot, died. After having\nvaulted three thousand metres of sewer in all quarters of the city, from\nthe Rue Traversiere-Saint-Antoine to the Rue de l'Ourcine, after having\nfreed the Carrefour Censier-Mouffetard from inundations of rain by means\nof the branch of the Arbalete, after having built the Saint-Georges\nsewer, on rock and concrete in the fluid sands, after having directed\nthe formidable lowering of the flooring of the vault timber in the\nNotre-Dame-de-Nazareth branch, Duleau the engineer died. There are no\nbulletins for such acts of bravery as these, which are more useful,\nnevertheless, than the brutal slaughter of the field of battle.\n\nThe sewers of Paris in 1832 were far from being what they are to-day.\nBruneseau had given the impulse, but the cholera was required to\nbring about the vast reconstruction which took place later on. It is\nsurprising to say, for example, that in 1821, a part of the belt sewer,\ncalled the Grand Canal, as in Venice, still stood stagnating uncovered\nto the sky, in the Rue des Gourdes. It was only in 1821 that the city\nof Paris found in its pocket the two hundred and sixty-thousand eighty\nfrancs and six centimes required for covering this mass of filth. The\nthree absorbing wells, of the Combat, the Cunette, and Saint-Mande, with\ntheir discharging mouths, their apparatus, their cesspools, and their\ndepuratory branches, only date from 1836. The intestinal sewer of Paris\nhas been made over anew, and, as we have said, it has been extended more\nthan tenfold within the last quarter of a century.\n\nThirty years ago, at the epoch of the insurrection of the 5th and 6th of\nJune, it was still, in many localities, nearly the same ancient sewer.\nA very great number of streets which are now convex were then sunken\ncauseways. At the end of a slope, where the tributaries of a street or\ncross-roads ended, there were often to be seen large, square gratings\nwith heavy bars, whose iron, polished by the footsteps of the throng,\ngleamed dangerous and slippery for vehicles, and caused horses to fall.\nThe official language of the Roads and Bridges gave to these gratings\nthe expressive name of Cassis.[60]\n\nIn 1832, in a number of streets, in the Rue de l'Etoile, the Rue\nSaint-Louis, the Rue du Temple, the Rue Vielle-duTemple, the Rue\nNotre-Dame de Nazareth, the Rue Folie-Mericourt, the Quai aux Fleurs,\nthe Rue du Petit-Muse, the Rue du Normandie, the Rue Pont-Aux-Biches,\nthe Rue des Marais, the Faubourg Saint-Martin, the Rue Notre Dame\ndes-Victoires, the Faubourg Montmartre, the Rue Grange-Bateliere, in the\nChamps-Elysees, the Rue Jacob, the Rue de Tournon, the ancient gothic\nsewer still cynically displayed its maw. It consisted of enormous\nvoids of stone catch-basins sometimes surrounded by stone posts, with\nmonumental effrontery.\n\nParis in 1806 still had nearly the same sewers numerically as stated in\n1663; five thousand three hundred fathoms. After Bruneseau, on the 1st\nof January, 1832, it had forty thousand three hundred metres. Between\n1806 and 1831, there had been built, on an average, seven hundred and\nfifty metres annually, afterwards eight and even ten thousand metres of\ngalleries were constructed every year, in masonry, of small stones, with\nhydraulic mortar which hardens under water, on a cement foundation. At\ntwo hundred francs the metre, the sixty leagues of Paris' sewers of the\npresent day represent forty-eight millions.\n\nIn addition to the economic progress which we have indicated at the\nbeginning, grave problems of public hygiene are connected with that\nimmense question: the sewers of Paris.\n\nParis is the centre of two sheets, a sheet of water and a sheet of air.\nThe sheet of water, lying at a tolerably great depth underground, but\nalready sounded by two bores, is furnished by the layer of green clay\nsituated between the chalk and the Jurassic lime-stone; this layer may\nbe represented by a disk five and twenty leagues in circumference; a\nmultitude of rivers and brooks ooze there; one drinks the Seine, the\nMarne, the Yonne, the Oise, the Aisne, the Cher, the Vienne and the\nLoire in a glass of water from the well of Grenelle. The sheet of water\nis healthy, it comes from heaven in the first place and next from the\nearth; the sheet of air is unhealthy, it comes from the sewer. All the\nmiasms of the cess-pool are mingled with the breath of the city; hence\nthis bad breath. The air taken from above a dung-heap, as has been\nscientifically proved, is purer than the air taken from above Paris. In\na given time, with the aid of progress, mechanisms become perfected, and\nas light increases, the sheet of water will be employed to purify the\nsheet of air; that is to say, to wash the sewer. The reader knows, that\nby \"washing the sewer\" we mean: the restitution of the filth to the\nearth; the return to the soil of dung and of manure to the fields.\nThrough this simple act, the entire social community will experience a\ndiminution of misery and an augmentation of health. At the present hour,\nthe radiation of diseases from Paris extends to fifty leagues around the\nLouvre, taken as the hub of this pestilential wheel.\n\nWe might say that, for ten centuries, the cess-pool has been the disease\nof Paris. The sewer is the blemish which Paris has in her blood. The\npopular instinct has never been deceived in it. The occupation of\nsewermen was formerly almost as perilous, and almost as repugnant to the\npeople, as the occupation of knacker, which was so long held in horror\nand handed over to the executioner. High wages were necessary to induce\na mason to disappear in that fetid mine; the ladder of the cess-pool\ncleaner hesitated to plunge into it; it was said, in proverbial form:\n\"to descend into the sewer is to enter the grave;\" and all sorts of\nhideous legends, as we have said, covered this colossal sink with\nterror; a dread sink-hole which bears the traces of the revolutions\nof the globe as of the revolutions of man, and where are to be found\nvestiges of all cataclysms from the shells of the Deluge to the rag of\nMarat.\n\n\n\n\nBOOK THIRD.--MUD BUT THE SOUL\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I--THE SEWER AND ITS SURPRISES\n\nIt was in the sewers of Paris that Jean Valjean found himself.\n\nStill another resemblance between Paris and the sea. As in the ocean,\nthe diver may disappear there.\n\nThe transition was an unheard-of one. In the very heart of the city,\nJean Valjean had escaped from the city, and, in the twinkling of an eye,\nin the time required to lift the cover and to replace it, he had passed\nfrom broad daylight to complete obscurity, from midday to midnight, from\ntumult to silence, from the whirlwind of thunders to the stagnation of\nthe tomb, and, by a vicissitude far more tremendous even than that of\nthe Rue Polonceau, from the most extreme peril to the most absolute\nobscurity.\n\nAn abrupt fall into a cavern; a disappearance into the secret trap-door\nof Paris; to quit that street where death was on every side, for that\nsort of sepulchre where there was life, was a strange instant. He\nremained for several seconds as though bewildered; listening, stupefied.\nThe waste-trap of safety had suddenly yawned beneath him. Celestial\ngoodness had, in a manner, captured him by treachery. Adorable\nambuscades of providence!\n\nOnly, the wounded man did not stir, and Jean Valjean did not know\nwhether that which he was carrying in that grave was a living being or a\ndead corpse.\n\nHis first sensation was one of blindness. All of a sudden, he could see\nnothing. It seemed to him too, that, in one instant, he had become deaf.\nHe no longer heard anything. The frantic storm of murder which had been\nlet loose a few feet above his head did not reach him, thanks to the\nthickness of the earth which separated him from it, as we have said,\notherwise than faintly and indistinctly, and like a rumbling, in the\ndepths. He felt that the ground was solid under his feet; that was all;\nbut that was enough. He extended one arm and then the other, touched\nthe walls on both sides, and perceived that the passage was narrow; he\nslipped, and thus perceived that the pavement was wet. He cautiously put\nforward one foot, fearing a hole, a sink, some gulf; he discovered that\nthe paving continued. A gust of fetidness informed him of the place in\nwhich he stood.\n\nAfter the lapse of a few minutes, he was no longer blind. A little light\nfell through the man-hole through which he had descended, and his eyes\nbecame accustomed to this cavern. He began to distinguish something. The\npassage in which he had burrowed--no other word can better express the\nsituation--was walled in behind him. It was one of those blind alleys,\nwhich the special jargon terms branches. In front of him there was\nanother wall, a wall like night. The light of the air-hole died out ten\nor twelve paces from the point where Jean Valjean stood, and barely cast\na wan pallor on a few metres of the damp walls of the sewer. Beyond,\nthe opaqueness was massive; to penetrate thither seemed horrible, an\nentrance into it appeared like an engulfment. A man could, however,\nplunge into that wall of fog and it was necessary so to do. Haste was\neven requisite. It occurred to Jean Valjean that the grating which he\nhad caught sight of under the flag-stones might also catch the eye of\nthe soldiery, and that everything hung upon this chance. They also might\ndescend into that well and search it. There was not a minute to be lost.\nHe had deposited Marius on the ground, he picked him up again,--that is\nthe real word for it,--placed him on his shoulders once more, and set\nout. He plunged resolutely into the gloom.\n\nThe truth is, that they were less safe than Jean Valjean fancied. Perils\nof another sort and no less serious were awaiting them, perchance. After\nthe lightning-charged whirlwind of the combat, the cavern of miasmas and\ntraps; after chaos, the sewer. Jean Valjean had fallen from one circle\nof hell into another.\n\nWhen he had advanced fifty paces, he was obliged to halt. A problem\npresented itself. The passage terminated in another gut which he\nencountered across his path. There two ways presented themselves. Which\nshould he take? Ought he to turn to the left or to the right? How was he\nto find his bearings in that black labyrinth? This labyrinth, to which\nwe have already called the reader's attention, has a clue, which is its\nslope. To follow to the slope is to arrive at the river.\n\nThis Jean Valjean instantly comprehended.\n\nHe said to himself that he was probably in the sewer des Halles; that\nif he were to choose the path to the left and follow the slope, he would\narrive, in less than a quarter of an hour, at some mouth on the Seine\nbetween the Pont au Change and the Pont-Neuf, that is to say, he would\nmake his appearance in broad daylight on the most densely peopled spot\nin Paris. Perhaps he would come out on some man-hole at the intersection\nof streets. Amazement of the passers-by at beholding two bleeding men\nemerge from the earth at their feet. Arrival of the police, a call to\narms of the neighboring post of guards. Thus they would be seized before\nthey had even got out. It would be better to plunge into that labyrinth,\nto confide themselves to that black gloom, and to trust to Providence\nfor the outcome.\n\nHe ascended the incline, and turned to the right.\n\nWhen he had turned the angle of the gallery, the distant glimmer of an\nair-hole disappeared, the curtain of obscurity fell upon him once more,\nand he became blind again. Nevertheless, he advanced as rapidly as\npossible. Marius' two arms were passed round his neck, and the former's\nfeet dragged behind him. He held both these arms with one hand, and\ngroped along the wall with the other. Marius' cheek touched his, and\nclung there, bleeding. He felt a warm stream which came from Marius\ntrickling down upon him and making its way under his clothes. But a\nhumid warmth near his ear, which the mouth of the wounded man touched,\nindicated respiration, and consequently, life. The passage along which\nJean Valjean was now proceeding was not so narrow as the first. Jean\nValjean walked through it with considerable difficulty. The rain of the\npreceding day had not, as yet, entirely run off, and it created a little\ntorrent in the centre of the bottom, and he was forced to hug the wall\nin order not to have his feet in the water.\n\nThus he proceeded in the gloom. He resembled the beings of the night\ngroping in the invisible and lost beneath the earth in veins of shadow.\n\nStill, little by little, whether it was that the distant air-holes\nemitted a little wavering light in this opaque gloom, or whether his\neyes had become accustomed to the obscurity, some vague vision returned\nto him, and he began once more to gain a confused idea, now of the wall\nwhich he touched, now of the vault beneath which he was passing. The\npupil dilates in the dark, and the soul dilates in misfortune and ends\nby finding God there.\n\nIt was not easy to direct his course.\n\nThe line of the sewer re-echoes, so to speak, the line of the streets\nwhich lie above it. There were then in Paris two thousand two hundred\nstreets. Let the reader imagine himself beneath that forest of gloomy\nbranches which is called the sewer. The system of sewers existing at\nthat epoch, placed end to end, would have given a length of eleven\nleagues. We have said above, that the actual net-work, thanks to the\nspecial activity of the last thirty years, was no less than sixty\nleagues in extent.\n\nJean Valjean began by committing a blunder. He thought that he was\nbeneath the Rue Saint-Denis, and it was a pity that it was not so. Under\nthe Rue Saint-Denis there is an old stone sewer which dates from Louis\nXIII. and which runs straight to the collecting sewer, called the Grand\nSewer, with but a single elbow, on the right, on the elevation of the\nancient Cour des Miracles, and a single branch, the Saint-Martin sewer,\nwhose four arms describe a cross. But the gut of the Petite-Truanderie\nthe entrance to which was in the vicinity of the Corinthe wine-shop has\nnever communicated with the sewer of the Rue Saint-Denis; it ended\nat the Montmartre sewer, and it was in this that Jean Valjean was\nentangled. There opportunities of losing oneself abound. The Montmartre\nsewer is one of the most labyrinthine of the ancient network.\nFortunately, Jean Valjean had left behind him the sewer of the markets\nwhose geometrical plan presents the appearance of a multitude of\nparrots' roosts piled on top of each other; but he had before him more\nthan one embarrassing encounter and more than one street corner--for\nthey are streets--presenting itself in the gloom like an interrogation\npoint; first, on his left, the vast sewer of the Platriere, a sort of\nChinese puzzle, thrusting out and entangling its chaos of Ts and Zs\nunder the Post-Office and under the rotunda of the Wheat Market, as far\nas the Seine, where it terminates in a Y; secondly, on his right, the\ncurving corridor of the Rue du Cadran with its three teeth, which\nare also blind courts; thirdly, on his left, the branch of the\nMail, complicated, almost at its inception, with a sort of fork, and\nproceeding from zig-zag to zig-zag until it ends in the grand crypt of\nthe outlet of the Louvre, truncated and ramified in every direction; and\nlastly, the blind alley of a passage of the Rue des Jeuneurs, without\ncounting little ducts here and there, before reaching the belt sewer,\nwhich alone could conduct him to some issue sufficiently distant to be\nsafe.\n\nHad Jean Valjean had any idea of all that we have here pointed out, he\nwould speedily have perceived, merely by feeling the wall, that he was\nnot in the subterranean gallery of the Rue Saint-Denis. Instead of the\nancient stone, instead of the antique architecture, haughty and royal\neven in the sewer, with pavement and string courses of granite and\nmortar costing eight hundred livres the fathom, he would have felt under\nhis hand contemporary cheapness, economical expedients, porous stone\nfilled with mortar on a concrete foundation, which costs two hundred\nfrancs the metre, and the bourgeoise masonry known as a petits\nmateriaux--small stuff; but of all this he knew nothing.\n\nHe advanced with anxiety, but with calmness, seeing nothing, knowing\nnothing, buried in chance, that is to say, engulfed in providence.\n\nBy degrees, we will admit, a certain horror seized upon him. The gloom\nwhich enveloped him penetrated his spirit. He walked in an enigma. This\naqueduct of the sewer is formidable; it interlaces in a dizzy fashion.\nIt is a melancholy thing to be caught in this Paris of shadows. Jean\nValjean was obliged to find and even to invent his route without seeing\nit. In this unknown, every step that he risked might be his last. How\nwas he to get out? should he find an issue? should he find it in time?\nwould that colossal subterranean sponge with its stone cavities, allow\nitself to be penetrated and pierced? should he there encounter some\nunexpected knot in the darkness? should he arrive at the inextricable\nand the impassable? would Marius die there of hemorrhage and he of\nhunger? should they end by both getting lost, and by furnishing two\nskeletons in a nook of that night? He did not know. He put all these\nquestions to himself without replying to them. The intestines of Paris\nform a precipice. Like the prophet, he was in the belly of the monster.\n\nAll at once, he had a surprise. At the most unforeseen moment, and\nwithout having ceased to walk in a straight line, he perceived that he\nwas no longer ascending; the water of the rivulet was beating against\nhis heels, instead of meeting him at his toes. The sewer was now\ndescending. Why? Was he about to arrive suddenly at the Seine? This\ndanger was a great one, but the peril of retreating was still greater.\nHe continued to advance.\n\nIt was not towards the Seine that he was proceeding. The ridge which\nthe soil of Paris forms on its right bank empties one of its water-sheds\ninto the Seine and the other into the Grand Sewer. The crest of this\nridge which determines the division of the waters describes a very\ncapricious line. The culminating point, which is the point of\nseparation of the currents, is in the Sainte-Avoye sewer, beyond the Rue\nMichelle-Comte, in the sewer of the Louvre, near the boulevards, and\nin the Montmartre sewer, near the Halles. It was this culminating point\nthat Jean Valjean had reached. He was directing his course towards the\nbelt sewer; he was on the right path. But he did not know it.\n\nEvery time that he encountered a branch, he felt of its angles, and if\nhe found that the opening which presented itself was smaller than the\npassage in which he was, he did not enter but continued his route,\nrightly judging that every narrower way must needs terminate in a blind\nalley, and could only lead him further from his goal, that is to say,\nthe outlet. Thus he avoided the quadruple trap which was set for him in\nthe darkness by the four labyrinths which we have just enumerated.\n\nAt a certain moment, he perceived that he was emerging from beneath\nthe Paris which was petrified by the uprising, where the barricades had\nsuppressed circulation, and that he was entering beneath the living and\nnormal Paris. Overhead he suddenly heard a noise as of thunder, distant\nbut continuous. It was the rumbling of vehicles.\n\nHe had been walking for about half an hour, at least according to the\ncalculation which he made in his own mind, and he had not yet thought of\nrest; he had merely changed the hand with which he was holding Marius.\nThe darkness was more profound than ever, but its very depth reassured\nhim.\n\nAll at once, he saw his shadow in front of him. It was outlined on\na faint, almost indistinct reddish glow, which vaguely empurpled the\nflooring vault underfoot, and the vault overhead, and gilded to his\nright and to his left the two viscous walls of the passage. Stupefied,\nhe turned round.\n\nBehind him, in the portion of the passage which he had just passed\nthrough, at a distance which appeared to him immense, piercing the dense\nobscurity, flamed a sort of horrible star which had the air of surveying\nhim.\n\nIt was the gloomy star of the police which was rising in the sewer.\n\nIn the rear of that star eight or ten forms were moving about in a\nconfused way, black, upright, indistinct, horrible.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II--EXPLANATION\n\nOn the day of the sixth of June, a battue of the sewers had been\nordered. It was feared that the vanquished might have taken to them for\nrefuge, and Prefect Gisquet was to search occult Paris while General\nBugeaud swept public Paris; a double and connected operation which\nexacted a double strategy on the part of the public force, represented\nabove by the army and below by the police. Three squads of agents and\nsewermen explored the subterranean drain of Paris, the first on the\nright bank, the second on the left bank, the third in the city. The\nagents of police were armed with carabines, with bludgeons, swords and\npoignards.\n\nThat which was directed at Jean Valjean at that moment, was the lantern\nof the patrol of the right bank.\n\nThis patrol had just visited the curving gallery and the three blind\nalleys which lie beneath the Rue du Cadran. While they were passing\ntheir lantern through the depths of these blind alleys, Jean Valjean had\nencountered on his path the entrance to the gallery, had perceived\nthat it was narrower than the principal passage and had not penetrated\nthither. He had passed on. The police, on emerging from the gallery\ndu Cadran, had fancied that they heard the sound of footsteps in the\ndirection of the belt sewer. They were, in fact, the steps of Jean\nValjean. The sergeant in command of the patrol had raised his lantern,\nand the squad had begun to gaze into the mist in the direction whence\nthe sound proceeded.\n\nThis was an indescribable moment for Jean Valjean.\n\nHappily, if he saw the lantern well, the lantern saw him but ill. It\nwas light and he was shadow. He was very far off, and mingled with the\ndarkness of the place. He hugged the wall and halted. Moreover, he did\nnot understand what it was that was moving behind him. The lack of sleep\nand food, and his emotions had caused him also to pass into the state of\na visionary. He beheld a gleam, and around that gleam, forms. What was\nit? He did not comprehend.\n\nJean Valjean having paused, the sound ceased.\n\nThe men of the patrol listened, and heard nothing, they looked and saw\nnothing. They held a consultation.\n\nThere existed at that epoch at this point of the Montmartre sewer a sort\nof cross-roads called de service, which was afterwards suppressed, on\naccount of the little interior lake which formed there, swallowing up\nthe torrent of rain in heavy storms. The patrol could form a cluster in\nthis open space. Jean Valjean saw these spectres form a sort of circle.\nThese bull-dogs' heads approached each other closely and whispered\ntogether.\n\nThe result of this council held by the watch dogs was, that they had\nbeen mistaken, that there had been no noise, that it was useless to get\nentangled in the belt sewer, that it would only be a waste of time,\nbut that they ought to hasten towards Saint-Merry; that if there\nwas anything to do, and any \"bousingot\" to track out, it was in that\nquarter.\n\nFrom time to time, parties re-sole their old insults. In 1832, the word\nbousingot formed the interim between the word jacobin, which had become\nobsolete, and the word demagogue which has since rendered such excellent\nservice.\n\nThe sergeant gave orders to turn to the left, towards the watershed of\nthe Seine.\n\nIf it had occurred to them to separate into two squads, and to go in\nboth directions, Jean Valjean would have been captured. All hung on\nthat thread. It is probable that the instructions of the prefecture,\nforeseeing a possibility of combat and insurgents in force, had\nforbidden the patrol to part company. The patrol resumed its march,\nleaving Jean Valjean behind it. Of all this movement, Jean Valjean\nperceived nothing, except the eclipse of the lantern which suddenly\nwheeled round.\n\nBefore taking his departure, the Sergeant, in order to acquit his\npoliceman's conscience, discharged his gun in the direction of Jean\nValjean. The detonation rolled from echo to echo in the crypt, like the\nrumbling of that titanic entrail. A bit of plaster which fell into the\nstream and splashed up the water a few paces away from Jean Valjean,\nwarned him that the ball had struck the arch over his head.\n\nSlow and measured steps resounded for some time on the timber work,\ngradually dying away as they retreated to a greater distance; the group\nof black forms vanished, a glimmer of light oscillated and floated,\ncommunicating to the vault a reddish glow which grew fainter, then\ndisappeared; the silence became profound once more, the obscurity became\ncomplete, blindness and deafness resumed possession of the shadows;\nand Jean Valjean, not daring to stir as yet, remained for a long time\nleaning with his back against the wall, with straining ears, and dilated\npupils, watching the disappearance of that phantom patrol.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III--THE \"SPUN\" MAN\n\nThis justice must be rendered to the police of that period, that even in\nthe most serious public junctures, it imperturbably fulfilled its duties\nconnected with the sewers and surveillance. A revolt was, in its eyes,\nno pretext for allowing malefactors to take the bit in their own mouths,\nand for neglecting society for the reason that the government was in\nperil. The ordinary service was performed correctly in company with the\nextraordinary service, and was not troubled by the latter. In the midst\nof an incalculable political event already begun, under the pressure of\na possible revolution, a police agent, \"spun\" a thief without allowing\nhimself to be distracted by insurrection and barricades.\n\nIt was something precisely parallel which took place on the afternoon\nof the 6th of June on the banks of the Seine, on the slope of the right\nshore, a little beyond the Pont des Invalides.\n\nThere is no longer any bank there now. The aspect of the locality has\nchanged.\n\nOn that bank, two men, separated by a certain distance, seemed to be\nwatching each other while mutually avoiding each other. The one who was\nin advance was trying to get away, the one in the rear was trying to\novertake the other.\n\nIt was like a game of checkers played at a distance and in silence.\nNeither seemed to be in any hurry, and both walked slowly, as though\neach of them feared by too much haste to make his partner redouble his\npace.\n\nOne would have said that it was an appetite following its prey, and\npurposely without wearing the air of doing so. The prey was crafty and\non its guard.\n\nThe proper relations between the hunted pole-cat and the hunting dog\nwere observed. The one who was seeking to escape had an insignificant\nmien and not an impressive appearance; the one who was seeking to seize\nhim was rude of aspect, and must have been rude to encounter.\n\nThe first, conscious that he was the more feeble, avoided the second;\nbut he avoided him in a manner which was deeply furious; any one who\ncould have observed him would have discerned in his eyes the sombre\nhostility of flight, and all the menace that fear contains.\n\nThe shore was deserted; there were no passers-by; not even a boatman nor\na lighter-man was in the skiffs which were moored here and there.\n\nIt was not easy to see these two men, except from the quay opposite, and\nto any person who had scrutinized them at that distance, the man who was\nin advance would have appeared like a bristling, tattered, and equivocal\nbeing, who was uneasy and trembling beneath a ragged blouse, and the\nother like a classic and official personage, wearing the frock-coat of\nauthority buttoned to the chin.\n\nPerchance the reader might recognize these two men, if he were to see\nthem closer at hand.\n\nWhat was the object of the second man?\n\nProbably to succeed in clothing the first more warmly.\n\nWhen a man clothed by the state pursues a man in rags, it is in order\nto make of him a man who is also clothed by the state. Only, the whole\nquestion lies in the color. To be dressed in blue is glorious; to be\ndressed in red is disagreeable.\n\nThere is a purple from below.\n\nIt is probably some unpleasantness and some purple of this sort which\nthe first man is desirous of shirking.\n\nIf the other allowed him to walk on, and had not seized him as yet, it\nwas, judging from all appearances, in the hope of seeing him lead up to\nsome significant meeting-place and to some group worth catching. This\ndelicate operation is called \"spinning.\"\n\nWhat renders this conjecture entirely probable is that the buttoned-up\nman, on catching sight from the shore of a hackney-coach on the quay\nas it was passing along empty, made a sign to the driver; the driver\nunderstood, evidently recognized the person with whom he had to deal,\nturned about and began to follow the two men at the top of the quay,\nat a foot-pace. This was not observed by the slouching and tattered\npersonage who was in advance.\n\nThe hackney-coach rolled along the trees of the Champs-Elysees. The\nbust of the driver, whip in hand, could be seen moving along above the\nparapet.\n\nOne of the secret instructions of the police authorities to their agents\ncontains this article: \"Always have on hand a hackney-coach, in case of\nemergency.\"\n\nWhile these two men were manoeuvring, each on his own side, with\nirreproachable strategy, they approached an inclined plane on the quay\nwhich descended to the shore, and which permitted cab-drivers arriving\nfrom Passy to come to the river and water their horses. This inclined\nplane was suppressed later on, for the sake of symmetry; horses may die\nof thirst, but the eye is gratified.\n\nIt is probable that the man in the blouse had intended to ascend\nthis inclined plane, with a view to making his escape into the\nChamps-Elysees, a place ornamented with trees, but, in return, much\ninfested with policemen, and where the other could easily exercise\nviolence.\n\nThis point on the quay is not very far distant from the house brought to\nParis from Moret in 1824, by Colonel Brack, and designated as \"the house\nof Francois I.\" A guard house is situated close at hand.\n\nTo the great surprise of his watcher, the man who was being tracked did\nnot mount by the inclined plane for watering. He continued to advance\nalong the quay on the shore.\n\nHis position was visibly becoming critical.\n\nWhat was he intending to do, if not to throw himself into the Seine?\n\nHenceforth, there existed no means of ascending to the quay; there was\nno other inclined plane, no staircase; and they were near the spot,\nmarked by the bend in the Seine towards the Pont de Jena, where the\nbank, growing constantly narrower, ended in a slender tongue, and\nwas lost in the water. There he would inevitably find himself blocked\nbetween the perpendicular wall on his right, the river on his left and\nin front of him, and the authorities on his heels.\n\nIt is true that this termination of the shore was hidden from sight by a\nheap of rubbish six or seven feet in height, produced by some demolition\nor other. But did this man hope to conceal himself effectually behind\nthat heap of rubbish, which one need but skirt? The expedient would\nhave been puerile. He certainly was not dreaming of such a thing. The\ninnocence of thieves does not extend to that point.\n\nThe pile of rubbish formed a sort of projection at the water's edge,\nwhich was prolonged in a promontory as far as the wall of the quay.\n\nThe man who was being followed arrived at this little mound and went\nround it, so that he ceased to be seen by the other.\n\nThe latter, as he did not see, could not be seen; he took advantage of\nthis fact to abandon all dissimulation and to walk very rapidly. In a\nfew moments, he had reached the rubbish heap and passed round it. There\nhe halted in sheer amazement. The man whom he had been pursuing was no\nlonger there.\n\nTotal eclipse of the man in the blouse.\n\nThe shore, beginning with the rubbish heap, was only about thirty paces\nlong, then it plunged into the water which beat against the wall of the\nquay. The fugitive could not have thrown himself into the Seine without\nbeing seen by the man who was following him. What had become of him?\n\nThe man in the buttoned-up coat walked to the extremity of the shore,\nand remained there in thought for a moment, his fists clenched, his eyes\nsearching. All at once he smote his brow. He had just perceived, at the\npoint where the land came to an end and the water began, a large iron\ngrating, low, arched, garnished with a heavy lock and with three massive\nhinges. This grating, a sort of door pierced at the base of the quay,\nopened on the river as well as on the shore. A blackish stream passed\nunder it. This stream discharged into the Seine.\n\nBeyond the heavy, rusty iron bars, a sort of dark and vaulted corridor\ncould be descried. The man folded his arms and stared at the grating\nwith an air of reproach.\n\nAs this gaze did not suffice, he tried to thrust it aside; he shook\nit, it resisted solidly. It is probable that it had just been opened,\nalthough no sound had been heard, a singular circumstance in so rusty a\ngrating; but it is certain that it had been closed again. This indicated\nthat the man before whom that door had just opened had not a hook but a\nkey.\n\nThis evidence suddenly burst upon the mind of the man who was trying to\nmove the grating, and evoked from him this indignant ejaculation:\n\n\"That is too much! A government key!\"\n\nThen, immediately regaining his composure, he expressed a whole world\nof interior ideas by this outburst of monosyllables accented almost\nironically: \"Come! Come! Come! Come!\"\n\nThat said, and in the hope of something or other, either that he should\nsee the man emerge or other men enter, he posted himself on the watch\nbehind a heap of rubbish, with the patient rage of a pointer.\n\nThe hackney-coach, which regulated all its movements on his, had, in its\nturn, halted on the quay above him, close to the parapet. The coachman,\nforeseeing a prolonged wait, encased his horses' muzzles in the bag of\noats which is damp at the bottom, and which is so familiar to Parisians,\nto whom, be it said in parenthesis, the Government sometimes applies it.\nThe rare passers-by on the Pont de Jena turned their heads, before they\npursued their way, to take a momentary glance at these two motionless\nitems in the landscape, the man on the shore, the carriage on the quay.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV--HE ALSO BEARS HIS CROSS\n\nJean Valjean had resumed his march and had not again paused.\n\nThis march became more and more laborious. The level of these vaults\nvaries; the average height is about five feet, six inches, and has been\ncalculated for the stature of a man; Jean Valjean was forced to bend\nover, in order not to strike Marius against the vault; at every step\nhe had to bend, then to rise, and to feel incessantly of the wall. The\nmoisture of the stones, and the viscous nature of the timber framework\nfurnished but poor supports to which to cling, either for hand or foot.\nHe stumbled along in the hideous dung-heap of the city. The intermittent\ngleams from the air-holes only appeared at very long intervals, and were\nso wan that the full sunlight seemed like the light of the moon; all\nthe rest was mist, miasma, opaqueness, blackness. Jean Valjean was both\nhungry and thirsty; especially thirsty; and this, like the sea, was a\nplace full of water where a man cannot drink. His strength, which was\nprodigious, as the reader knows, and which had been but little decreased\nby age, thanks to his chaste and sober life, began to give way,\nnevertheless. Fatigue began to gain on him; and as his strength\ndecreased, it made the weight of his burden increase. Marius, who was,\nperhaps, dead, weighed him down as inert bodies weigh. Jean Valjean\nheld him in such a manner that his chest was not oppressed, and so that\nrespiration could proceed as well as possible. Between his legs he felt\nthe rapid gliding of the rats. One of them was frightened to such a\ndegree that he bit him. From time to time, a breath of fresh air reached\nhim through the vent-holes of the mouths of the sewer, and re-animated\nhim.\n\nIt might have been three hours past midday when he reached the\nbelt-sewer.\n\nHe was, at first, astonished at this sudden widening. He found himself,\nall at once, in a gallery where his outstretched hands could not reach\nthe two walls, and beneath a vault which his head did not touch. The\nGrand Sewer is, in fact, eight feet wide and seven feet high.\n\nAt the point where the Montmartre sewer joins the Grand Sewer, two other\nsubterranean galleries, that of the Rue de Provence, and that of the\nAbattoir, form a square. Between these four ways, a less sagacious man\nwould have remained undecided. Jean Valjean selected the broadest, that\nis to say, the belt-sewer. But here the question again came up--should\nhe descend or ascend? He thought that the situation required haste, and\nthat he must now gain the Seine at any risk. In other terms, he must\ndescend. He turned to the left.\n\nIt was well that he did so, for it is an error to suppose that the\nbelt-sewer has two outlets, the one in the direction of Bercy, the other\ntowards Passy, and that it is, as its name indicates, the subterranean\ngirdle of the Paris on the right bank. The Grand Sewer, which is, it\nmust be remembered, nothing else than the old brook of Menilmontant,\nterminates, if one ascends it, in a blind sack, that is to say, at its\nancient point of departure which was its source, at the foot of the\nknoll of Menilmontant. There is no direct communication with the\nbranch which collects the waters of Paris beginning with the Quartier\nPopincourt, and which falls into the Seine through the Amelot sewer\nabove the ancient Isle Louviers. This branch, which completes the\ncollecting sewer, is separated from it, under the Rue Menilmontant\nitself, by a pile which marks the dividing point of the waters, between\nupstream and downstream. If Jean Valjean had ascended the gallery he\nwould have arrived, after a thousand efforts, and broken down with\nfatigue, and in an expiring condition, in the gloom, at a wall. He would\nhave been lost.\n\nIn case of necessity, by retracing his steps a little way, and entering\nthe passage of the Filles-du-Calvaire, on condition that he did not\nhesitate at the subterranean crossing of the Carrefour Boucherat, and by\ntaking the corridor Saint-Louis, then the Saint-Gilles gut on the left,\nthen turning to the right and avoiding the Saint-Sebastian gallery, he\nmight have reached the Amelot sewer, and thence, provided that he did\nnot go astray in the sort of F which lies under the Bastille, he might\nhave attained the outlet on the Seine near the Arsenal. But in order\nto do this, he must have been thoroughly familiar with the enormous\nmadrepore of the sewer in all its ramifications and in all its openings.\nNow, we must again insist that he knew nothing of that frightful drain\nwhich he was traversing; and had any one asked him in what he was, he\nwould have answered: \"In the night.\"\n\nHis instinct served him well. To descend was, in fact, possible safety.\n\nHe left on his right the two narrow passages which branch out in the\nform of a claw under the Rue Laffitte and the Rue Saint-Georges and the\nlong, bifurcated corridor of the Chaussee d'Antin.\n\nA little beyond an affluent, which was, probably, the Madeleine branch,\nhe halted. He was extremely weary. A passably large air-hole, probably\nthe man-hole in the Rue d'Anjou, furnished a light that was almost\nvivid. Jean Valjean, with the gentleness of movement which a brother\nwould exercise towards his wounded brother, deposited Marius on the\nbanquette of the sewer. Marius' blood-stained face appeared under the\nwan light of the air-hole like the ashes at the bottom of a tomb. His\neyes were closed, his hair was plastered down on his temples like a\npainter's brushes dried in red wash; his hands hung limp and dead. A\nclot of blood had collected in the knot of his cravat; his limbs were\ncold, and blood was clotted at the corners of his mouth; his shirt had\nthrust itself into his wounds, the cloth of his coat was chafing the\nyawning gashes in the living flesh. Jean Valjean, pushing aside the\ngarments with the tips of his fingers, laid his hand upon Marius'\nbreast; his heart was still beating. Jean Valjean tore up his shirt,\nbandaged the young man's wounds as well as he was able and stopped the\nflowing blood; then bending over Marius, who still lay unconscious\nand almost without breathing, in that half light, he gazed at him with\ninexpressible hatred.\n\nOn disarranging Marius' garments, he had found two things in his\npockets, the roll which had been forgotten there on the preceding\nevening, and Marius' pocketbook. He ate the roll and opened the\npocketbook. On the first page he found the four lines written by Marius.\nThe reader will recall them:\n\n\"My name is Marius Pontmercy. Carry my body to my grandfather, M.\nGillenormand, Rue des Filles-du-Calvaire, No. 6, in the Marais.\"\n\nJean Valjean read these four lines by the light of the air-hole, and\nremained for a moment as though absorbed in thought, repeating in a low\ntone: \"Rue des Filles-du-Calvaire, number 6, Monsieur Gillenormand.\" He\nreplaced the pocketbook in Marius' pocket. He had eaten, his strength\nhad returned to him; he took Marius up once more upon his back, placed\nthe latter's head carefully on his right shoulder, and resumed his\ndescent of the sewer.\n\nThe Grand Sewer, directed according to the course of the valley of\nMenilmontant, is about two leagues long. It is paved throughout a\nnotable portion of its extent.\n\nThis torch of the names of the streets of Paris, with which we are\nilluminating for the reader Jean Valjean's subterranean march, Jean\nValjean himself did not possess. Nothing told him what zone of the city\nhe was traversing, nor what way he had made. Only the growing pallor of\nthe pools of light which he encountered from time to time indicated to\nhim that the sun was withdrawing from the pavement, and that the day\nwould soon be over; and the rolling of vehicles overhead, having become\nintermittent instead of continuous, then having almost ceased, he\nconcluded that he was no longer under central Paris, and that he\nwas approaching some solitary region, in the vicinity of the outer\nboulevards, or the extreme outer quays. Where there are fewer houses and\nstreets, the sewer has fewer air-holes. The gloom deepened around Jean\nValjean. Nevertheless, he continued to advance, groping his way in the\ndark.\n\nSuddenly this darkness became terrible.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V--IN THE CASE OF SAND AS IN THAT OF WOMAN, THERE IS A FINENESS\nWHICH IS TREACHEROUS\n\nHe felt that he was entering the water, and that he no longer had a\npavement under his feet, but only mud.\n\nIt sometimes happens, that on certain shores of Bretagne or Scotland a\nman, either a traveller or a fisherman, while walking at low tide on the\nbeach far from shore, suddenly notices that for several minutes past,\nhe has been walking with some difficulty. The beach under foot is\nlike pitch; his soles stick fast to it; it is no longer sand, it is\nbird-lime. The strand is perfectly dry, but at every step that he takes,\nas soon as the foot is raised, the print is filled with water. The\neye, however, has perceived no change; the immense beach is smooth and\ntranquil, all the sand has the same aspect, nothing distinguishes the\nsoil that is solid from that which is not solid; the joyous little\ncloud of sand-lice continues to leap tumultuously under the feet of the\npasser-by.\n\nThe man pursues his way, he walks on, turns towards the land, endeavors\nto approach the shore. He is not uneasy. Uneasy about what? Only he is\nconscious that the heaviness of his feet seems to be increasing at every\nstep that he takes. All at once he sinks in. He sinks in two or three\ninches. Decidedly, he is not on the right road; he halts to get his\nbearings. Suddenly he glances at his feet; his feet have disappeared.\nThe sand has covered them. He draws his feet out of the sand, he tries\nto retrace his steps, he turns back, he sinks in more deeply than\nbefore. The sand is up to his ankles, he tears himself free from it\nand flings himself to the left, the sand reaches to mid-leg, he flings\nhimself to the right, the sand comes up to his knees. Then, with\nindescribable terror, he recognizes the fact that he is caught in a\nquicksand, and that he has beneath him that frightful medium in which\nneither man can walk nor fish can swim. He flings away his burden, if he\nhave one, he lightens himself, like a ship in distress; it is too late,\nthe sand is above his knees.\n\nHe shouts, he waves his hat, or his handkerchief, the sand continually\ngains on him; if the beach is deserted, if the land is too far away, if\nthe bank of sand is too ill-famed, there is no hero in the neighborhood,\nall is over, he is condemned to be engulfed. He is condemned to that\nterrible interment, long, infallible, implacable, which it is impossible\nto either retard or hasten, which lasts for hours, which will not come\nto an end, which seizes you erect, free, in the flush of health, which\ndrags you down by the feet, which, at every effort that you attempt, at\nevery shout that you utter, draws you a little lower, which has the air\nof punishing you for your resistance by a redoubled grasp, which forces\na man to return slowly to earth, while leaving him time to survey the\nhorizon, the trees, the verdant country, the smoke of the villages on\nthe plain, the sails of the ships on the sea, the birds which fly\nand sing, the sun and the sky. This engulfment is the sepulchre which\nassumes a tide, and which mounts from the depths of the earth towards\na living man. Each minute is an inexorable layer-out of the dead. The\nwretched man tries to sit down, to lie down, to climb; every movement\nthat he makes buries him deeper; he straightens himself up, he sinks; he\nfeels that he is being swallowed up; he shrieks, implores, cries to the\nclouds, wrings his hands, grows desperate. Behold him in the sand up\nto his belly, the sand reaches to his breast, he is only a bust now.\nHe uplifts his hands, utters furious groans, clenches his nails on the\nbeach, tries to cling fast to that ashes, supports himself on his elbows\nin order to raise himself from that soft sheath, and sobs frantically;\nthe sand mounts higher. The sand has reached his shoulders, the sand\nreaches to his throat; only his face is visible now. His mouth cries\naloud, the sand fills it; silence. His eyes still gaze forth, the sand\ncloses them, night. Then his brow decreases, a little hair quivers above\nthe sand; a hand projects, pierces the surface of the beach, waves and\ndisappears. Sinister obliteration of a man.\n\nSometimes a rider is engulfed with his horse; sometimes the carter is\nswallowed up with his cart; all founders in that strand. It is shipwreck\nelsewhere than in the water. It is the earth drowning a man. The earth,\npermeated with the ocean, becomes a pitfall. It presents itself in the\nguise of a plain, and it yawns like a wave. The abyss is subject to\nthese treacheries.\n\nThis melancholy fate, always possible on certain sea beaches, was also\npossible, thirty years ago, in the sewers of Paris.\n\nBefore the important works, undertaken in 1833, the subterranean drain\nof Paris was subject to these sudden slides.\n\nThe water filtered into certain subjacent strata, which were\nparticularly friable; the foot-way, which was of flag-stones, as in\nthe ancient sewers, or of cement on concrete, as in the new galleries,\nhaving no longer an underpinning, gave way. A fold in a flooring of this\nsort means a crack, means crumbling. The framework crumbled away for a\ncertain length. This crevice, the hiatus of a gulf of mire, was called a\nfontis, in the special tongue. What is a fontis? It is the quicksands of\nthe seashore suddenly encountered under the surface of the earth; it is\nthe beach of Mont Saint-Michel in a sewer. The soaked soil is in a\nstate of fusion, as it were; all its molecules are in suspension in soft\nmedium; it is not earth and it is not water. The depth is sometimes very\ngreat. Nothing can be more formidable than such an encounter. If the\nwater predominates, death is prompt, the man is swallowed up; if earth\npredominates, death is slow.\n\nCan any one picture to himself such a death? If being swallowed by the\nearth is terrible on the seashore, what is it in a cess-pool? Instead of\nthe open air, the broad daylight, the clear horizon, those vast sounds,\nthose free clouds whence rains life, instead of those barks descried\nin the distance, of that hope under all sorts of forms, of probable\npassers-by, of succor possible up to the very last moment,--instead\nof all this, deafness, blindness, a black vault, the inside of a tomb\nalready prepared, death in the mire beneath a cover! slow suffocation\nby filth, a stone box where asphyxia opens its claw in the mire and\nclutches you by the throat; fetidness mingled with the death-rattle;\nslime instead of the strand, sulfuretted hydrogen in place of the\nhurricane, dung in place of the ocean! And to shout, to gnash one's\nteeth, and to writhe, and to struggle, and to agonize, with that\nenormous city which knows nothing of it all, over one's head!\n\nInexpressible is the horror of dying thus! Death sometimes redeems\nhis atrocity by a certain terrible dignity. On the funeral pile, in\nshipwreck, one can be great; in the flames as in the foam, a superb\nattitude is possible; one there becomes transfigured as one perishes.\nBut not here. Death is filthy. It is humiliating to expire. The supreme\nfloating visions are abject. Mud is synonymous with shame. It is\npetty, ugly, infamous. To die in a butt of Malvoisie, like Clarence, is\npermissible; in the ditch of a scavenger, like Escoubleau, is horrible.\nTo struggle therein is hideous; at the same time that one is going\nthrough the death agony, one is floundering about. There are shadows\nenough for hell, and mire enough to render it nothing but a slough, and\nthe dying man knows not whether he is on the point of becoming a spectre\nor a frog.\n\nEverywhere else the sepulchre is sinister; here it is deformed.\n\nThe depth of the fontis varied, as well as their length and their\ndensity, according to the more or less bad quality of the sub-soil.\nSometimes a fontis was three or four feet deep, sometimes eight or ten;\nsometimes the bottom was unfathomable. Here the mire was almost solid,\nthere almost liquid. In the Luniere fontis, it would have taken a man a\nday to disappear, while he would have been devoured in five minutes by\nthe Philippeaux slough. The mire bears up more or less, according to its\ndensity. A child can escape where a man will perish. The first law of\nsafety is to get rid of every sort of load. Every sewerman who felt the\nground giving way beneath him began by flinging away his sack of tools,\nor his back-basket, or his hod.\n\nThe fontis were due to different causes: the friability of the soil;\nsome landslip at a depth beyond the reach of man; the violent summer\nrains; the incessant flooding of winter; long, drizzling showers.\nSometimes the weight of the surrounding houses on a marly or sandy soil\nforced out the vaults of the subterranean galleries and caused them to\nbend aside, or it chanced that a flooring vault burst and split under\nthis crushing thrust. In this manner, the heaping up of the Parthenon,\nobliterated, a century ago, a portion of the vaults of Saint-Genevieve\nhill. When a sewer was broken in under the pressure of the houses, the\nmischief was sometimes betrayed in the street above by a sort of space,\nlike the teeth of a saw, between the paving-stones; this crevice was\ndeveloped in an undulating line throughout the entire length of the\ncracked vault, and then, the evil being visible, the remedy could be\npromptly applied. It also frequently happened, that the interior ravages\nwere not revealed by any external scar, and in that case, woe to the\nsewermen. When they entered without precaution into the sewer, they were\nliable to be lost. Ancient registers make mention of several scavengers\nwho were buried in fontis in this manner. They give many names; among\nothers, that of the sewerman who was swallowed up in a quagmire under\nthe man-hole of the Rue Careme-Prenant, a certain Blaise Poutrain; this\nBlaise Poutrain was the brother of Nicholas Poutrain, who was the last\ngrave-digger of the cemetery called the Charnier des Innocents, in 1785,\nthe epoch when that cemetery expired.\n\nThere was also that young and charming Vicomte d'Escoubleau, of whom we\nhave just spoken, one of the heroes of the siege of Lerida, where they\ndelivered the assault in silk stockings, with violins at their head.\nD'Escoubleau, surprised one night at his cousin's, the Duchess de\nSourdis', was drowned in a quagmire of the Beautreillis sewer, in which\nhe had taken refuge in order to escape from the Duke. Madame de Sourdis,\nwhen informed of his death, demanded her smelling-bottle, and forgot to\nweep, through sniffling at her salts. In such cases, there is no love\nwhich holds fast; the sewer extinguishes it. Hero refuses to wash the\nbody of Leander. Thisbe stops her nose in the presence of Pyramus and\nsays: \"Phew!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI--THE FONTIS\n\nJean Valjean found himself in the presence of a fontis.\n\nThis sort of quagmire was common at that period in the subsoil of the\nChamps-Elysees, difficult to handle in the hydraulic works and a bad\npreservative of the subterranean constructions, on account of its\nexcessive fluidity. This fluidity exceeds even the inconsistency of the\nsands of the Quartier Saint-Georges, which could only be conquered by\na stone construction on a concrete foundation, and the clayey strata,\ninfected with gas, of the Quartier des Martyrs, which are so liquid\nthat the only way in which a passage was effected under the gallery des\nMartyrs was by means of a cast-iron pipe. When, in 1836, the old stone\nsewer beneath the Faubourg Saint-Honore, in which we now see Jean\nValjean, was demolished for the purpose of reconstructing it, the\nquicksand, which forms the subsoil of the Champs-Elysees as far as the\nSeine, presented such an obstacle, that the operation lasted nearly\nsix months, to the great clamor of the dwellers on the riverside,\nparticularly those who had hotels and carriages. The work was more than\nunhealthy; it was dangerous. It is true that they had four months and a\nhalf of rain, and three floods of the Seine.\n\nThe fontis which Jean Valjean had encountered was caused by the downpour\nof the preceding day. The pavement, badly sustained by the subjacent\nsand, had given way and had produced a stoppage of the water.\nInfiltration had taken place, a slip had followed. The dislocated bottom\nhad sunk into the ooze. To what extent? Impossible to say. The obscurity\nwas more dense there than elsewhere. It was a pit of mire in a cavern of\nnight.\n\nJean Valjean felt the pavement vanishing beneath his feet. He entered\nthis slime. There was water on the surface, slime at the bottom. He must\npass it. To retrace his steps was impossible. Marius was dying, and Jean\nValjean exhausted. Besides, where was he to go? Jean Valjean advanced.\nMoreover, the pit seemed, for the first few steps, not to be very deep.\nBut in proportion as he advanced, his feet plunged deeper. Soon he had\nthe slime up to his calves and water above his knees. He walked on,\nraising Marius in his arms, as far above the water as he could. The mire\nnow reached to his knees, and the water to his waist. He could no longer\nretreat. This mud, dense enough for one man, could not, obviously,\nuphold two. Marius and Jean Valjean would have stood a chance of\nextricating themselves singly. Jean Valjean continued to advance,\nsupporting the dying man, who was, perhaps, a corpse.\n\nThe water came up to his arm-pits; he felt that he was sinking; it was\nonly with difficulty that he could move in the depth of ooze which\nhe had now reached. The density, which was his support, was also\nan obstacle. He still held Marius on high, and with an unheard-of\nexpenditure of force, he advanced still; but he was sinking. He had only\nhis head above the water now and his two arms holding up Marius. In the\nold paintings of the deluge there is a mother holding her child thus.\n\nHe sank still deeper, he turned his face to the rear, to escape the\nwater, and in order that he might be able to breathe; anyone who had\nseen him in that gloom would have thought that what he beheld was a\nmask floating on the shadows; he caught a faint glimpse above him of the\ndrooping head and livid face of Marius; he made a desperate effort and\nlaunched his foot forward; his foot struck something solid; a point of\nsupport. It was high time.\n\nHe straightened himself up, and rooted himself upon that point of\nsupport with a sort of fury. This produced upon him the effect of the\nfirst step in a staircase leading back to life.\n\nThe point of support, thus encountered in the mire at the supreme\nmoment, was the beginning of the other water-shed of the pavement, which\nhad bent but had not given way, and which had curved under the water\nlike a plank and in a single piece. Well built pavements form a vault\nand possess this sort of firmness. This fragment of the vaulting, partly\nsubmerged, but solid, was a veritable inclined plane, and, once on this\nplane, he was safe. Jean Valjean mounted this inclined plane and reached\nthe other side of the quagmire.\n\nAs he emerged from the water, he came in contact with a stone and fell\nupon his knees. He reflected that this was but just, and he remained\nthere for some time, with his soul absorbed in words addressed to God.\n\nHe rose to his feet, shivering, chilled, foul-smelling, bowed beneath\nthe dying man whom he was dragging after him, all dripping with slime,\nand his soul filled with a strange light.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII--ONE SOMETIMES RUNS AGROUND WHEN ONE FANCIES THAT ONE IS\nDISEMBARKING\n\nHe set out on his way once more.\n\nHowever, although he had not left his life in the fontis, he seemed\nto have left his strength behind him there. That supreme effort had\nexhausted him. His lassitude was now such that he was obliged to pause\nfor breath every three or four steps, and lean against the wall. Once\nhe was forced to seat himself on the banquette in order to alter Marius'\nposition, and he thought that he should have to remain there. But if his\nvigor was dead, his energy was not. He rose again.\n\nHe walked on desperately, almost fast, proceeded thus for a hundred\npaces, almost without drawing breath, and suddenly came in contact with\nthe wall. He had reached an elbow of the sewer, and, arriving at the\nturn with head bent down, he had struck the wall. He raised his eyes,\nand at the extremity of the vault, far, very far away in front of him,\nhe perceived a light. This time it was not that terrible light; it was\ngood, white light. It was daylight. Jean Valjean saw the outlet.\n\nA damned soul, who, in the midst of the furnace, should suddenly\nperceive the outlet of Gehenna, would experience what Jean Valjean felt.\nIt would fly wildly with the stumps of its burned wings towards that\nradiant portal. Jean Valjean was no longer conscious of fatigue, he no\nlonger felt Marius' weight, he found his legs once more of steel, he ran\nrather than walked. As he approached, the outlet became more and more\ndistinctly defined. It was a pointed arch, lower than the vault, which\ngradually narrowed, and narrower than the gallery, which closed in as\nthe vault grew lower. The tunnel ended like the interior of a funnel;\na faulty construction, imitated from the wickets of penitentiaries,\nlogical in a prison, illogical in a sewer, and which has since been\ncorrected.\n\nJean Valjean reached the outlet.\n\nThere he halted.\n\nIt certainly was the outlet, but he could not get out.\n\nThe arch was closed by a heavy grating, and the grating, which, to all\nappearance, rarely swung on its rusty hinges, was clamped to its stone\njamb by a thick lock, which, red with rust, seemed like an enormous\nbrick. The keyhole could be seen, and the robust latch, deeply sunk in\nthe iron staple. The door was plainly double-locked. It was one of those\nprison locks which old Paris was so fond of lavishing.\n\nBeyond the grating was the open air, the river, the daylight, the shore,\nvery narrow but sufficient for escape. The distant quays, Paris, that\ngulf in which one so easily hides oneself, the broad horizon, liberty.\nOn the right, down stream, the bridge of Jena was discernible, on the\nleft, upstream, the bridge of the Invalides; the place would have been a\npropitious one in which to await the night and to escape. It was one\nof the most solitary points in Paris; the shore which faces the\nGrand-Caillou. Flies were entering and emerging through the bars of the\ngrating.\n\nIt might have been half-past eight o'clock in the evening. The day was\ndeclining.\n\nJean Valjean laid Marius down along the wall, on the dry portion of the\nvaulting, then he went to the grating and clenched both fists round the\nbars; the shock which he gave it was frenzied, but it did not move. The\ngrating did not stir. Jean Valjean seized the bars one after the other,\nin the hope that he might be able to tear away the least solid, and to\nmake of it a lever wherewith to raise the door or to break the lock. Not\na bar stirred. The teeth of a tiger are not more firmly fixed in their\nsockets. No lever; no prying possible. The obstacle was invincible.\nThere was no means of opening the gate.\n\nMust he then stop there? What was he to do? What was to become of him?\nHe had not the strength to retrace his steps, to recommence the journey\nwhich he had already taken. Besides, how was he to again traverse that\nquagmire whence he had only extricated himself as by a miracle? And\nafter the quagmire, was there not the police patrol, which assuredly\ncould not be twice avoided? And then, whither was he to go? What\ndirection should he pursue? To follow the incline would not conduct\nhim to his goal. If he were to reach another outlet, he would find it\nobstructed by a plug or a grating. Every outlet was, undoubtedly, closed\nin that manner. Chance had unsealed the grating through which he had\nentered, but it was evident that all the other sewer mouths were barred.\nHe had only succeeded in escaping into a prison.\n\nAll was over. Everything that Jean Valjean had done was useless.\nExhaustion had ended in failure.\n\nThey were both caught in the immense and gloomy web of death, and Jean\nValjean felt the terrible spider running along those black strands and\nquivering in the shadows. He turned his back to the grating, and fell\nupon the pavement, hurled to earth rather than seated, close to Marius,\nwho still made no movement, and with his head bent between his knees.\nThis was the last drop of anguish.\n\nOf what was he thinking during this profound depression? Neither of\nhimself nor of Marius. He was thinking of Cosette.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII--THE TORN COAT-TAIL\n\nIn the midst of this prostration, a hand was laid on his shoulder, and a\nlow voice said to him:\n\n\"Half shares.\"\n\nSome person in that gloom? Nothing so closely resembles a dream as\ndespair. Jean Valjean thought that he was dreaming. He had heard no\nfootsteps. Was it possible? He raised his eyes.\n\nA man stood before him.\n\nThis man was clad in a blouse; his feet were bare; he held his shoes\nin his left hand; he had evidently removed them in order to reach Jean\nValjean, without allowing his steps to be heard.\n\nJean Valjean did not hesitate for an instant. Unexpected as was this\nencounter, this man was known to him. The man was Thenardier.\n\nAlthough awakened, so to speak, with a start, Jean Valjean, accustomed\nto alarms, and steeled to unforeseen shocks that must be promptly\nparried, instantly regained possession of his presence of mind.\nMoreover, the situation could not be made worse, a certain degree of\ndistress is no longer capable of a crescendo, and Thenardier himself\ncould add nothing to this blackness of this night.\n\nA momentary pause ensued.\n\nThenardier, raising his right hand to a level with his forehead, formed\nwith it a shade, then he brought his eyelashes together, by screwing up\nhis eyes, a motion which, in connection with a slight contraction of the\nmouth, characterizes the sagacious attention of a man who is endeavoring\nto recognize another man. He did not succeed. Jean Valjean, as we have\njust stated, had his back turned to the light, and he was, moreover,\nso disfigured, so bemired, so bleeding that he would have been\nunrecognizable in full noonday. On the contrary, illuminated by the\nlight from the grating, a cellar light, it is true, livid, yet precise\nin its lividness, Thenardier, as the energetic popular metaphor\nexpresses it, immediately \"leaped into\" Jean Valjean's eyes. This\ninequality of conditions sufficed to assure some advantage to Jean\nValjean in that mysterious duel which was on the point of beginning\nbetween the two situations and the two men. The encounter took place\nbetween Jean Valjean veiled and Thenardier unmasked.\n\nJean Valjean immediately perceived that Thenardier did not recognize\nhim.\n\nThey surveyed each other for a moment in that half-gloom, as though\ntaking each other's measure. Thenardier was the first to break the\nsilence.\n\n\"How are you going to manage to get out?\"\n\nJean Valjean made no reply. Thenardier continued:\n\n\"It's impossible to pick the lock of that gate. But still you must get\nout of this.\"\n\n\"That is true,\" said Jean Valjean.\n\n\"Well, half shares then.\"\n\n\"What do you mean by that?\"\n\n\"You have killed that man; that's all right. I have the key.\"\n\nThenardier pointed to Marius. He went on:\n\n\"I don't know you, but I want to help you. You must be a friend.\"\n\nJean Valjean began to comprehend. Thenardier took him for an assassin.\n\nThenardier resumed:\n\n\"Listen, comrade. You didn't kill that man without looking to see what\nhe had in his pockets. Give me my half. I'll open the door for you.\"\n\nAnd half drawing from beneath his tattered blouse a huge key, he added:\n\n\"Do you want to see how a key to liberty is made? Look here.\"\n\nJean Valjean \"remained stupid\"--the expression belongs to the elder\nCorneille--to such a degree that he doubted whether what he beheld was\nreal. It was providence appearing in horrible guise, and his good angel\nspringing from the earth in the form of Thenardier.\n\nThenardier thrust his fist into a large pocket concealed under his\nblouse, drew out a rope and offered it to Jean Valjean.\n\n\"Hold on,\" said he, \"I'll give you the rope to boot.\"\n\n\"What is the rope for?\"\n\n\"You will need a stone also, but you can find one outside. There's a\nheap of rubbish.\"\n\n\"What am I to do with a stone?\"\n\n\"Idiot, you'll want to sling that stiff into the river, you'll need a\nstone and a rope, otherwise it would float on the water.\"\n\nJean Valjean took the rope. There is no one who does not occasionally\naccept in this mechanical way.\n\nThenardier snapped his fingers as though an idea had suddenly occurred\nto him.\n\n\"Ah, see here, comrade, how did you contrive to get out of that slough\nyonder? I haven't dared to risk myself in it. Phew! you don't smell\ngood.\"\n\nAfter a pause he added:\n\n\"I'm asking you questions, but you're perfectly right not to answer.\nIt's an apprenticeship against that cursed quarter of an hour before the\nexamining magistrate. And then, when you don't talk at all, you run no\nrisk of talking too loud. That's no matter, as I can't see your face and\nas I don't know your name, you are wrong in supposing that I don't know\nwho you are and what you want. I twig. You've broken up that gentleman\na bit; now you want to tuck him away somewhere. The river, that great\nhider of folly, is what you want. I'll get you out of your scrape.\nHelping a good fellow in a pinch is what suits me to a hair.\"\n\nWhile expressing his approval of Jean Valjean's silence, he endeavored\nto force him to talk. He jostled his shoulder in an attempt to catch a\nsight of his profile, and he exclaimed, without, however, raising his\ntone:\n\n\"Apropos of that quagmire, you're a hearty animal. Why didn't you toss\nthe man in there?\"\n\nJean Valjean preserved silence.\n\nThenardier resumed, pushing the rag which served him as a cravat to the\nlevel of his Adam's apple, a gesture which completes the capable air of\na serious man:\n\n\"After all, you acted wisely. The workmen, when they come to-morrow to\nstop up that hole, would certainly have found the stiff abandoned there,\nand it might have been possible, thread by thread, straw by straw, to\npick up the scent and reach you. Some one has passed through the sewer.\nWho? Where did he get out? Was he seen to come out? The police are full\nof cleverness. The sewer is treacherous and tells tales of you. Such a\nfind is a rarity, it attracts attention, very few people make use of\nthe sewers for their affairs, while the river belongs to everybody. The\nriver is the true grave. At the end of a month they fish up your man\nin the nets at Saint-Cloud. Well, what does one care for that? It's\ncarrion! Who killed that man? Paris. And justice makes no inquiries. You\nhave done well.\"\n\nThe more loquacious Thenardier became, the more mute was Jean Valjean.\n\nAgain Thenardier shook him by the shoulder.\n\n\"Now let's settle this business. Let's go shares. You have seen my key,\nshow me your money.\"\n\nThenardier was haggard, fierce, suspicious, rather menacing, yet\namicable.\n\nThere was one singular circumstance; Thenardier's manners were not\nsimple; he had not the air of being wholly at his ease; while affecting\nan air of mystery, he spoke low; from time to time he laid his finger on\nhis mouth, and muttered, \"hush!\" It was difficult to divine why. There\nwas no one there except themselves. Jean Valjean thought that other\nruffians might possibly be concealed in some nook, not very far off, and\nthat Thenardier did not care to share with them.\n\nThenardier resumed:\n\n\"Let's settle up. How much did the stiff have in his bags?\"\n\nJean Valjean searched his pockets.\n\nIt was his habit, as the reader will remember, to always have some\nmoney about him. The mournful life of expedients to which he had been\ncondemned imposed this as a law upon him. On this occasion, however,\nhe had been caught unprepared. When donning his uniform of a National\nGuardsman on the preceding evening, he had forgotten, dolefully absorbed\nas he was, to take his pocket-book. He had only some small change in his\nfob. He turned out his pocket, all soaked with ooze, and spread out on\nthe banquette of the vault one louis d'or, two five-franc pieces, and\nfive or six large sous.\n\nThenardier thrust out his lower lip with a significant twist of the\nneck.\n\n\"You knocked him over cheap,\" said he.\n\nHe set to feeling the pockets of Jean Valjean and Marius, with the\ngreatest familiarity. Jean Valjean, who was chiefly concerned in keeping\nhis back to the light, let him have his way.\n\nWhile handling Marius' coat, Thenardier, with the skill of a pickpocket,\nand without being noticed by Jean Valjean, tore off a strip which he\nconcealed under his blouse, probably thinking that this morsel of\nstuff might serve, later on, to identify the assassinated man and the\nassassin. However, he found no more than the thirty francs.\n\n\"That's true,\" said he, \"both of you together have no more than that.\"\n\nAnd, forgetting his motto: \"half shares,\" he took all.\n\nHe hesitated a little over the large sous. After due reflection, he took\nthem also, muttering:\n\n\"Never mind! You cut folks' throats too cheap altogether.\"\n\nThat done, he once more drew the big key from under his blouse.\n\n\"Now, my friend, you must leave. It's like the fair here, you pay when\nyou go out. You have paid, now clear out.\"\n\nAnd he began to laugh.\n\nHad he, in lending to this stranger the aid of his key, and in making\nsome other man than himself emerge from that portal, the pure and\ndisinterested intention of rescuing an assassin? We may be permitted to\ndoubt this.\n\nThenardier helped Jean Valjean to replace Marius on his shoulders, then\nhe betook himself to the grating on tiptoe, and barefooted, making Jean\nValjean a sign to follow him, looked out, laid his finger on his mouth,\nand remained for several seconds, as though in suspense; his inspection\nfinished, he placed the key in the lock. The bolt slipped back and the\ngate swung open. It neither grated nor squeaked. It moved very softly.\n\nIt was obvious that this gate and those hinges, carefully oiled, were\nin the habit of opening more frequently than was supposed. This\nsoftness was suspicious; it hinted at furtive goings and comings, silent\nentrances and exits of nocturnal men, and the wolf-like tread of crime.\n\nThe sewer was evidently an accomplice of some mysterious band. This\ntaciturn grating was a receiver of stolen goods.\n\nThenardier opened the gate a little way, allowing just sufficient space\nfor Jean Valjean to pass out, closed the grating again, gave the key\na double turn in the lock and plunged back into the darkness, without\nmaking any more noise than a breath. He seemed to walk with the velvet\npaws of a tiger.\n\nA moment later, that hideous providence had retreated into the\ninvisibility.\n\nJean Valjean found himself in the open air.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX--MARIUS PRODUCES ON SOME ONE WHO IS A JUDGE OF THE MATTER,\nTHE EFFECT OF BEING DEAD\n\nHe allowed Marius to slide down upon the shore.\n\nThey were in the open air!\n\nThe miasmas, darkness, horror lay behind him. The pure, healthful,\nliving, joyous air that was easy to breathe inundated him. Everywhere\naround him reigned silence, but that charming silence when the sun has\nset in an unclouded azure sky. Twilight had descended; night was drawing\non, the great deliverer, the friend of all those who need a mantle of\ndarkness that they may escape from an anguish. The sky presented itself\nin all directions like an enormous calm. The river flowed to his feet\nwith the sound of a kiss. The aerial dialogue of the nests bidding each\nother good night in the elms of the Champs-Elysees was audible. A few\nstars, daintily piercing the pale blue of the zenith, and visible to\nrevery alone, formed imperceptible little splendors amid the immensity.\nEvening was unfolding over the head of Jean Valjean all the sweetness of\nthe infinite.\n\nIt was that exquisite and undecided hour which says neither yes nor no.\nNight was already sufficiently advanced to render it possible to lose\noneself at a little distance and yet there was sufficient daylight to\npermit of recognition at close quarters.\n\nFor several seconds, Jean Valjean was irresistibly overcome by that\naugust and caressing serenity; such moments of oblivion do come to men;\nsuffering refrains from harassing the unhappy wretch; everything is\neclipsed in the thoughts; peace broods over the dreamer like night; and,\nbeneath the twilight which beams and in imitation of the sky which is\nilluminated, the soul becomes studded with stars. Jean Valjean could\nnot refrain from contemplating that vast, clear shadow which rested\nover him; thoughtfully he bathed in the sea of ecstasy and prayer in the\nmajestic silence of the eternal heavens. Then he bent down swiftly\nto Marius, as though the sentiment of duty had returned to him, and,\ndipping up water in the hollow of his hand, he gently sprinkled a\nfew drops on the latter's face. Marius' eyelids did not open; but his\nhalf-open mouth still breathed.\n\nJean Valjean was on the point of dipping his hand in the river once\nmore, when, all at once, he experienced an indescribable embarrassment,\nsuch as a person feels when there is some one behind him whom he does\nnot see.\n\nWe have already alluded to this impression, with which everyone is\nfamiliar.\n\nHe turned round.\n\nSome one was, in fact, behind him, as there had been a short while\nbefore.\n\nA man of lofty stature, enveloped in a long coat, with folded arms,\nand bearing in his right fist a bludgeon of which the leaden head was\nvisible, stood a few paces in the rear of the spot where Jean Valjean\nwas crouching over Marius.\n\nWith the aid of the darkness, it seemed a sort of apparition. An\nordinary man would have been alarmed because of the twilight, a\nthoughtful man on account of the bludgeon. Jean Valjean recognized\nJavert.\n\nThe reader has divined, no doubt, that Thenardier's pursuer was no other\nthan Javert. Javert, after his unlooked-for escape from the barricade,\nhad betaken himself to the prefecture of police, had rendered a\nverbal account to the Prefect in person in a brief audience, had then\nimmediately gone on duty again, which implied--the note, the reader will\nrecollect, which had been captured on his person--a certain surveillance\nof the shore on the right bank of the Seine near the Champs-Elysees,\nwhich had, for some time past, aroused the attention of the police.\nThere he had caught sight of Thenardier and had followed him. The reader\nknows the rest.\n\nThus it will be easily understood that that grating, so obligingly\nopened to Jean Valjean, was a bit of cleverness on Thenardier's part.\nThenardier intuitively felt that Javert was still there; the man spied\nupon has a scent which never deceives him; it was necessary to fling\na bone to that sleuth-hound. An assassin, what a godsend! Such an\nopportunity must never be allowed to slip. Thenardier, by putting Jean\nValjean outside in his stead, provided a prey for the police, forced\nthem to relinquish his scent, made them forget him in a bigger\nadventure, repaid Javert for his waiting, which always flatters a spy,\nearned thirty francs, and counted with certainty, so far as he himself\nwas concerned, on escaping with the aid of this diversion.\n\nJean Valjean had fallen from one danger upon another.\n\nThese two encounters, this falling one after the other, from Thenardier\nupon Javert, was a rude shock.\n\nJavert did not recognize Jean Valjean, who, as we have stated, no longer\nlooked like himself. He did not unfold his arms, he made sure of his\nbludgeon in his fist, by an imperceptible movement, and said in a curt,\ncalm voice:\n\n\"Who are you?\"\n\n\"I.\"\n\n\"Who is 'I'?\"\n\n\"Jean Valjean.\"\n\nJavert thrust his bludgeon between his teeth, bent his knees, inclined\nhis body, laid his two powerful hands on the shoulders of Jean Valjean,\nwhich were clamped within them as in a couple of vices, scrutinized\nhim, and recognized him. Their faces almost touched. Javert's look was\nterrible.\n\nJean Valjean remained inert beneath Javert's grasp, like a lion\nsubmitting to the claws of a lynx.\n\n\"Inspector Javert,\" said he, \"you have me in your power. Moreover, I\nhave regarded myself as your prisoner ever since this morning. I did not\ngive you my address with any intention of escaping from you. Take me.\nOnly grant me one favor.\"\n\nJavert did not appear to hear him. He kept his eyes riveted on Jean\nValjean. His chin being contracted, thrust his lips upwards towards\nhis nose, a sign of savage revery. At length he released Jean Valjean,\nstraightened himself stiffly up without bending, grasped his bludgeon\nagain firmly, and, as though in a dream, he murmured rather than uttered\nthis question:\n\n\"What are you doing here? And who is this man?\"\n\nHe still abstained from addressing Jean Valjean as thou.\n\nJean Valjean replied, and the sound of his voice appeared to rouse\nJavert:\n\n\"It is with regard to him that I desire to speak to you. Dispose of me\nas you see fit; but first help me to carry him home. That is all that I\nask of you.\"\n\nJavert's face contracted as was always the case when any one seemed to\nthink him capable of making a concession. Nevertheless, he did not say\n\"no.\"\n\nAgain he bent over, drew from his pocket a handkerchief which\nhe moistened in the water and with which he then wiped Marius'\nblood-stained brow.\n\n\"This man was at the barricade,\" said he in a low voice and as though\nspeaking to himself. \"He is the one they called Marius.\"\n\nA spy of the first quality, who had observed everything, listened to\neverything, and taken in everything, even when he thought that he was to\ndie; who had played the spy even in his agony, and who, with his elbows\nleaning on the first step of the sepulchre, had taken notes.\n\nHe seized Marius' hand and felt his pulse.\n\n\"He is wounded,\" said Jean Valjean.\n\n\"He is a dead man,\" said Javert.\n\nJean Valjean replied:\n\n\"No. Not yet.\"\n\n\"So you have brought him thither from the barricade?\" remarked Javert.\n\nHis preoccupation must indeed have been very profound for him not to\ninsist on this alarming rescue through the sewer, and for him not to\neven notice Jean Valjean's silence after his question.\n\nJean Valjean, on his side, seemed to have but one thought. He resumed:\n\n\"He lives in the Marais, Rue des Filles-du-Calvaire, with his\ngrandfather. I do not recollect his name.\"\n\nJean Valjean fumbled in Marius' coat, pulled out his pocket-book, opened\nit at the page which Marius had pencilled, and held it out to Javert.\n\nThere was still sufficient light to admit of reading. Besides this,\nJavert possessed in his eye the feline phosphorescence of night\nbirds. He deciphered the few lines written by Marius, and muttered:\n\"Gillenormand, Rue des Filles-du Calvaire, No. 6.\"\n\nThen he exclaimed: \"Coachman!\"\n\nThe reader will remember that the hackney-coach was waiting in case of\nneed.\n\nJavert kept Marius' pocket-book.\n\nA moment later, the carriage, which had descended by the inclined plane\nof the watering-place, was on the shore. Marius was laid upon the back\nseat, and Javert seated himself on the front seat beside Jean Valjean.\n\nThe door slammed, and the carriage drove rapidly away, ascending the\nquays in the direction of the Bastille.\n\nThey quitted the quays and entered the streets. The coachman, a black\nform on his box, whipped up his thin horses. A glacial silence reigned\nin the carriage. Marius, motionless, with his body resting in the\ncorner, and his head drooping on his breast, his arms hanging, his legs\nstiff, seemed to be awaiting only a coffin; Jean Valjean seemed made of\nshadow, and Javert of stone, and in that vehicle full of night, whose\ninterior, every time that it passed in front of a street lantern,\nappeared to be turned lividly wan, as by an intermittent flash of\nlightning, chance had united and seemed to be bringing face to face\nthe three forms of tragic immobility, the corpse, the spectre, and the\nstatue.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X--RETURN OF THE SON WHO WAS PRODIGAL OF HIS LIFE\n\nAt every jolt over the pavement, a drop of blood trickled from Marius'\nhair.\n\nNight had fully closed in when the carriage arrived at No. 6, Rue des\nFilles-du-Calvaire.\n\nJavert was the first to alight; he made sure with one glance of the\nnumber on the carriage gate, and, raising the heavy knocker of beaten\niron, embellished in the old style, with a male goat and a satyr\nconfronting each other, he gave a violent peal. The gate opened a little\nway and Javert gave it a push. The porter half made his appearance\nyawning, vaguely awake, and with a candle in his hand.\n\nEveryone in the house was asleep. People go to bed betimes in the\nMarais, especially on days when there is a revolt. This good, old\nquarter, terrified at the Revolution, takes refuge in slumber, as\nchildren, when they hear the Bugaboo coming, hide their heads hastily\nunder their coverlet.\n\nIn the meantime Jean Valjean and the coachman had taken Marius out of\nthe carriage, Jean Valjean supporting him under the armpits, and the\ncoachman under the knees.\n\nAs they thus bore Marius, Jean Valjean slipped his hand under the\nlatter's clothes, which were broadly rent, felt his breast, and assured\nhimself that his heart was still beating. It was even beating a little\nless feebly, as though the movement of the carriage had brought about a\ncertain fresh access of life.\n\nJavert addressed the porter in a tone befitting the government, and the\npresence of the porter of a factious person.\n\n\"Some person whose name is Gillenormand?\"\n\n\"Here. What do you want with him?\"\n\n\"His son is brought back.\"\n\n\"His son?\" said the porter stupidly.\n\n\"He is dead.\"\n\nJean Valjean, who, soiled and tattered, stood behind Javert, and whom\nthe porter was surveying with some horror, made a sign to him with his\nhead that this was not so.\n\nThe porter did not appear to understand either Javert's words or Jean\nValjean's sign.\n\nJavert continued:\n\n\"He went to the barricade, and here he is.\"\n\n\"To the barricade?\" ejaculated the porter.\n\n\"He has got himself killed. Go waken his father.\"\n\nThe porter did not stir.\n\n\"Go along with you!\" repeated Javert.\n\nAnd he added:\n\n\"There will be a funeral here to-morrow.\"\n\nFor Javert, the usual incidents of the public highway were categorically\nclassed, which is the beginning of foresight and surveillance, and each\ncontingency had its own compartment; all possible facts were arranged\nin drawers, as it were, whence they emerged on occasion, in variable\nquantities; in the street, uproar, revolt, carnival, and funeral.\n\nThe porter contented himself with waking Basque. Basque woke Nicolette;\nNicolette roused great-aunt Gillenormand.\n\nAs for the grandfather, they let him sleep on, thinking that he would\nhear about the matter early enough in any case.\n\nMarius was carried up to the first floor, without any one in the other\nparts of the house being aware of the fact, and deposited on an old sofa\nin M. Gillenormand's antechamber; and while Basque went in search of a\nphysician, and while Nicolette opened the linen-presses, Jean Valjean\nfelt Javert touch him on the shoulder. He understood and descended the\nstairs, having behind him the step of Javert who was following him.\n\nThe porter watched them take their departure as he had watched their\narrival, in terrified somnolence.\n\nThey entered the carriage once more, and the coachman mounted his box.\n\n\"Inspector Javert,\" said Jean, \"grant me yet another favor.\"\n\n\"What is it?\" demanded Javert roughly.\n\n\"Let me go home for one instant. Then you shall do whatever you like\nwith me.\"\n\nJavert remained silent for a few moments, with his chin drawn back into\nthe collar of his great-coat, then he lowered the glass and front:\n\n\"Driver,\" said he, \"Rue de l'Homme Arme, No. 7.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI--CONCUSSION IN THE ABSOLUTE\n\nThey did not open their lips again during the whole space of their ride.\n\nWhat did Jean Valjean want? To finish what he had begun; to warn\nCosette, to tell her where Marius was, to give her, possibly, some other\nuseful information, to take, if he could, certain final measures. As\nfor himself, so far as he was personally concerned, all was over; he had\nbeen seized by Javert and had not resisted; any other man than himself\nin like situation would, perhaps, have had some vague thoughts connected\nwith the rope which Thenardier had given him, and of the bars of the\nfirst cell that he should enter; but, let us impress it upon the\nreader, after the Bishop, there had existed in Jean Valjean a profound\nhesitation in the presence of any violence, even when directed against\nhimself.\n\nSuicide, that mysterious act of violence against the unknown which may\ncontain, in a measure, the death of the soul, was impossible to Jean\nValjean.\n\nAt the entrance to the Rue de l'Homme Arme, the carriage halted, the way\nbeing too narrow to admit of the entrance of vehicles. Javert and Jean\nValjean alighted.\n\nThe coachman humbly represented to \"monsieur l'Inspecteur,\" that the\nUtrecht velvet of his carriage was all spotted with the blood of the\nassassinated man, and with mire from the assassin. That is the way he\nunderstood it. He added that an indemnity was due him. At the same time,\ndrawing his certificate book from his pocket, he begged the inspector to\nhave the goodness to write him \"a bit of an attestation.\"\n\nJavert thrust aside the book which the coachman held out to him, and\nsaid:\n\n\"How much do you want, including your time of waiting and the drive?\"\n\n\"It comes to seven hours and a quarter,\" replied the man, \"and my velvet\nwas perfectly new. Eighty francs, Mr. Inspector.\"\n\nJavert drew four napoleons from his pocket and dismissed the carriage.\n\nJean Valjean fancied that it was Javert's intention to conduct him on\nfoot to the post of the Blancs-Manteaux or to the post of the Archives,\nboth of which are close at hand.\n\nThey entered the street. It was deserted as usual. Javert followed Jean\nValjean. They reached No. 7. Jean Valjean knocked. The door opened.\n\n\"It is well,\" said Javert. \"Go up stairs.\"\n\nHe added with a strange expression, and as though he were exerting an\neffort in speaking in this manner:\n\n\"I will wait for you here.\"\n\nJean Valjean looked at Javert. This mode of procedure was but little in\naccord with Javert's habits. However, he could not be greatly surprised\nthat Javert should now have a sort of haughty confidence in him, the\nconfidence of the cat which grants the mouse liberty to the length of\nits claws, seeing that Jean Valjean had made up his mind to surrender\nhimself and to make an end of it. He pushed open the door, entered the\nhouse, called to the porter who was in bed and who had pulled the cord\nfrom his couch: \"It is I!\" and ascended the stairs.\n\nOn arriving at the first floor, he paused. All sorrowful roads\nhave their stations. The window on the landing-place, which was a\nsash-window, was open. As in many ancient houses, the staircase got its\nlight from without and had a view on the street. The street-lantern,\nsituated directly opposite, cast some light on the stairs, and thus\neffected some economy in illumination.\n\nJean Valjean, either for the sake of getting the air, or mechanically,\nthrust his head out of this window. He leaned out over the street. It\nis short, and the lantern lighted it from end to end. Jean Valjean was\noverwhelmed with amazement; there was no longer any one there.\n\nJavert had taken his departure.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII--THE GRANDFATHER\n\nBasque and the porter had carried Marius into the drawing-room, as he\nstill lay stretched out, motionless, on the sofa upon which he had been\nplaced on his arrival. The doctor who had been sent for had hastened\nthither. Aunt Gillenormand had risen.\n\nAunt Gillenormand went and came, in affright, wringing her hands and\nincapable of doing anything but saying: \"Heavens! is it possible?\" At\ntimes she added: \"Everything will be covered with blood.\" When her first\nhorror had passed off, a certain philosophy of the situation penetrated\nher mind, and took form in the exclamation: \"It was bound to end in this\nway!\" She did not go so far as: \"I told you so!\" which is customary on\nthis sort of occasion. At the physician's orders, a camp bed had been\nprepared beside the sofa. The doctor examined Marius, and after having\nfound that his pulse was still beating, that the wounded man had no very\ndeep wound on his breast, and that the blood on the corners of his lips\nproceeded from his nostrils, he had him placed flat on the bed, without\na pillow, with his head on the same level as his body, and even a\ntrifle lower, and with his bust bare in order to facilitate respiration.\nMademoiselle Gillenormand, on perceiving that they were undressing\nMarius, withdrew. She set herself to telling her beads in her own\nchamber.\n\nThe trunk had not suffered any internal injury; a bullet, deadened by\nthe pocket-book, had turned aside and made the tour of his ribs with a\nhideous laceration, which was of no great depth, and consequently, not\ndangerous. The long, underground journey had completed the dislocation\nof the broken collar-bone, and the disorder there was serious. The arms\nhad been slashed with sabre cuts. Not a single scar disfigured his face;\nbut his head was fairly covered with cuts; what would be the result of\nthese wounds on the head? Would they stop short at the hairy cuticle, or\nwould they attack the brain? As yet, this could not be decided. A grave\nsymptom was that they had caused a swoon, and that people do not always\nrecover from such swoons. Moreover, the wounded man had been exhausted\nby hemorrhage. From the waist down, the barricade had protected the\nlower part of the body from injury.\n\nBasque and Nicolette tore up linen and prepared bandages; Nicolette\nsewed them, Basque rolled them. As lint was lacking, the doctor, for\nthe time being, arrested the bleeding with layers of wadding. Beside\nthe bed, three candles burned on a table where the case of surgical\ninstruments lay spread out. The doctor bathed Marius' face and hair with\ncold water. A full pail was reddened in an instant. The porter, candle\nin hand, lighted them.\n\nThe doctor seemed to be pondering sadly. From time to time, he made a\nnegative sign with his head, as though replying to some question which\nhe had inwardly addressed to himself.\n\nA bad sign for the sick man are these mysterious dialogues of the doctor\nwith himself.\n\nAt the moment when the doctor was wiping Marius' face, and lightly\ntouching his still closed eyes with his finger, a door opened at the end\nof the drawing-room, and a long, pallid figure made its appearance.\n\nThis was the grandfather.\n\nThe revolt had, for the past two days, deeply agitated, enraged and\nengrossed the mind of M. Gillenormand. He had not been able to sleep\non the previous night, and he had been in a fever all day long. In the\nevening, he had gone to bed very early, recommending that everything in\nthe house should be well barred, and he had fallen into a doze through\nsheer fatigue.\n\nOld men sleep lightly; M. Gillenormand's chamber adjoined the\ndrawing-room, and in spite of all the precautions that had been taken,\nthe noise had awakened him. Surprised at the rift of light which he\nsaw under his door, he had risen from his bed, and had groped his way\nthither.\n\nHe stood astonished on the threshold, one hand on the handle of the\nhalf-open door, with his head bent a little forward and quivering,\nhis body wrapped in a white dressing-gown, which was straight and as\ndestitute of folds as a winding-sheet; and he had the air of a phantom\nwho is gazing into a tomb.\n\nHe saw the bed, and on the mattress that young man, bleeding, white with\na waxen whiteness, with closed eyes and gaping mouth, and pallid lips,\nstripped to the waist, slashed all over with crimson wounds, motionless\nand brilliantly lighted up.\n\nThe grandfather trembled from head to foot as powerfully as ossified\nlimbs can tremble, his eyes, whose corneae were yellow on account of\nhis great age, were veiled in a sort of vitreous glitter, his whole\nface assumed in an instant the earthy angles of a skull, his arms fell\npendent, as though a spring had broken, and his amazement was betrayed\nby the outspreading of the fingers of his two aged hands, which quivered\nall over, his knees formed an angle in front, allowing, through\nthe opening in his dressing-gown, a view of his poor bare legs, all\nbristling with white hairs, and he murmured:\n\n\"Marius!\"\n\n\"Sir,\" said Basque, \"Monsieur has just been brought back. He went to the\nbarricade, and . . .\"\n\n\"He is dead!\" cried the old man in a terrible voice. \"Ah! The rascal!\"\n\nThen a sort of sepulchral transformation straightened up this\ncentenarian as erect as a young man.\n\n\"Sir,\" said he, \"you are the doctor. Begin by telling me one thing. He\nis dead, is he not?\"\n\nThe doctor, who was at the highest pitch of anxiety, remained silent.\n\nM. Gillenormand wrung his hands with an outburst of terrible laughter.\n\n\"He is dead! He is dead! He is dead! He has got himself killed on\nthe barricades! Out of hatred to me! He did that to spite me! Ah! You\nblood-drinker! This is the way he returns to me! Misery of my life, he\nis dead!\"\n\nHe went to the window, threw it wide open as though he were stifling,\nand, erect before the darkness, he began to talk into the street, to the\nnight:\n\n\"Pierced, sabred, exterminated, slashed, hacked in pieces! Just look at\nthat, the villain! He knew well that I was waiting for him, and that I\nhad had his room arranged, and that I had placed at the head of my bed\nhis portrait taken when he was a little child! He knew well that he had\nonly to come back, and that I had been recalling him for years, and that\nI remained by my fireside, with my hands on my knees, not knowing what\nto do, and that I was mad over it! You knew well, that you had but to\nreturn and to say: 'It is I,' and you would have been the master of the\nhouse, and that I should have obeyed you, and that you could have done\nwhatever you pleased with your old numskull of a grandfather! you knew\nthat well, and you said:\n\n\"No, he is a Royalist, I will not go! And you went to the barricades,\nand you got yourself killed out of malice! To revenge yourself for what\nI said to you about Monsieur le Duc de Berry. It is infamous! Go to bed\nthen and sleep tranquilly! he is dead, and this is my awakening.\"\n\nThe doctor, who was beginning to be uneasy in both quarters, quitted\nMarius for a moment, went to M. Gillenormand, and took his arm.\nThe grandfather turned round, gazed at him with eyes which seemed\nexaggerated in size and bloodshot, and said to him calmly:\n\n\"I thank you, sir. I am composed, I am a man, I witnessed the death of\nLouis XVI., I know how to bear events. One thing is terrible and that is\nto think that it is your newspapers which do all the mischief. You will\nhave scribblers, chatterers, lawyers, orators, tribunes, discussions,\nprogress, enlightenment, the rights of man, the liberty of the press,\nand this is the way that your children will be brought home to you. Ah!\nMarius! It is abominable! Killed! Dead before me! A barricade! Ah, the\nscamp! Doctor, you live in this quarter, I believe? Oh! I know you well.\nI see your cabriolet pass my window. I am going to tell you. You are\nwrong to think that I am angry. One does not fly into a rage against a\ndead man. That would be stupid. This is a child whom I have reared.\nI was already old while he was very young. He played in the Tuileries\ngarden with his little shovel and his little chair, and in order that\nthe inspectors might not grumble, I stopped up the holes that he made in\nthe earth with his shovel, with my cane. One day he exclaimed: Down with\nLouis XVIII.! and off he went. It was no fault of mine. He was all rosy\nand blond. His mother is dead. Have you ever noticed that all little\nchildren are blond? Why is it so? He is the son of one of those brigands\nof the Loire, but children are innocent of their fathers' crimes.\nI remember when he was no higher than that. He could not manage\nto pronounce his Ds. He had a way of talking that was so sweet and\nindistinct that you would have thought it was a bird chirping. I\nremember that once, in front of the Hercules Farnese, people formed a\ncircle to admire him and marvel at him, he was so handsome, was that\nchild! He had a head such as you see in pictures. I talked in a deep\nvoice, and I frightened him with my cane, but he knew very well that it\nwas only to make him laugh. In the morning, when he entered my room, I\ngrumbled, but he was like the sunlight to me, all the same. One cannot\ndefend oneself against those brats. They take hold of you, they hold you\nfast, they never let you go again. The truth is, that there never was a\ncupid like that child. Now, what can you say for your Lafayettes, your\nBenjamin Constants, and your Tirecuir de Corcelles who have killed him?\nThis cannot be allowed to pass in this fashion.\"\n\nHe approached Marius, who still lay livid and motionless, and to whom\nthe physician had returned, and began once more to wring his hands. The\nold man's pallid lips moved as though mechanically, and permitted the\npassage of words that were barely audible, like breaths in the death\nagony:\n\n\"Ah! heartless lad! Ah! clubbist! Ah! wretch! Ah! Septembrist!\"\n\nReproaches in the low voice of an agonizing man, addressed to a corpse.\n\nLittle by little, as it is always indispensable that internal eruptions\nshould come to the light, the sequence of words returned, but the\ngrandfather appeared no longer to have the strength to utter them, his\nvoice was so weak, and extinct, that it seemed to come from the other\nside of an abyss:\n\n\"It is all the same to me, I am going to die too, that I am. And\nto think that there is not a hussy in Paris who would not have been\ndelighted to make this wretch happy! A scamp who, instead of amusing\nhimself and enjoying life, went off to fight and get himself shot down\nlike a brute! And for whom? Why? For the Republic! Instead of going to\ndance at the Chaumiere, as it is the duty of young folks to do! What's\nthe use of being twenty years old? The Republic, a cursed pretty folly!\nPoor mothers, beget fine boys, do! Come, he is dead. That will make two\nfunerals under the same carriage gate. So you have got yourself arranged\nlike this for the sake of General Lamarque's handsome eyes! What had\nthat General Lamarque done to you? A slasher! A chatter-box! To get\noneself killed for a dead man! If that isn't enough to drive any one\nmad! Just think of it! At twenty! And without so much as turning his\nhead to see whether he was not leaving something behind him! That's the\nway poor, good old fellows are forced to die alone, now-adays. Perish\nin your corner, owl! Well, after all, so much the better, that is what\nI was hoping for, this will kill me on the spot. I am too old, I am\na hundred years old, I am a hundred thousand years old, I ought, by\nrights, to have been dead long ago. This blow puts an end to it. So all\nis over, what happiness! What is the good of making him inhale ammonia\nand all that parcel of drugs? You are wasting your trouble, you fool of\na doctor! Come, he's dead, completely dead. I know all about it, I\nam dead myself too. He hasn't done things by half. Yes, this age is\ninfamous, infamous and that's what I think of you, of your ideas, of\nyour systems, of your masters, of your oracles, of your doctors, of your\nscape-graces of writers, of your rascally philosophers, and of all the\nrevolutions which, for the last sixty years, have been frightening\nthe flocks of crows in the Tuileries! But you were pitiless in getting\nyourself killed like this, I shall not even grieve over your death, do\nyou understand, you assassin?\"\n\nAt that moment, Marius slowly opened his eyes, and his glance, still\ndimmed by lethargic wonder, rested on M. Gillenormand.\n\n\"Marius!\" cried the old man. \"Marius! My little Marius! my child! my\nwell-beloved son! You open your eyes, you gaze upon me, you are alive,\nthanks!\"\n\nAnd he fell fainting.\n\n\n\n\nBOOK FOURTH.--JAVERT DERAILED\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I--JAVERT\n\nJavert passed slowly down the Rue de l'Homme Arme.\n\nHe walked with drooping head for the first time in his life, and\nlikewise, for the first time in his life, with his hands behind his\nback.\n\nUp to that day, Javert had borrowed from Napoleon's attitudes, only that\nwhich is expressive of resolution, with arms folded across the chest;\nthat which is expressive of uncertainty--with the hands behind the\nback--had been unknown to him. Now, a change had taken place; his whole\nperson, slow and sombre, was stamped with anxiety.\n\nHe plunged into the silent streets.\n\nNevertheless, he followed one given direction.\n\nHe took the shortest cut to the Seine, reached the Quai des Ormes,\nskirted the quay, passed the Greve, and halted at some distance from\nthe post of the Place du Chatelet, at the angle of the Pont Notre-Dame.\nThere, between the Notre-Dame and the Pont au Change on the one hand,\nand the Quai de la Megisserie and the Quai aux Fleurs on the other, the\nSeine forms a sort of square lake, traversed by a rapid.\n\nThis point of the Seine is dreaded by mariners. Nothing is more\ndangerous than this rapid, hemmed in, at that epoch, and irritated by\nthe piles of the mill on the bridge, now demolished. The two bridges,\nsituated thus close together, augment the peril; the water hurries in\nformidable wise through the arches. It rolls in vast and terrible waves;\nit accumulates and piles up there; the flood attacks the piles of the\nbridges as though in an effort to pluck them up with great liquid ropes.\nMen who fall in there never re-appear; the best of swimmers are drowned\nthere.\n\nJavert leaned both elbows on the parapet, his chin resting in both\nhands, and, while his nails were mechanically twined in the abundance of\nhis whiskers, he meditated.\n\nA novelty, a revolution, a catastrophe had just taken place in the\ndepths of his being; and he had something upon which to examine himself.\n\nJavert was undergoing horrible suffering.\n\nFor several hours, Javert had ceased to be simple. He was troubled;\nthat brain, so limpid in its blindness, had lost its transparency; that\ncrystal was clouded. Javert felt duty divided within his conscience, and\nhe could not conceal the fact from himself. When he had so unexpectedly\nencountered Jean Valjean on the banks of the Seine, there had been in\nhim something of the wolf which regains his grip on his prey, and of the\ndog who finds his master again.\n\nHe beheld before him two paths, both equally straight, but he beheld\ntwo; and that terrified him; him, who had never in all his life known\nmore than one straight line. And, the poignant anguish lay in this, that\nthe two paths were contrary to each other. One of these straight lines\nexcluded the other. Which of the two was the true one?\n\nHis situation was indescribable.\n\nTo owe his life to a malefactor, to accept that debt and to repay it; to\nbe, in spite of himself, on a level with a fugitive from justice, and to\nrepay his service with another service; to allow it to be said to him,\n\"Go,\" and to say to the latter in his turn: \"Be free\"; to sacrifice to\npersonal motives duty, that general obligation, and to be conscious,\nin those personal motives, of something that was also general, and,\nperchance, superior, to betray society in order to remain true to his\nconscience; that all these absurdities should be realized and should\naccumulate upon him,--this was what overwhelmed him.\n\nOne thing had amazed him,--this was that Jean Valjean should have done\nhim a favor, and one thing petrified him,--that he, Javert, should have\ndone Jean Valjean a favor.\n\nWhere did he stand? He sought to comprehend his position, and could no\nlonger find his bearings.\n\nWhat was he to do now? To deliver up Jean Valjean was bad; to leave Jean\nValjean at liberty was bad. In the first case, the man of authority fell\nlower than the man of the galleys, in the second, a convict rose above\nthe law, and set his foot upon it. In both cases, dishonor for him,\nJavert. There was disgrace in any resolution at which he might arrive.\nDestiny has some extremities which rise perpendicularly from the\nimpossible, and beyond which life is no longer anything but a precipice.\nJavert had reached one of those extremities.\n\nOne of his anxieties consisted in being constrained to think. The very\nviolence of all these conflicting emotions forced him to it. Thought was\nsomething to which he was unused, and which was peculiarly painful.\n\nIn thought there always exists a certain amount of internal rebellion;\nand it irritated him to have that within him.\n\nThought on any subject whatever, outside of the restricted circle of his\nfunctions, would have been for him in any case useless and a fatigue;\nthought on the day which had just passed was a torture. Nevertheless, it\nwas indispensable that he should take a look into his conscience, after\nsuch shocks, and render to himself an account of himself.\n\nWhat he had just done made him shudder. He, Javert, had seen fit to\ndecide, contrary to all the regulations of the police, contrary to the\nwhole social and judicial organization, contrary to the entire code,\nupon a release; this had suited him; he had substituted his own affairs\nfor the affairs of the public; was not this unjustifiable? Every time\nthat he brought himself face to face with this deed without a name which\nhe had committed, he trembled from head to foot. Upon what should he\ndecide? One sole resource remained to him; to return in all haste to\nthe Rue de l'Homme Arme, and commit Jean Valjean to prison. It was clear\nthat that was what he ought to do. He could not.\n\nSomething barred his way in that direction.\n\nSomething? What? Is there in the world, anything outside of the\ntribunals, executory sentences, the police and the authorities? Javert\nwas overwhelmed.\n\nA galley-slave sacred! A convict who could not be touched by the law!\nAnd that the deed of Javert!\n\nWas it not a fearful thing that Javert and Jean Valjean, the man made to\nproceed with vigor, the man made to submit,--that these two men who were\nboth the things of the law, should have come to such a pass, that both\nof them had set themselves above the law? What then! such enormities\nwere to happen and no one was to be punished! Jean Valjean, stronger\nthan the whole social order, was to remain at liberty, and he, Javert,\nwas to go on eating the government's bread!\n\nHis revery gradually became terrible.\n\nHe might, athwart this revery, have also reproached himself on\nthe subject of that insurgent who had been taken to the Rue des\nFilles-du-Calvaire; but he never even thought of that. The lesser fault\nwas lost in the greater. Besides, that insurgent was, obviously, a dead\nman, and, legally, death puts an end to pursuit.\n\nJean Valjean was the load which weighed upon his spirit.\n\nJean Valjean disconcerted him. All the axioms which had served him as\npoints of support all his life long, had crumbled away in the presence\nof this man. Jean Valjean's generosity towards him, Javert, crushed him.\nOther facts which he now recalled, and which he had formerly treated\nas lies and folly, now recurred to him as realities. M. Madeleine\nre-appeared behind Jean Valjean, and the two figures were superposed in\nsuch fashion that they now formed but one, which was venerable. Javert\nfelt that something terrible was penetrating his soul--admiration for\na convict. Respect for a galley-slave--is that a possible thing? He\nshuddered at it, yet could not escape from it. In vain did he struggle,\nhe was reduced to confess, in his inmost heart, the sublimity of that\nwretch. This was odious.\n\nA benevolent malefactor, merciful, gentle, helpful, clement, a convict,\nreturning good for evil, giving back pardon for hatred, preferring pity\nto vengeance, preferring to ruin himself rather than to ruin his enemy,\nsaving him who had smitten him, kneeling on the heights of virtue, more\nnearly akin to an angel than to a man. Javert was constrained to admit\nto himself that this monster existed.\n\nThings could not go on in this manner.\n\nCertainly, and we insist upon this point, he had not yielded without\nresistance to that monster, to that infamous angel, to that hideous\nhero, who enraged almost as much as he amazed him. Twenty times, as he\nsat in that carriage face to face with Jean Valjean, the legal tiger had\nroared within him. A score of times he had been tempted to fling himself\nupon Jean Valjean, to seize him and devour him, that is to say, to\narrest him. What more simple, in fact? To cry out at the first post that\nthey passed:--\"Here is a fugitive from justice, who has broken his ban!\"\nto summon the gendarmes and say to them: \"This man is yours!\" then to\ngo off, leaving that condemned man there, to ignore the rest and not to\nmeddle further in the matter. This man is forever a prisoner of the law;\nthe law may do with him what it will. What could be more just? Javert\nhad said all this to himself; he had wished to pass beyond, to act, to\napprehend the man, and then, as at present, he had not been able to do\nit; and every time that his arm had been raised convulsively towards\nJean Valjean's collar, his hand had fallen back again, as beneath an\nenormous weight, and in the depths of his thought he had heard a voice,\na strange voice crying to him:--\"It is well. Deliver up your savior.\nThen have the basin of Pontius Pilate brought and wash your claws.\"\n\nThen his reflections reverted to himself and beside Jean Valjean\nglorified he beheld himself, Javert, degraded.\n\nA convict was his benefactor!\n\nBut then, why had he permitted that man to leave him alive? He had\nthe right to be killed in that barricade. He should have asserted that\nright. It would have been better to summon the other insurgents to his\nsuccor against Jean Valjean, to get himself shot by force.\n\nHis supreme anguish was the loss of certainty. He felt that he had been\nuprooted. The code was no longer anything more than a stump in his hand.\nHe had to deal with scruples of an unknown species. There had taken\nplace within him a sentimental revelation entirely distinct from legal\naffirmation, his only standard of measurement hitherto. To remain in his\nformer uprightness did not suffice. A whole order of unexpected facts\nhad cropped up and subjugated him. A whole new world was dawning on\nhis soul: kindness accepted and repaid, devotion, mercy, indulgence,\nviolences committed by pity on austerity, respect for persons, no more\ndefinitive condemnation, no more conviction, the possibility of a tear\nin the eye of the law, no one knows what justice according to God,\nrunning in inverse sense to justice according to men. He perceived amid\nthe shadows the terrible rising of an unknown moral sun; it horrified\nand dazzled him. An owl forced to the gaze of an eagle.\n\nHe said to himself that it was true that there were exceptional cases,\nthat authority might be put out of countenance, that the rule might\nbe inadequate in the presence of a fact, that everything could not\nbe framed within the text of the code, that the unforeseen compelled\nobedience, that the virtue of a convict might set a snare for the virtue\nof the functionary, that destiny did indulge in such ambushes, and\nhe reflected with despair that he himself had not even been fortified\nagainst a surprise.\n\nHe was forced to acknowledge that goodness did exist. This convict had\nbeen good. And he himself, unprecedented circumstance, had just been\ngood also. So he was becoming depraved.\n\nHe found that he was a coward. He conceived a horror of himself.\n\nJavert's ideal, was not to be human, to be grand, to be sublime; it was\nto be irreproachable.\n\nNow, he had just failed in this.\n\nHow had he come to such a pass? How had all this happened? He could not\nhave told himself. He clasped his head in both hands, but in spite of\nall that he could do, he could not contrive to explain it to himself.\n\nHe had certainly always entertained the intention of restoring Jean\nValjean to the law of which Jean Valjean was the captive, and of which\nhe, Javert, was the slave. Not for a single instant while he held him\nin his grasp had he confessed to himself that he entertained the idea of\nreleasing him. It was, in some sort, without his consciousness, that his\nhand had relaxed and had let him go free.\n\nAll sorts of interrogation points flashed before his eyes. He put\nquestions to himself, and made replies to himself, and his replies\nfrightened him. He asked himself: \"What has that convict done, that\ndesperate fellow, whom I have pursued even to persecution, and who has\nhad me under his foot, and who could have avenged himself, and who\nowed it both to his rancor and to his safety, in leaving me my life, in\nshowing mercy upon me? His duty? No. Something more. And I in showing\nmercy upon him in my turn--what have I done? My duty? No. Something\nmore. So there is something beyond duty?\" Here he took fright; his\nbalance became disjointed; one of the scales fell into the abyss, the\nother rose heavenward, and Javert was no less terrified by the one which\nwas on high than by the one which was below. Without being in the least\nin the world what is called Voltairian or a philosopher, or incredulous,\nbeing, on the contrary, respectful by instinct, towards the established\nchurch, he knew it only as an august fragment of the social whole; order\nwas his dogma, and sufficed for him; ever since he had attained to man's\nestate and the rank of a functionary, he had centred nearly all his\nreligion in the police. Being,--and here we employ words without the\nleast irony and in their most serious acceptation, being, as we have\nsaid, a spy as other men are priests. He had a superior, M. Gisquet; up\nto that day he had never dreamed of that other superior, God.\n\nThis new chief, God, he became unexpectedly conscious of, and he felt\nembarrassed by him. This unforeseen presence threw him off his bearings;\nhe did not know what to do with this superior, he, who was not ignorant\nof the fact that the subordinate is bound always to bow, that he must\nnot disobey, nor find fault, nor discuss, and that, in the presence of a\nsuperior who amazes him too greatly, the inferior has no other resource\nthan that of handing in his resignation.\n\nBut how was he to set about handing in his resignation to God?\n\nHowever things might stand,--and it was to this point that he reverted\nconstantly,--one fact dominated everything else for him, and that was,\nthat he had just committed a terrible infraction of the law. He had just\nshut his eyes on an escaped convict who had broken his ban. He had just\nset a galley-slave at large. He had just robbed the laws of a man who\nbelonged to them. That was what he had done. He no longer understood\nhimself. The very reasons for his action escaped him; only their vertigo\nwas left with him. Up to that moment he had lived with that blind faith\nwhich gloomy probity engenders. This faith had quitted him, this probity\nhad deserted him. All that he had believed in melted away. Truths which\nhe did not wish to recognize were besieging him, inexorably. Henceforth,\nhe must be a different man. He was suffering from the strange pains of\na conscience abruptly operated on for the cataract. He saw that which\nit was repugnant to him to behold. He felt himself emptied, useless, put\nout of joint with his past life, turned out, dissolved. Authority was\ndead within him. He had no longer any reason for existing.\n\nA terrible situation! to be touched.\n\nTo be granite and to doubt! to be the statue of Chastisement cast in one\npiece in the mould of the law, and suddenly to become aware of the fact\nthat one cherishes beneath one's breast of bronze something absurd\nand disobedient which almost resembles a heart! To come to the pass of\nreturning good for good, although one has said to oneself up to that day\nthat that good is evil! to be the watch-dog, and to lick the intruder's\nhand! to be ice and melt! to be the pincers and to turn into a hand!\nto suddenly feel one's fingers opening! to relax one's grip,--what a\nterrible thing!\n\nThe man-projectile no longer acquainted with his route and retreating!\n\nTo be obliged to confess this to oneself: infallibility is not\ninfallible, there may exist error in the dogma, all has not been said\nwhen a code speaks, society is not perfect, authority is complicated\nwith vacillation, a crack is possible in the immutable, judges are but\nmen, the law may err, tribunals may make a mistake! to behold a rift in\nthe immense blue pane of the firmament!\n\nThat which was passing in Javert was the Fampoux of a rectilinear\nconscience, the derailment of a soul, the crushing of a probity which\nhad been irresistibly launched in a straight line and was breaking\nagainst God. It certainly was singular that the stoker of order, that\nthe engineer of authority, mounted on the blind iron horse with its\nrigid road, could be unseated by a flash of light! that the immovable,\nthe direct, the correct, the geometrical, the passive, the perfect,\ncould bend! that there should exist for the locomotive a road to\nDamascus!\n\nGod, always within man, and refractory, He, the true conscience, to the\nfalse; a prohibition to the spark to die out; an order to the ray to\nremember the sun; an injunction to the soul to recognize the veritable\nabsolute when confronted with the fictitious absolute, humanity\nwhich cannot be lost; the human heart indestructible; that splendid\nphenomenon, the finest, perhaps, of all our interior marvels, did Javert\nunderstand this? Did Javert penetrate it? Did Javert account for it\nto himself? Evidently he did not. But beneath the pressure of that\nincontestable incomprehensibility he felt his brain bursting.\n\nHe was less the man transfigured than the victim of this prodigy. In all\nthis he perceived only the tremendous difficulty of existence. It seemed\nto him that, henceforth, his respiration was repressed forever. He was\nnot accustomed to having something unknown hanging over his head.\n\nUp to this point, everything above him had been, to his gaze, merely a\nsmooth, limpid and simple surface; there was nothing incomprehensible,\nnothing obscure; nothing that was not defined, regularly disposed,\nlinked, precise, circumscribed, exact, limited, closed, fully provided\nfor; authority was a plane surface; there was no fall in it, no\ndizziness in its presence. Javert had never beheld the unknown except\nfrom below. The irregular, the unforeseen, the disordered opening of\nchaos, the possible slip over a precipice--this was the work of the\nlower regions, of rebels, of the wicked, of wretches. Now Javert threw\nhimself back, and he was suddenly terrified by this unprecedented\napparition: a gulf on high.\n\nWhat! one was dismantled from top to bottom! one was disconcerted,\nabsolutely! In what could one trust! That which had been agreed upon was\ngiving way! What! the defect in society's armor could be discovered by\na magnanimous wretch! What! an honest servitor of the law could suddenly\nfind himself caught between two crimes--the crime of allowing a man to\nescape and the crime of arresting him! everything was not settled in\nthe orders given by the State to the functionary! There might be\nblind alleys in duty! What,--all this was real! was it true that an\nex-ruffian, weighed down with convictions, could rise erect and end by\nbeing in the right? Was this credible? were there cases in which the law\nshould retire before transfigured crime, and stammer its excuses?--Yes,\nthat was the state of the case! and Javert saw it! and Javert had\ntouched it! and not only could he not deny it, but he had taken part\nin it. These were realities. It was abominable that actual facts could\nreach such deformity. If facts did their duty, they would confine\nthemselves to being proofs of the law; facts--it is God who sends them.\nWas anarchy, then, on the point of now descending from on high?\n\nThus,--and in the exaggeration of anguish, and the optical illusion\nof consternation, all that might have corrected and restrained this\nimpression was effaced, and society, and the human race, and the\nuniverse were, henceforth, summed up in his eyes, in one simple and\nterrible feature,--thus the penal laws, the thing judged, the force due\nto legislation, the decrees of the sovereign courts, the magistracy,\nthe government, prevention, repression, official cruelty, wisdom, legal\ninfallibility, the principle of authority, all the dogmas on which rest\npolitical and civil security, sovereignty, justice, public truth, all\nthis was rubbish, a shapeless mass, chaos; he himself, Javert, the spy\nof order, incorruptibility in the service of the police, the bull-dog\nprovidence of society, vanquished and hurled to earth; and, erect, at\nthe summit of all that ruin, a man with a green cap on his head and a\nhalo round his brow; this was the astounding confusion to which he had\ncome; this was the fearful vision which he bore within his soul.\n\nWas this to be endured? No.\n\nA violent state, if ever such existed. There were only two ways of\nescaping from it. One was to go resolutely to Jean Valjean, and restore\nto his cell the convict from the galleys. The other . . .\n\nJavert quitted the parapet, and, with head erect this time, betook\nhimself, with a firm tread, towards the station-house indicated by a\nlantern at one of the corners of the Place du Chatelet.\n\nOn arriving there, he saw through the window a sergeant of police, and\nhe entered. Policemen recognize each other by the very way in which they\nopen the door of a station-house. Javert mentioned his name, showed his\ncard to the sergeant, and seated himself at the table of the post on\nwhich a candle was burning. On a table lay a pen, a leaden inkstand and\npaper, provided in the event of possible reports and the orders of the\nnight patrols. This table, still completed by its straw-seated chair,\nis an institution; it exists in all police stations; it is invariably\nornamented with a box-wood saucer filled with sawdust and a wafer box\nof cardboard filled with red wafers, and it forms the lowest stage of\nofficial style. It is there that the literature of the State has its\nbeginning.\n\nJavert took a pen and a sheet of paper, and began to write. This is what\nhe wrote:\n\n      A FEW OBSERVATIONS FOR THE GOOD OF THE SERVICE.\n\n\n \"In the first place:  I beg Monsieur le Prefet to cast his eyes\n on this.\n\n \"Secondly:  prisoners, on arriving after examination, take off\n their shoes and stand barefoot on the flagstones while they are\n being searched.  Many of them cough on their return to prison.\n This entails hospital expenses.\n\n \"Thirdly:  the mode of keeping track of a man with relays of police\n agents from distance to distance, is good, but, on important occasions,\n it is requisite that at least two agents should never lose sight\n of each other, so that, in case one agent should, for any cause,\n grow weak in his service, the other may supervise him and take\n his place.\n\n \"Fourthly:  it is inexplicable why the special regulation of the prison\n of the Madelonettes interdicts the prisoner from having a chair,\n even by paying for it.\n\n \"Fifthly:  in the Madelonettes there are only two bars to the canteen,\n so that the canteen woman can touch the prisoners with her hand.\n\n \"Sixthly:  the prisoners called barkers, who summon the other\n prisoners to the parlor, force the prisoner to pay them two sous\n to call his name distinctly.  This is a theft.\n\n \"Seventhly:  for a broken thread ten sous are withheld in the\n weaving shop; this is an abuse of the contractor, since the cloth\n is none the worse for it.\n\n \"Eighthly:  it is annoying for visitors to La Force to be\n obliged to traverse the boys' court in order to reach the parlor\n of Sainte-Marie-l'Egyptienne.\n\n \"Ninthly:  it is a fact that any day gendarmes can be overheard\n relating in the court-yard of the prefecture the interrogations put\n by the magistrates to prisoners.  For a gendarme, who should be\n sworn to secrecy, to repeat what he has heard in the examination\n room is a grave disorder.\n\n \"Tenthly:  Mme. Henry is an honest woman; her canteen is very neat;\n but it is bad to have a woman keep the wicket to the mouse-trap\n of the secret cells.  This is unworthy of the Conciergerie of a\n great civilization.\"\n\n Javert wrote these lines in his calmest and most correct chirography,\n not omitting a single comma, and making the paper screech under his pen.\n Below the last line he signed:\n\n                                               \"JAVERT,\n                                    \"Inspector of the 1st class.\n       \"The Post of the Place du Chatelet.\n                 \"June 7th, 1832, about one o'clock in the morning.\"\n\n\nJavert dried the fresh ink on the paper, folded it like a letter, sealed\nit, wrote on the back: Note for the administration, left it on the\ntable, and quitted the post. The glazed and grated door fell to behind\nhim.\n\nAgain he traversed the Place du Chatelet diagonally, regained the quay,\nand returned with automatic precision to the very point which he had\nabandoned a quarter of an hour previously, leaned on his elbows and\nfound himself again in the same attitude on the same paving-stone of the\nparapet. He did not appear to have stirred.\n\nThe darkness was complete. It was the sepulchral moment which follows\nmidnight. A ceiling of clouds concealed the stars. Not a single light\nburned in the houses of the city; no one was passing; all of the streets\nand quays which could be seen were deserted; Notre-Dame and the towers\nof the Court-House seemed features of the night. A street lantern\nreddened the margin of the quay. The outlines of the bridges lay\nshapeless in the mist one behind the other. Recent rains had swollen the\nriver.\n\nThe spot where Javert was leaning was, it will be remembered, situated\nprecisely over the rapids of the Seine, perpendicularly above that\nformidable spiral of whirlpools which loose and knot themselves again\nlike an endless screw.\n\nJavert bent his head and gazed. All was black. Nothing was to be\ndistinguished. A sound of foam was audible; but the river could not be\nseen. At moments, in that dizzy depth, a gleam of light appeared, and\nundulated vaguely, water possessing the power of taking light, no one\nknows whence, and converting it into a snake. The light vanished, and\nall became indistinct once more. Immensity seemed thrown open there.\nWhat lay below was not water, it was a gulf. The wall of the quay,\nabrupt, confused, mingled with the vapors, instantly concealed from\nsight, produced the effect of an escarpment of the infinite. Nothing was\nto be seen, but the hostile chill of the water and the stale odor of\nthe wet stones could be felt. A fierce breath rose from this abyss. The\nflood in the river, divined rather than perceived, the tragic whispering\nof the waves, the melancholy vastness of the arches of the bridge, the\nimaginable fall into that gloomy void, into all that shadow was full of\nhorror.\n\nJavert remained motionless for several minutes, gazing at this opening\nof shadow; he considered the invisible with a fixity that resembled\nattention. The water roared. All at once he took off his hat and placed\nit on the edge of the quay. A moment later, a tall black figure, which\na belated passer-by in the distance might have taken for a phantom,\nappeared erect upon the parapet of the quay, bent over towards the\nSeine, then drew itself up again, and fell straight down into the\nshadows; a dull splash followed; and the shadow alone was in the secret\nof the convulsions of that obscure form which had disappeared beneath\nthe water.\n\n\n\n\nBOOK FIFTH.--GRANDSON AND GRANDFATHER\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I--IN WHICH THE TREE WITH THE ZINC PLASTER APPEARS AGAIN\n\nSome time after the events which we have just recorded, Sieur\nBoulatruelle experienced a lively emotion.\n\nSieur Boulatruelle was that road-mender of Montfermeil whom the reader\nhas already seen in the gloomy parts of this book.\n\nBoulatruelle, as the reader may, perchance, recall, was a man who\nwas occupied with divers and troublesome matters. He broke stones and\ndamaged travellers on the highway.\n\nRoad-mender and thief as he was, he cherished one dream; he believed in\nthe treasures buried in the forest of Montfermeil. He hoped some day to\nfind the money in the earth at the foot of a tree; in the meanwhile, he\nlived to search the pockets of passers-by.\n\nNevertheless, for an instant, he was prudent. He had just escaped\nneatly. He had been, as the reader is aware, picked up in Jondrette's\ngarret in company with the other ruffians. Utility of a vice: his\ndrunkenness had been his salvation. The authorities had never been able\nto make out whether he had been there in the quality of a robber or a\nman who had been robbed. An order of nolle prosequi, founded on his well\nauthenticated state of intoxication on the evening of the ambush, had\nset him at liberty. He had taken to his heels. He had returned to his\nroad from Gagny to Lagny, to make, under administrative supervision,\nbroken stone for the good of the state, with downcast mien, in a very\npensive mood, his ardor for theft somewhat cooled; but he was addicted\nnone the less tenderly to the wine which had recently saved him.\n\nAs for the lively emotion which he had experienced a short time after\nhis return to his road-mender's turf-thatched cot, here it is:\n\nOne morning, Boulatruelle, while on his way as was his wont, to his\nwork, and possibly also to his ambush, a little before daybreak caught\nsight, through the branches of the trees, of a man, whose back alone\nhe saw, but the shape of whose shoulders, as it seemed to him at that\ndistance and in the early dusk, was not entirely unfamiliar to him.\nBoulatruelle, although intoxicated, had a correct and lucid memory, a\ndefensive arm that is indispensable to any one who is at all in conflict\nwith legal order.\n\n\"Where the deuce have I seen something like that man yonder?\" he said\nto himself. But he could make himself no answer, except that the man\nresembled some one of whom his memory preserved a confused trace.\n\nHowever, apart from the identity which he could not manage to catch,\nBoulatruelle put things together and made calculations. This man did\nnot belong in the country-side. He had just arrived there. On foot,\nevidently. No public conveyance passes through Montfermeil at that hour.\nHe had walked all night. Whence came he? Not from a very great distance;\nfor he had neither haversack, nor bundle. From Paris, no doubt. Why was\nhe in these woods? why was he there at such an hour? what had he come\nthere for?\n\nBoulatruelle thought of the treasure. By dint of ransacking his memory,\nhe recalled in a vague way that he had already, many years before, had\na similar alarm in connection with a man who produced on him the effect\nthat he might well be this very individual.\n\n\"By the deuce,\" said Boulatruelle, \"I'll find him again. I'll discover\nthe parish of that parishioner. This prowler of Patron-Minette has a\nreason, and I'll know it. People can't have secrets in my forest if I\ndon't have a finger in the pie.\"\n\nHe took his pick-axe which was very sharply pointed.\n\n\"There now,\" he grumbled, \"is something that will search the earth and a\nman.\"\n\nAnd, as one knots one thread to another thread, he took up the line of\nmarch at his best pace in the direction which the man must follow, and\nset out across the thickets.\n\nWhen he had compassed a hundred strides, the day, which was already\nbeginning to break, came to his assistance. Footprints stamped in the\nsand, weeds trodden down here and there, heather crushed, young branches\nin the brushwood bent and in the act of straightening themselves up\nagain with the graceful deliberation of the arms of a pretty woman who\nstretches herself when she wakes, pointed out to him a sort of track. He\nfollowed it, then lost it. Time was flying. He plunged deeper into the\nwoods and came to a sort of eminence. An early huntsman who was passing\nin the distance along a path, whistling the air of Guillery, suggested\nto him the idea of climbing a tree. Old as he was, he was agile. There\nstood close at hand a beech-tree of great size, worthy of Tityrus and of\nBoulatruelle. Boulatruelle ascended the beech as high as he was able.\n\nThe idea was a good one. On scrutinizing the solitary waste on the side\nwhere the forest is thoroughly entangled and wild, Boulatruelle suddenly\ncaught sight of his man.\n\nHardly had he got his eye upon him when he lost sight of him.\n\nThe man entered, or rather, glided into, an open glade, at a\nconsiderable distance, masked by large trees, but with which\nBoulatruelle was perfectly familiar, on account of having noticed, near\na large pile of porous stones, an ailing chestnut-tree bandaged with\na sheet of zinc nailed directly upon the bark. This glade was the one\nwhich was formerly called the Blaru-bottom. The heap of stones, destined\nfor no one knows what employment, which was visible there thirty years\nago, is doubtless still there. Nothing equals a heap of stones in\nlongevity, unless it is a board fence. They are temporary expedients.\nWhat a reason for lasting!\n\nBoulatruelle, with the rapidity of joy, dropped rather than descended\nfrom the tree. The lair was unearthed, the question now was to seize the\nbeast. That famous treasure of his dreams was probably there.\n\nIt was no small matter to reach that glade. By the beaten paths, which\nindulge in a thousand teasing zigzags, it required a good quarter of an\nhour. In a bee-line, through the underbrush, which is peculiarly dense,\nvery thorny, and very aggressive in that locality, a full half hour was\nnecessary. Boulatruelle committed the error of not comprehending this.\nHe believed in the straight line; a respectable optical illusion which\nruins many a man. The thicket, bristling as it was, struck him as the\nbest road.\n\n\"Let's take to the wolves' Rue de Rivoli,\" said he.\n\nBoulatruelle, accustomed to taking crooked courses, was on this occasion\nguilty of the fault of going straight.\n\nHe flung himself resolutely into the tangle of undergrowth.\n\nHe had to deal with holly bushes, nettles, hawthorns, eglantines,\nthistles, and very irascible brambles. He was much lacerated.\n\nAt the bottom of the ravine he found water which he was obliged to\ntraverse.\n\nAt last he reached the Blaru-bottom, after the lapse of forty minutes,\nsweating, soaked, breathless, scratched, and ferocious.\n\nThere was no one in the glade. Boulatruelle rushed to the heap of\nstones. It was in its place. It had not been carried off.\n\nAs for the man, he had vanished in the forest. He had made his escape.\nWhere? in what direction? into what thicket? Impossible to guess.\n\nAnd, heartrending to say, there, behind the pile of stones, in front of\nthe tree with the sheet of zinc, was freshly turned earth, a pick-axe,\nabandoned or forgotten, and a hole.\n\nThe hole was empty.\n\n\"Thief!\" shrieked Boulatruelle, shaking his fist at the horizon.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II--MARIUS, EMERGING FROM CIVIL WAR, MAKES READY FOR DOMESTIC\nWAR\n\nFor a long time, Marius was neither dead nor alive. For many weeks he\nlay in a fever accompanied by delirium, and by tolerably grave cerebral\nsymptoms, caused more by the shocks of the wounds on the head than by\nthe wounds themselves.\n\nHe repeated Cosette's name for whole nights in the melancholy loquacity\nof fever, and with the sombre obstinacy of agony. The extent of some of\nthe lesions presented a serious danger, the suppuration of large wounds\nbeing always liable to become re-absorbed, and consequently, to kill\nthe sick man, under certain atmospheric conditions; at every change of\nweather, at the slightest storm, the physician was uneasy.\n\n\"Above all things,\" he repeated, \"let the wounded man be subjected to no\nemotion.\" The dressing of the wounds was complicated and difficult,\nthe fixation of apparatus and bandages by cerecloths not having been\ninvented as yet, at that epoch. Nicolette used up a sheet \"as big as the\nceiling,\" as she put it, for lint. It was not without difficulty\nthat the chloruretted lotions and the nitrate of silver overcame the\ngangrene. As long as there was any danger, M. Gillenormand, seated in\ndespair at his grandson's pillow, was, like Marius, neither alive nor\ndead.\n\nEvery day, sometimes twice a day, a very well dressed gentleman with\nwhite hair,--such was the description given by the porter,--came to\ninquire about the wounded man, and left a large package of lint for the\ndressings.\n\nFinally, on the 7th of September, four months to a day, after the\nsorrowful night when he had been brought back to his grandfather in a\ndying condition, the doctor declared that he would answer for Marius.\nConvalescence began. But Marius was forced to remain for two months more\nstretched out on a long chair, on account of the results called up by\nthe fracture of his collar-bone. There always is a last wound like that\nwhich will not close, and which prolongs the dressings indefinitely, to\nthe great annoyance of the sick person.\n\nHowever, this long illness and this long convalescence saved him\nfrom all pursuit. In France, there is no wrath, not even of a public\ncharacter, which six months will not extinguish. Revolts, in the present\nstate of society, are so much the fault of every one, that they are\nfollowed by a certain necessity of shutting the eyes.\n\nLet us add, that the inexcusable Gisquet order, which enjoined doctors\nto lodge information against the wounded, having outraged public\nopinion, and not opinion alone, but the King first of all, the wounded\nwere covered and protected by this indignation; and, with the exception\nof those who had been made prisoners in the very act of combat, the\ncouncils of war did not dare to trouble any one. So Marius was left in\npeace.\n\nM. Gillenormand first passed through all manner of anguish, and then\nthrough every form of ecstasy. It was found difficult to prevent his\npassing every night beside the wounded man; he had his big arm-chair\ncarried to Marius' bedside; he required his daughter to take the\nfinest linen in the house for compresses and bandages. Mademoiselle\nGillenormand, like a sage and elderly person, contrived to spare the\nfine linen, while allowing the grandfather to think that he was obeyed.\nM. Gillenormand would not permit any one to explain to him, that for the\npreparation of lint batiste is not nearly so good as coarse linen,\nnor new linen as old linen. He was present at all the dressings of the\nwounds from which Mademoiselle Gillenormand modestly absented herself.\nWhen the dead flesh was cut away with scissors, he said: \"Aie! aie!\"\nNothing was more touching than to see him with his gentle, senile palsy,\noffer the wounded man a cup of his cooling-draught. He overwhelmed the\ndoctor with questions. He did not observe that he asked the same ones\nover and over again.\n\nOn the day when the doctor announced to him that Marius was out of\ndanger, the good man was in a delirium. He made his porter a present of\nthree louis. That evening, on his return to his own chamber, he danced\na gavotte, using his thumb and forefinger as castanets, and he sang the\nfollowing song:\n\n      \"Jeanne est nee a Fougere     \"Amour, tu vis en elle;\n       Vrai nid d'une bergere;       Car c'est dans sa prunelle\n       J'adore son jupon,            Que tu mets ton carquois.\n           Fripon.                       Narquois!\n\n                \"Moi, je la chante, et j'aime,\n                 Plus que Diane meme,\n                 Jeanne et ses durs tetons\n                     Bretons.\"[61]\n\n\n\"Love, thou dwellest in her; For 'tis in her eyes that thou placest thy\nquiver, sly scamp!\n\n\"As for me, I sing her, and I love, more than Diana herself, Jeanne and\nher firm Breton breasts.\"\n\n\nThen he knelt upon a chair, and Basque, who was watching him through the\nhalf-open door, made sure that he was praying.\n\nUp to that time, he had not believed in God.\n\nAt each succeeding phase of improvement, which became more and more\npronounced, the grandfather raved. He executed a multitude of mechanical\nactions full of joy; he ascended and descended the stairs, without\nknowing why. A pretty female neighbor was amazed one morning at\nreceiving a big bouquet; it was M. Gillenormand who had sent it to\nher. The husband made a jealous scene. M. Gillenormand tried to draw\nNicolette upon his knees. He called Marius, \"M. le Baron.\" He shouted:\n\"Long live the Republic!\"\n\nEvery moment, he kept asking the doctor: \"Is he no longer in danger?\"\nHe gazed upon Marius with the eyes of a grandmother. He brooded over him\nwhile he ate. He no longer knew himself, he no longer rendered himself\nan account of himself. Marius was the master of the house, there was\nabdication in his joy, he was the grandson of his grandson.\n\nIn the state of joy in which he then was, he was the most venerable of\nchildren. In his fear lest he might fatigue or annoy the convalescent,\nhe stepped behind him to smile. He was content, joyous, delighted,\ncharming, young. His white locks added a gentle majesty to the gay\nradiance of his visage. When grace is mingled with wrinkles, it is\nadorable. There is an indescribable aurora in beaming old age.\n\nAs for Marius, as he allowed them to dress his wounds and care for him,\nhe had but one fixed idea: Cosette.\n\nAfter the fever and delirium had left him, he did not again pronounce\nher name, and it might have been supposed that he no longer thought of\nher. He held his peace, precisely because his soul was there.\n\nHe did not know what had become of Cosette; the whole affair of the\nRue de la Chanvrerie was like a cloud in his memory; shadows that were\nalmost indistinct, floated through his mind, Eponine, Gavroche, Mabeuf,\nthe Thenardiers, all his friends gloomily intermingled with the smoke\nof the barricade; the strange passage of M. Fauchelevent through that\nadventure produced on him the effect of a puzzle in a tempest; he\nunderstood nothing connected with his own life, he did not know how nor\nby whom he had been saved, and no one of those around him knew this; all\nthat they had been able to tell him was, that he had been brought home\nat night in a hackney-coach, to the Rue des Filles-du-Calvaire; past,\npresent, future were nothing more to him than the mist of a vague idea;\nbut in that fog there was one immovable point, one clear and precise\noutline, something made of granite, a resolution, a will; to find\nCosette once more. For him, the idea of life was not distinct from the\nidea of Cosette. He had decreed in his heart that he would not accept\nthe one without the other, and he was immovably resolved to exact of\nany person whatever, who should desire to force him to live,--from his\ngrandfather, from fate, from hell,--the restitution of his vanished\nEden.\n\nHe did not conceal from himself the fact that obstacles existed.\n\nLet us here emphasize one detail, he was not won over and was but little\nsoftened by all the solicitude and tenderness of his grandfather. In\nthe first place, he was not in the secret; then, in his reveries of\nan invalid, which were still feverish, possibly, he distrusted this\ntenderness as a strange and novel thing, which had for its object his\nconquest. He remained cold. The grandfather absolutely wasted his poor\nold smile. Marius said to himself that it was all right so long as he,\nMarius, did not speak, and let things take their course; but that when\nit became a question of Cosette, he would find another face, and that\nhis grandfather's true attitude would be unmasked. Then there would\nbe an unpleasant scene; a recrudescence of family questions, a\nconfrontation of positions, every sort of sarcasm and all manner of\nobjections at one and the same time, Fauchelevent, Coupelevent, fortune,\npoverty, a stone about his neck, the future. Violent resistance;\nconclusion: a refusal. Marius stiffened himself in advance.\n\nAnd then, in proportion as he regained life, the old ulcers of his\nmemory opened once more, he reflected again on the past, Colonel\nPontmercy placed himself once more between M. Gillenormand and him,\nMarius, he told himself that he had no true kindness to expect from\na person who had been so unjust and so hard to his father. And\nwith health, there returned to him a sort of harshness towards his\ngrandfather. The old man was gently pained by this. M. Gillenormand,\nwithout however allowing it to appear, observed that Marius, ever since\nthe latter had been brought back to him and had regained consciousness,\nhad not once called him father. It is true that he did not say\n\"monsieur\" to him; but he contrived not to say either the one or the\nother, by means of a certain way of turning his phrases. Obviously, a\ncrisis was approaching.\n\nAs almost always happens in such cases, Marius skirmished before giving\nbattle, by way of proving himself. This is called \"feeling the ground.\"\nOne morning it came to pass that M. Gillenormand spoke slightingly of\nthe Convention, apropos of a newspaper which had fallen into his\nhands, and gave vent to a Royalist harangue on Danton, Saint-Juste and\nRobespierre.--\"The men of '93 were giants,\" said Marius with severity.\nThe old man held his peace, and uttered not a sound during the remainder\nof that day.\n\nMarius, who had always present to his mind the inflexible grandfather of\nhis early years, interpreted this silence as a profound concentration\nof wrath, augured from it a hot conflict, and augmented his preparations\nfor the fray in the inmost recesses of his mind.\n\nHe decided that, in case of a refusal, he would tear off his bandages,\ndislocate his collar-bone, that he would lay bare all the wounds which\nhe had left, and would reject all food. His wounds were his munitions of\nwar. He would have Cosette or die.\n\nHe awaited the propitious moment with the crafty patience of the sick.\n\nThat moment arrived.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III--MARIUS ATTACKED\n\nOne day, M. Gillenormand, while his daughter was putting in order the\nphials and cups on the marble of the commode, bent over Marius and said\nto him in his tenderest accents: \"Look here, my little Marius, if I were\nin your place, I would eat meat now in preference to fish. A fried sole\nis excellent to begin a convalescence with, but a good cutlet is needed\nto put a sick man on his feet.\"\n\nMarius, who had almost entirely recovered his strength, collected\nthe whole of it, drew himself up into a sitting posture, laid his two\nclenched fists on the sheets of his bed, looked his grandfather in the\nface, assumed a terrible air, and said:\n\n\"This leads me to say something to you.\"\n\n\"What is it?\"\n\n\"That I wish to marry.\"\n\n\"Agreed,\" said his grandfather.--And he burst out laughing.\n\n\"How agreed?\"\n\n\"Yes, agreed. You shall have your little girl.\"\n\nMarius, stunned and overwhelmed with the dazzling shock, trembled in\nevery limb.\n\nM. Gillenormand went on:\n\n\"Yes, you shall have her, that pretty little girl of yours. She comes\nevery day in the shape of an old gentleman to inquire after you. Ever\nsince you were wounded, she has passed her time in weeping and making\nlint. I have made inquiries. She lives in the Rue de l'Homme Arme, No.\n7. Ah! There we have it! Ah! so you want her! Well, you shall have\nher. You're caught. You had arranged your little plot, you had said to\nyourself:--'I'm going to signify this squarely to my grandfather, to\nthat mummy of the Regency and of the Directory, to that ancient beau,\nto that Dorante turned Geronte; he has indulged in his frivolities also,\nthat he has, and he has had his love affairs, and his grisettes and his\nCosettes; he has made his rustle, he has had his wings, he has eaten of\nthe bread of spring; he certainly must remember it.' Ah! you take the\ncockchafer by the horns. That's good. I offer you a cutlet and you\nanswer me: 'By the way, I want to marry.' There's a transition for\nyou! Ah! you reckoned on a bickering! You do not know that I am an old\ncoward. What do you say to that? You are vexed? You did not expect to\nfind your grandfather still more foolish than yourself, you are wasting\nthe discourse which you meant to bestow upon me, Mr. Lawyer, and that's\nvexatious. Well, so much the worse, rage away. I'll do whatever\nyou wish, and that cuts you short, imbecile! Listen. I have made my\ninquiries, I'm cunning too; she is charming, she is discreet, it is not\ntrue about the lancer, she has made heaps of lint, she's a jewel, she\nadores you, if you had died, there would have been three of us, her\ncoffin would have accompanied mine. I have had an idea, ever since you\nhave been better, of simply planting her at your bedside, but it is only\nin romances that young girls are brought to the bedsides of handsome\nyoung wounded men who interest them. It is not done. What would your\naunt have said to it? You were nude three quarters of the time, my good\nfellow. Ask Nicolette, who has not left you for a moment, if there was\nany possibility of having a woman here. And then, what would the doctor\nhave said? A pretty girl does not cure a man of fever. In short, it's\nall right, let us say no more about it, all's said, all's done, it's all\nsettled, take her. Such is my ferocity. You see, I perceived that you\ndid not love me. I said to myself: 'Here now, I have my little Cosette\nright under my hand, I'm going to give her to him, he will be obliged\nto love me a little then, or he must tell the reason why.' Ah! so you\nthought that the old man was going to storm, to put on a big voice,\nto shout no, and to lift his cane at all that aurora. Not a bit of it.\nCosette, so be it; love, so be it; I ask nothing better. Pray take the\ntrouble of getting married, sir. Be happy, my well-beloved child.\"\n\nThat said, the old man burst forth into sobs.\n\nAnd he seized Marius' head, and pressed it with both arms against his\nbreast, and both fell to weeping. This is one of the forms of supreme\nhappiness.\n\n\"Father!\" cried Marius.\n\n\"Ah, so you love me!\" said the old man.\n\nAn ineffable moment ensued. They were choking and could not speak.\n\nAt length the old man stammered:\n\n\"Come! his mouth is unstopped at last. He has said: 'Father' to me.\"\n\nMarius disengaged his head from his grandfather's arms, and said gently:\n\n\"But, father, now that I am quite well, it seems to me that I might see\nher.\"\n\n\"Agreed again, you shall see her to-morrow.\"\n\n\"Father!\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"Why not to-day?\"\n\n\"Well, to-day then. Let it be to-day. You have called me 'father' three\ntimes, and it is worth it. I will attend to it. She shall be brought\nhither. Agreed, I tell you. It has already been put into verse. This is\nthe ending of the elegy of the 'Jeune Malade' by Andre Chenier, by Andre\nChenier whose throat was cut by the ras . . . by the giants of '93.\"\n\nM. Gillenormand fancied that he detected a faint frown on the part of\nMarius, who, in truth, as we must admit, was no longer listening to him,\nand who was thinking far more of Cosette than of 1793.\n\nThe grandfather, trembling at having so inopportunely introduced Andre\nChenier, resumed precipitately:\n\n\"Cut his throat is not the word. The fact is that the great\nrevolutionary geniuses, who were not malicious, that is incontestable,\nwho were heroes, pardi! found that Andre Chenier embarrassed them\nsomewhat, and they had him guillot . . . that is to say, those great\nmen on the 7th of Thermidor, besought Andre Chenier, in the interests of\npublic safety, to be so good as to go . . .\"\n\nM. Gillenormand, clutched by the throat by his own phrase, could not\nproceed. Being able neither to finish it nor to retract it, while his\ndaughter arranged the pillow behind Marius, who was overwhelmed with so\nmany emotions, the old man rushed headlong, with as much rapidity as\nhis age permitted, from the bed-chamber, shut the door behind him, and,\npurple, choking and foaming at the mouth, his eyes starting from his\nhead, he found himself nose to nose with honest Basque, who was blacking\nboots in the anteroom. He seized Basque by the collar, and shouted full\nin his face in fury:--\"By the hundred thousand Javottes of the devil,\nthose ruffians did assassinate him!\"\n\n\"Who, sir?\"\n\n\"Andre Chenier!\"\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" said Basque in alarm.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV--MADEMOISELLE GILLENORMAND ENDS BY NO LONGER THINKING IT A\nBAD THING THAT M. FAUCHELEVENT SHOULD HAVE ENTERED WITH SOMETHING UNDER\nHIS ARM\n\nCosette and Marius beheld each other once more.\n\nWhat that interview was like we decline to say. There are things which\none must not attempt to depict; the sun is one of them.\n\nThe entire family, including Basque and Nicolette, were assembled in\nMarius' chamber at the moment when Cosette entered it.\n\nPrecisely at that moment, the grandfather was on the point of blowing\nhis nose; he stopped short, holding his nose in his handkerchief, and\ngazing over it at Cosette.\n\nShe appeared on the threshold; it seemed to him that she was surrounded\nby a glory.\n\n\"Adorable!\" he exclaimed.\n\nThen he blew his nose noisily.\n\nCosette was intoxicated, delighted, frightened, in heaven. She was as\nthoroughly alarmed as any one can be by happiness. She stammered all\npale, yet flushed, she wanted to fling herself into Marius' arms, and\ndared not. Ashamed of loving in the presence of all these people. People\nare pitiless towards happy lovers; they remain when the latter most\ndesire to be left alone. Lovers have no need of any people whatever.\n\nWith Cosette, and behind her, there had entered a man with white hair\nwho was grave yet smiling, though with a vague and heartrending smile.\nIt was \"Monsieur Fauchelevent\"; it was Jean Valjean.\n\nHe was very well dressed, as the porter had said, entirely in black, in\nperfectly new garments, and with a white cravat.\n\nThe porter was a thousand leagues from recognizing in this correct\nbourgeois, in this probable notary, the fear-inspiring bearer of the\ncorpse, who had sprung up at his door on the night of the 7th of June,\ntattered, muddy, hideous, haggard, his face masked in blood and mire,\nsupporting in his arms the fainting Marius; still, his porter's scent\nwas aroused. When M. Fauchelevent arrived with Cosette, the porter had\nnot been able to refrain from communicating to his wife this aside: \"I\ndon't know why it is, but I can't help fancying that I've seen that face\nbefore.\"\n\nM. Fauchelevent in Marius' chamber, remained apart near the door. He\nhad under his arm, a package which bore considerable resemblance to an\noctavo volume enveloped in paper. The enveloping paper was of a greenish\nhue, and appeared to be mouldy.\n\n\"Does the gentleman always have books like that under his arm?\"\nMademoiselle Gillenormand, who did not like books, demanded in a low\ntone of Nicolette.\n\n\"Well,\" retorted M. Gillenormand, who had overheard her, in the same\ntone, \"he's a learned man. What then? Is that his fault? Monsieur\nBoulard, one of my acquaintances, never walked out without a book under\nhis arm either, and he always had some old volume hugged to his heart\nlike that.\"\n\nAnd, with a bow, he said aloud:\n\n\"Monsieur Tranchelevent . . .\"\n\nFather Gillenormand did not do it intentionally, but inattention to\nproper names was an aristocratic habit of his.\n\n\"Monsieur Tranchelevent, I have the honor of asking you, on behalf of my\ngrandson, Baron Marius Pontmercy, for the hand of Mademoiselle.\"\n\nMonsieur Tranchelevent bowed.\n\n\"That's settled,\" said the grandfather.\n\nAnd, turning to Marius and Cosette, with both arms extended in blessing,\nhe cried:\n\n\"Permission to adore each other!\"\n\nThey did not require him to repeat it twice. So much the worse! the\nchirping began. They talked low. Marius, resting on his elbow on his\nreclining chair, Cosette standing beside him. \"Oh, heavens!\" murmured\nCosette, \"I see you once again! it is thou! it is you! The idea of going\nand fighting like that! But why? It is horrible. I have been dead for\nfour months. Oh! how wicked it was of you to go to that battle! What had\nI done to you? I pardon you, but you will never do it again. A little\nwhile ago, when they came to tell us to come to you, I still thought\nthat I was about to die, but it was from joy. I was so sad! I have not\ntaken the time to dress myself, I must frighten people with my looks!\nWhat will your relatives say to see me in a crumpled collar? Do speak!\nYou let me do all the talking. We are still in the Rue de l'Homme Arme.\nIt seems that your shoulder was terrible. They told me that you could\nput your fist in it. And then, it seems that they cut your flesh with\nthe scissors. That is frightful. I have cried till I have no eyes left.\nIt is queer that a person can suffer like that. Your grandfather has a\nvery kindly air. Don't disturb yourself, don't rise on your elbow, you\nwill injure yourself. Oh! how happy I am! So our unhappiness is over!\nI am quite foolish. I had things to say to you, and I no longer know in\nthe least what they were. Do you still love me? We live in the Rue de\nl'Homme Arme. There is no garden. I made lint all the time; stay, sir,\nlook, it is your fault, I have a callous on my fingers.\"\n\n\"Angel!\" said Marius.\n\nAngel is the only word in the language which cannot be worn out. No\nother word could resist the merciless use which lovers make of it.\n\nThen as there were spectators, they paused and said not a word more,\ncontenting themselves with softly touching each other's hands.\n\nM. Gillenormand turned towards those who were in the room and cried:\n\n\"Talk loud, the rest of you. Make a noise, you people behind the scenes.\nCome, a little uproar, the deuce! so that the children can chatter at\ntheir ease.\"\n\nAnd, approaching Marius and Cosette, he said to them in a very low\nvoice:\n\n\"Call each other thou. Don't stand on ceremony.\"\n\nAunt Gillenormand looked on in amazement at this irruption of light\nin her elderly household. There was nothing aggressive about this\namazement; it was not the least in the world like the scandalized and\nenvious glance of an owl at two turtle-doves, it was the stupid eye of a\npoor innocent seven and fifty years of age; it was a life which had been\na failure gazing at that triumph, love.\n\n\"Mademoiselle Gillenormand senior,\" said her father to her, \"I told you\nthat this is what would happen to you.\"\n\nHe remained silent for a moment, and then added:\n\n\"Look at the happiness of others.\"\n\nThen he turned to Cosette.\n\n\"How pretty she is! how pretty she is! She's a Greuze. So you are going\nto have that all to yourself, you scamp! Ah! my rogue, you are getting\noff nicely with me, you are happy; if I were not fifteen years too old,\nwe would fight with swords to see which of us should have her. Come now!\nI am in love with you, mademoiselle. It's perfectly simple. It is your\nright. You are in the right. Ah! what a sweet, charming little wedding\nthis will make! Our parish is Saint-Denis du Saint Sacrament, but I will\nget a dispensation so that you can be married at Saint-Paul. The church\nis better. It was built by the Jesuits. It is more coquettish. It is\nopposite the fountain of Cardinal de Birague. The masterpiece of Jesuit\narchitecture is at Namur. It is called Saint-Loup. You must go there\nafter you are married. It is worth the journey. Mademoiselle, I am quite\nof your mind, I think girls ought to marry; that is what they are made\nfor. There is a certain Sainte-Catherine whom I should always like to\nsee uncoiffed.[62] It's a fine thing to remain a spinster, but it is\nchilly. The Bible says: Multiply. In order to save the people, Jeanne\nd'Arc is needed; but in order to make people, what is needed is Mother\nGoose. So, marry, my beauties. I really do not see the use in remaining\na spinster! I know that they have their chapel apart in the church,\nand that they fall back on the Society of the Virgin; but, sapristi, a\nhandsome husband, a fine fellow, and at the expiration of a year, a\nbig, blond brat who nurses lustily, and who has fine rolls of fat on his\nthighs, and who musses up your breast in handfuls with his little rosy\npaws, laughing the while like the dawn,--that's better than holding a\ncandle at vespers, and chanting Turris eburnea!\"\n\nThe grandfather executed a pirouette on his eighty-year-old heels, and\nbegan to talk again like a spring that has broken loose once more:\n\n           \"Ainsi, bornant les cours de tes revasseries,\n            Alcippe, il est donc vrai, dans peu tu te maries.\"[63]\n\n\n\"By the way!\"\n\n\"What is it, father?\"\n\n\"Have not you an intimate friend?\"\n\n\"Yes, Courfeyrac.\"\n\n\"What has become of him?\"\n\n\"He is dead.\"\n\n\"That is good.\"\n\nHe seated himself near them, made Cosette sit down, and took their four\nhands in his aged and wrinkled hands:\n\n\"She is exquisite, this darling. She's a masterpiece, this Cosette!\nShe is a very little girl and a very great lady. She will only be a\nBaroness, which is a come down for her; she was born a Marquise. What\neyelashes she has! Get it well fixed in your noddles, my children, that\nyou are in the true road. Love each other. Be foolish about it. Love is\nthe folly of men and the wit of God. Adore each other. Only,\" he added,\nsuddenly becoming gloomy, \"what a misfortune! It has just occurred to\nme! More than half of what I possess is swallowed up in an annuity; so\nlong as I live, it will not matter, but after my death, a score of years\nhence, ah! my poor children, you will not have a sou! Your beautiful\nwhite hands, Madame la Baronne, will do the devil the honor of pulling\nhim by the tail.\"[64]\n\nAt this point they heard a grave and tranquil voice say:\n\n\"Mademoiselle Euphrasie Fauchelevent possesses six hundred thousand\nfrancs.\"\n\nIt was the voice of Jean Valjean.\n\nSo far he had not uttered a single word, no one seemed to be aware that\nhe was there, and he had remained standing erect and motionless, behind\nall these happy people.\n\n\"What has Mademoiselle Euphrasie to do with the question?\" inquired the\nstartled grandfather.\n\n\"I am she,\" replied Cosette.\n\n\"Six hundred thousand francs?\" resumed M. Gillenormand.\n\n\"Minus fourteen or fifteen thousand francs, possibly,\" said Jean\nValjean.\n\nAnd he laid on the table the package which Mademoiselle Gillenormand had\nmistaken for a book.\n\nJean Valjean himself opened the package; it was a bundle of bank-notes.\nThey were turned over and counted. There were five hundred notes for a\nthousand francs each, and one hundred and sixty-eight of five hundred.\nIn all, five hundred and eighty-four thousand francs.\n\n\"This is a fine book,\" said M. Gillenormand.\n\n\"Five hundred and eighty-four thousand francs!\" murmured the aunt.\n\n\"This arranges things well, does it not, Mademoiselle Gillenormand\nsenior?\" said the grandfather. \"That devil of a Marius has ferreted out\nthe nest of a millionaire grisette in his tree of dreams! Just trust\nto the love affairs of young folks now, will you! Students find\nstudentesses with six hundred thousand francs. Cherubino works better\nthan Rothschild.\"\n\n\"Five hundred and eighty-four thousand francs!\" repeated Mademoiselle\nGillenormand, in a low tone. \"Five hundred and eighty-four! one might as\nwell say six hundred thousand!\"\n\nAs for Marius and Cosette, they were gazing at each other while this was\ngoing on; they hardly heeded this detail.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V--DEPOSIT YOUR MONEY IN A FOREST RATHER THAN WITH A NOTARY\n\nThe reader has, no doubt, understood, without necessitating a lengthy\nexplanation, that Jean Valjean, after the Champmathieu affair, had been\nable, thanks to his first escape of a few days' duration, to come to\nParis and to withdraw in season, from the hands of Laffitte, the\nsum earned by him, under the name of Monsieur Madeleine, at\nMontreuil-sur-Mer; and that fearing that he might be recaptured,--which\neventually happened--he had buried and hidden that sum in the forest\nof Montfermeil, in the locality known as the Blaru-bottom. The sum,\nsix hundred and thirty thousand francs, all in bank-bills, was not very\nbulky, and was contained in a box; only, in order to preserve the\nbox from dampness, he had placed it in a coffer filled with chestnut\nshavings. In the same coffer he had placed his other treasures, the\nBishop's candlesticks. It will be remembered that he had carried off\nthe candlesticks when he made his escape from Montreuil-sur-Mer. The man\nseen one evening for the first time by Boulatruelle, was Jean Valjean.\nLater on, every time that Jean Valjean needed money, he went to get it\nin the Blaru-bottom. Hence the absences which we have mentioned. He had\na pickaxe somewhere in the heather, in a hiding-place known to himself\nalone. When he beheld Marius convalescent, feeling that the hour was at\nhand, when that money might prove of service, he had gone to get it;\nit was he again, whom Boulatruelle had seen in the woods, but on\nthis occasion, in the morning instead of in the evening. Boulatreulle\ninherited his pickaxe.\n\nThe actual sum was five hundred and eighty-four thousand, five hundred\nfrancs. Jean Valjean withdrew the five hundred francs for himself.--\"We\nshall see hereafter,\" he thought.\n\nThe difference between that sum and the six hundred and thirty thousand\nfrancs withdrawn from Laffitte represented his expenditure in ten years,\nfrom 1823 to 1833. The five years of his stay in the convent had cost\nonly five thousand francs.\n\nJean Valjean set the two candlesticks on the chimney-piece, where they\nglittered to the great admiration of Toussaint.\n\nMoreover, Jean Valjean knew that he was delivered from Javert. The\nstory had been told in his presence, and he had verified the fact in\nthe Moniteur, how a police inspector named Javert had been found drowned\nunder a boat belonging to some laundresses, between the Pont au Change\nand the Pont-Neuf, and that a writing left by this man, otherwise\nirreproachable and highly esteemed by his superiors, pointed to a fit\nof mental aberration and a suicide.--\"In fact,\" thought Jean Valjean,\n\"since he left me at liberty, once having got me in his power, he must\nhave been already mad.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI--THE TWO OLD MEN DO EVERYTHING, EACH ONE AFTER HIS OWN\nFASHION, TO RENDER COSETTE HAPPY\n\nEverything was made ready for the wedding. The doctor, on being\nconsulted, declared that it might take place in February. It was then\nDecember. A few ravishing weeks of perfect happiness passed.\n\nThe grandfather was not the least happy of them all. He remained for a\nquarter of an hour at a time gazing at Cosette.\n\n\"The wonderful, beautiful girl!\" he exclaimed. \"And she has so sweet and\ngood an air! she is, without exception, the most charming girl that I\nhave ever seen in my life. Later on, she'll have virtues with an odor of\nviolets. How graceful! one cannot live otherwise than nobly with such\na creature. Marius, my boy, you are a Baron, you are rich, don't go to\npettifogging, I beg of you.\"\n\nCosette and Marius had passed abruptly from the sepulchre to paradise.\nThe transition had not been softened, and they would have been stunned,\nhad they not been dazzled by it.\n\n\"Do you understand anything about it?\" said Marius to Cosette.\n\n\"No,\" replied Cosette, \"but it seems to me that the good God is caring\nfor us.\"\n\nJean Valjean did everything, smoothed away every difficulty, arranged\neverything, made everything easy. He hastened towards Cosette's\nhappiness with as much ardor, and, apparently with as much joy, as\nCosette herself.\n\nAs he had been a mayor, he understood how to solve that delicate\nproblem, with the secret of which he alone was acquainted, Cosette's\ncivil status. If he were to announce her origin bluntly, it might\nprevent the marriage, who knows? He extricated Cosette from all\ndifficulties. He concocted for her a family of dead people, a sure means\nof not encountering any objections. Cosette was the only scion of an\nextinct family; Cosette was not his own daughter, but the daughter of\nthe other Fauchelevent. Two brothers Fauchelevent had been gardeners to\nthe convent of the Petit-Picpus. Inquiry was made at that convent; the\nvery best information and the most respectable references abounded; the\ngood nuns, not very apt and but little inclined to fathom questions of\npaternity, and not attaching any importance to the matter, had never\nunderstood exactly of which of the two Fauchelevents Cosette was the\ndaughter. They said what was wanted and they said it with zeal. An\nacte de notoriete was drawn up. Cosette became in the eyes of the law,\nMademoiselle Euphrasie Fauchelevent. She was declared an orphan, both\nfather and mother being dead. Jean Valjean so arranged it that he was\nappointed, under the name of Fauchelevent, as Cosette's guardian, with\nM. Gillenormand as supervising guardian over him.\n\nAs for the five hundred and eighty thousand francs, they constituted\na legacy bequeathed to Cosette by a dead person, who desired to\nremain unknown. The original legacy had consisted of five hundred and\nninety-four thousand francs; but ten thousand francs had been expended\non the education of Mademoiselle Euphrasie, five thousand francs of that\namount having been paid to the convent. This legacy, deposited in\nthe hands of a third party, was to be turned over to Cosette at her\nmajority, or at the date of her marriage. This, taken as a whole, was\nvery acceptable, as the reader will perceive, especially when the sum\ndue was half a million. There were some peculiarities here and there,\nit is true, but they were not noticed; one of the interested parties\nhad his eyes blindfolded by love, the others by the six hundred thousand\nfrancs.\n\nCosette learned that she was not the daughter of that old man whom she\nhad so long called father. He was merely a kinsman; another Fauchelevent\nwas her real father. At any other time this would have broken her heart.\nBut at the ineffable moment which she was then passing through, it cast\nbut a slight shadow, a faint cloud, and she was so full of joy that the\ncloud did not last long. She had Marius. The young man arrived, the old\nman was effaced; such is life.\n\nAnd then, Cosette had, for long years, been habituated to seeing enigmas\naround her; every being who has had a mysterious childhood is always\nprepared for certain renunciations.\n\nNevertheless, she continued to call Jean Valjean: Father.\n\nCosette, happy as the angels, was enthusiastic over Father Gillenormand.\nIt is true that he overwhelmed her with gallant compliments and\npresents. While Jean Valjean was building up for Cosette a normal\nsituation in society and an unassailable status, M. Gillenormand was\nsuperintending the basket of wedding gifts. Nothing so amused him as\nbeing magnificent. He had given to Cosette a robe of Binche guipure\nwhich had descended to him from his own grandmother.\n\n\"These fashions come up again,\" said he, \"ancient things are the\nrage, and the young women of my old age dress like the old women of my\nchildhood.\"\n\nHe rifled his respectable chests of drawers in Coromandel lacquer, with\nswelling fronts, which had not been opened for years.--\"Let us hear the\nconfession of these dowagers,\" he said, \"let us see what they have in\ntheir paunches.\" He noisily violated the pot-bellied drawers of all\nhis wives, of all his mistresses and of all his grandmothers. Pekins,\ndamasks, lampas, painted moires, robes of shot gros de Tours, India\nkerchiefs embroidered in gold that could be washed, dauphines without a\nright or wrong side, in the piece, Genoa and Alencon point lace,\nparures in antique goldsmith's work, ivory bon-bon boxes ornamented\nwith microscopic battles, gewgaws and ribbons--he lavished everything on\nCosette. Cosette, amazed, desperately in love with Marius, and wild with\ngratitude towards M. Gillenormand, dreamed of a happiness without limit\nclothed in satin and velvet. Her wedding basket seemed to her to be\nupheld by seraphim. Her soul flew out into the azure depths, with wings\nof Mechlin lace.\n\nThe intoxication of the lovers was only equalled, as we have already\nsaid, by the ecstasy of the grandfather. A sort of flourish of trumpets\nwent on in the Rue des Filles-du-Calvaire.\n\nEvery morning, a fresh offering of bric-a-brac from the grandfather to\nCosette. All possible knickknacks glittered around her.\n\nOne day Marius, who was fond of talking gravely in the midst of his\nbliss, said, apropos of I know not what incident:\n\n\"The men of the revolution are so great, that they have the prestige of\nthe ages, like Cato and like Phocion, and each one of them seems to me\nan antique memory.\"\n\n\"Moire antique!\" exclaimed the old gentleman. \"Thanks, Marius. That is\nprecisely the idea of which I was in search.\"\n\nAnd on the following day, a magnificent dress of tea-rose colored moire\nantique was added to Cosette's wedding presents.\n\nFrom these fripperies, the grandfather extracted a bit of wisdom.\n\n\"Love is all very well; but there must be something else to go with\nit. The useless must be mingled with happiness. Happiness is only the\nnecessary. Season that enormously with the superfluous for me. A\npalace and her heart. Her heart and the Louvre. Her heart and the grand\nwaterworks of Versailles. Give me my shepherdess and try to make her a\nduchess. Fetch me Phyllis crowned with corn-flowers, and add a hundred\nthousand francs income. Open for me a bucolic perspective as far as you\ncan see, beneath a marble colonnade. I consent to the bucolic and also\nto the fairy spectacle of marble and gold. Dry happiness resembles dry\nbread. One eats, but one does not dine. I want the superfluous, the\nuseless, the extravagant, excess, that which serves no purpose. I\nremember to have seen, in the Cathedral of Strasburg, a clock, as tall\nas a three-story house which marked the hours, which had the kindness to\nindicate the hour, but which had not the air of being made for that; and\nwhich, after having struck midday, or midnight,--midday, the hour of the\nsun, or midnight, the hour of love,--or any other hour that you like,\ngave you the moon and the stars, the earth and the sea, birds and\nfishes, Phoebus and Phoebe, and a host of things which emerged from a\nniche, and the twelve apostles, and the Emperor Charles the Fifth, and\nEponine, and Sabinus, and a throng of little gilded goodmen, who played\non the trumpet to boot. Without reckoning delicious chimes which it\nsprinkled through the air, on every occasion, without any one's knowing\nwhy. Is a petty bald clock-face which merely tells the hour equal to\nthat? For my part, I am of the opinion of the big clock of Strasburg,\nand I prefer it to the cuckoo clock from the Black Forest.\"\n\nM. Gillenormand talked nonsense in connection with the wedding, and all\nthe fripperies of the eighteenth century passed pell-mell through his\ndithyrambs.\n\n\"You are ignorant of the art of festivals. You do not know how to\norganize a day of enjoyment in this age,\" he exclaimed. \"Your nineteenth\ncentury is weak. It lacks excess. It ignores the rich, it ignores the\nnoble. In everything it is clean-shaven. Your third estate is insipid,\ncolorless, odorless, and shapeless. The dreams of your bourgeois who\nset up, as they express it: a pretty boudoir freshly decorated, violet,\nebony and calico. Make way! Make way! the Sieur Curmudgeon is marrying\nMademoiselle Clutch-penny. Sumptuousness and splendor. A louis d'or has\nbeen stuck to a candle. There's the epoch for you. My demand is that I\nmay flee from it beyond the Sarmatians. Ah! in 1787, I predict that all\nwas lost, from the day when I beheld the Duc de Rohan, Prince de Leon,\nDuc de Chabot, Duc de Montbazon, Marquis de Sonbise, Vicomte de Thouars,\npeer of France, go to Longchamps in a tapecu! That has borne its fruits.\nIn this century, men attend to business, they gamble on 'Change, they\nwin money, they are stingy. People take care of their surfaces and\nvarnish them; every one is dressed as though just out of a band-box,\nwashed, soaped, scraped, shaved, combed, waked, smoothed, rubbed,\nbrushed, cleaned on the outside, irreproachable, polished as a pebble,\ndiscreet, neat, and at the same time, death of my life, in the depths of\ntheir consciences they have dung-heaps and cesspools that are enough to\nmake a cow-herd who blows his nose in his fingers, recoil. I grant to\nthis age the device: 'Dirty Cleanliness.' Don't be vexed, Marius, give\nme permission to speak; I say no evil of the people as you see, I am\nalways harping on your people, but do look favorably on my dealing a bit\nof a slap to the bourgeoisie. I belong to it. He who loves well lashes\nwell. Thereupon, I say plainly, that now-a-days people marry, but that\nthey no longer know how to marry. Ah! it is true, I regret the grace\nof the ancient manners. I regret everything about them, their elegance,\ntheir chivalry, those courteous and delicate ways, that joyous luxury\nwhich every one possessed, music forming part of the wedding, a symphony\nabove stairs, a beating of drums below stairs, the dances, the joyous\nfaces round the table, the fine-spun gallant compliments, the songs, the\nfireworks, the frank laughter, the devil's own row, the huge knots of\nribbon. I regret the bride's garter. The bride's garter is cousin to the\ngirdle of Venus. On what does the war of Troy turn? On Helen's garter,\nparbleu! Why did they fight, why did Diomed the divine break over\nthe head of Meriones that great brazen helmet of ten points? why did\nAchilles and Hector hew each other up with vast blows of their lances?\nBecause Helen allowed Paris to take her garter. With Cosette's garter,\nHomer would construct the Iliad. He would put in his poem, a loquacious\nold fellow, like me, and he would call him Nestor. My friends, in bygone\ndays, in those amiable days of yore, people married wisely; they had a\ngood contract, and then they had a good carouse. As soon as Cujas had\ntaken his departure, Gamacho entered. But, in sooth! the stomach is\nan agreeable beast which demands its due, and which wants to have its\nwedding also. People supped well, and had at table a beautiful neighbor\nwithout a guimpe so that her throat was only moderately concealed. Oh!\nthe large laughing mouths, and how gay we were in those days! youth was\na bouquet; every young man terminated in a branch of lilacs or a tuft\nof roses; whether he was a shepherd or a warrior; and if, by chance,\none was a captain of dragoons, one found means to call oneself Florian.\nPeople thought much of looking well. They embroidered and tinted\nthemselves. A bourgeois had the air of a flower, a Marquis had the air\nof a precious stone. People had no straps to their boots, they had no\nboots. They were spruce, shining, waved, lustrous, fluttering, dainty,\ncoquettish, which did not at all prevent their wearing swords by their\nsides. The humming-bird has beak and claws. That was the day of the\nGalland Indies. One of the sides of that century was delicate, the other\nwas magnificent; and by the green cabbages! people amused themselves.\nTo-day, people are serious. The bourgeois is avaricious, the bourgeoise\nis a prude; your century is unfortunate. People would drive away the\nGraces as being too low in the neck. Alas! beauty is concealed as\nthough it were ugliness. Since the revolution, everything, including the\nballet-dancers, has had its trousers; a mountebank dancer must be grave;\nyour rigadoons are doctrinarian. It is necessary to be majestic. People\nwould be greatly annoyed if they did not carry their chins in their\ncravats. The ideal of an urchin of twenty when he marries, is to\nresemble M. Royer-Collard. And do you know what one arrives at with\nthat majesty? at being petty. Learn this: joy is not only joyous; it is\ngreat. But be in love gayly then, what the deuce! marry, when you marry,\nwith fever and giddiness, and tumult, and the uproar of happiness! Be\ngrave in church, well and good. But, as soon as the mass is finished,\nsarpejou! you must make a dream whirl around the bride. A marriage\nshould be royal and chimerical; it should promenade its ceremony from\nthe cathedral of Rheims to the pagoda of Chanteloup. I have a horror\nof a paltry wedding. Ventregoulette! be in Olympus for that one day,\nat least. Be one of the gods. Ah! people might be sylphs. Games and\nLaughter, argiraspides; they are stupids. My friends, every recently\nmade bridegroom ought to be Prince Aldobrandini. Profit by that unique\nminute in life to soar away to the empyrean with the swans and the\neagles, even if you do have to fall back on the morrow into the\nbourgeoisie of the frogs. Don't economize on the nuptials, do not prune\nthem of their splendors; don't scrimp on the day when you beam. The\nwedding is not the housekeeping. Oh! if I were to carry out my fancy,\nit would be gallant, violins would be heard under the trees. Here is\nmy programme: sky-blue and silver. I would mingle with the festival\nthe rural divinities, I would convoke the Dryads and the Nereids. The\nnuptials of Amphitrite, a rosy cloud, nymphs with well dressed locks\nand entirely naked, an Academician offering quatrains to the goddess, a\nchariot drawn by marine monsters.\n\n     \"Triton trottait devant, et tirait de sa conque\n      Des sons si ravissants qu'il ravissait quiconque!\"[65]\n\n--there's a festive programme, there's a good one, or else I know\nnothing of such matters, deuce take it!\"\n\nWhile the grandfather, in full lyrical effusion, was listening to\nhimself, Cosette and Marius grew intoxicated as they gazed freely at\neach other.\n\nAunt Gillenormand surveyed all this with her imperturbable placidity.\nWithin the last five or six months she had experienced a certain amount\nof emotions. Marius returned, Marius brought back bleeding, Marius\nbrought back from a barricade, Marius dead, then living, Marius\nreconciled, Marius betrothed, Marius wedding a poor girl, Marius wedding\na millionairess. The six hundred thousand francs had been her last\nsurprise. Then, her indifference of a girl taking her first communion\nreturned to her. She went regularly to service, told her beads, read her\neuchology, mumbled Aves in one corner of the house, while I love you\nwas being whispered in the other, and she beheld Marius and Cosette in a\nvague way, like two shadows. The shadow was herself.\n\nThere is a certain state of inert asceticism in which the soul,\nneutralized by torpor, a stranger to that which may be designated as the\nbusiness of living, receives no impressions, either human, or pleasant\nor painful, with the exception of earthquakes and catastrophes. This\ndevotion, as Father Gillenormand said to his daughter, corresponds to\na cold in the head. You smell nothing of life. Neither any bad, nor any\ngood odor.\n\nMoreover, the six hundred thousand francs had settled the elderly\nspinster's indecision. Her father had acquired the habit of taking her\nso little into account, that he had not consulted her in the matter of\nconsent to Marius' marriage. He had acted impetuously, according to his\nwont, having, a despot-turned slave, but a single thought,--to satisfy\nMarius. As for the aunt,--it had not even occurred to him that the aunt\nexisted, and that she could have an opinion of her own, and, sheep as\nshe was, this had vexed her. Somewhat resentful in her inmost soul, but\nimpassive externally, she had said to herself: \"My father has settled\nthe question of the marriage without reference to me; I shall settle the\nquestion of the inheritance without consulting him.\" She was rich, in\nfact, and her father was not. She had reserved her decision on this\npoint. It is probable that, had the match been a poor one, she would\nhave left him poor. \"So much the worse for my nephew! he is wedding a\nbeggar, let him be a beggar himself!\" But Cosette's half-million pleased\nthe aunt, and altered her inward situation so far as this pair of lovers\nwere concerned. One owes some consideration to six hundred thousand\nfrancs, and it was evident that she could not do otherwise than leave\nher fortune to these young people, since they did not need it.\n\nIt was arranged that the couple should live with the grandfather--M.\nGillenormand insisted on resigning to them his chamber, the finest in\nthe house. \"That will make me young again,\" he said. \"It's an old plan\nof mine. I have always entertained the idea of having a wedding in my\nchamber.\"\n\nHe furnished this chamber with a multitude of elegant trifles. He had\nthe ceiling and walls hung with an extraordinary stuff, which he had by\nhim in the piece, and which he believed to have emanated from Utrecht\nwith a buttercup-colored satin ground, covered with velvet auricula\nblossoms.--\"It was with that stuff,\" said he, \"that the bed of the\nDuchesse d'Anville at la Roche-Guyon was draped.\"--On the chimney-piece,\nhe set a little figure in Saxe porcelain, carrying a muff against her\nnude stomach.\n\nM. Gillenormand's library became the lawyer's study, which Marius\nneeded; a study, it will be remembered, being required by the council of\nthe order.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII--THE EFFECTS OF DREAMS MINGLED WITH HAPPINESS\n\nThe lovers saw each other every day. Cosette came with M.\nFauchelevent.--\"This is reversing things,\" said Mademoiselle\nGillenormand, \"to have the bride come to the house to do the courting\nlike this.\" But Marius' convalescence had caused the habit to become\nestablished, and the arm-chairs of the Rue des Filles-du-Calvaire,\nbetter adapted to interviews than the straw chairs of the Rue de l'Homme\nArme, had rooted it. Marius and M. Fauchelevent saw each other, but did\nnot address each other. It seemed as though this had been agreed upon.\nEvery girl needs a chaperon. Cosette could not have come without\nM. Fauchelevent. In Marius' eyes, M. Fauchelevent was the condition\nattached to Cosette. He accepted it. By dint of discussing political\nmatters, vaguely and without precision, from the point of view of the\ngeneral amelioration of the fate of all men, they came to say a little\nmore than \"yes\" and \"no.\" Once, on the subject of education, which\nMarius wished to have free and obligatory, multiplied under all forms\nlavished on every one, like the air and the sun in a word, respirable\nfor the entire population, they were in unison, and they almost\nconversed. M. Fauchelevent talked well, and even with a certain\nloftiness of language--still he lacked something indescribable. M.\nFauchelevent possessed something less and also something more, than a\nman of the world.\n\nMarius, inwardly, and in the depths of his thought, surrounded with\nall sorts of mute questions this M. Fauchelevent, who was to him simply\nbenevolent and cold. There were moments when doubts as to his own\nrecollections occurred to him. There was a void in his memory, a black\nspot, an abyss excavated by four months of agony.--Many things had been\nlost therein. He had come to the point of asking himself whether it were\nreally a fact that he had seen M. Fauchelevent, so serious and so calm a\nman, in the barricade.\n\nThis was not, however, the only stupor which the apparitions and the\ndisappearances of the past had left in his mind. It must not be supposed\nthat he was delivered from all those obsessions of the memory which\nforce us, even when happy, even when satisfied, to glance sadly behind\nus. The head which does not turn backwards towards horizons that have\nvanished contains neither thought nor love. At times, Marius clasped his\nface between his hands, and the vague and tumultuous past traversed the\ntwilight which reigned in his brain. Again he beheld Mabeuf fall, he\nheard Gavroche singing amid the grape-shot, he felt beneath his lips the\ncold brow of Eponine; Enjolras, Courfeyrac, Jean Prouvaire, Combeferre,\nBossuet, Grantaire, all his friends rose erect before him, then\ndispersed into thin air. Were all those dear, sorrowful, valiant,\ncharming or tragic beings merely dreams? had they actually existed? The\nrevolt had enveloped everything in its smoke. These great fevers create\ngreat dreams. He questioned himself; he felt himself; all these vanished\nrealities made him dizzy. Where were they all then? was it really true\nthat all were dead? A fall into the shadows had carried off all except\nhimself. It all seemed to him to have disappeared as though behind the\ncurtain of a theatre. There are curtains like this which drop in life.\nGod passes on to the following act.\n\nAnd he himself--was he actually the same man? He, the poor man, was\nrich; he, the abandoned, had a family; he, the despairing, was to marry\nCosette. It seemed to him that he had traversed a tomb, and that he had\nentered into it black and had emerged from it white, and in that tomb\nthe others had remained. At certain moments, all these beings of the\npast, returned and present, formed a circle around him, and overshadowed\nhim; then he thought of Cosette, and recovered his serenity; but nothing\nless than this felicity could have sufficed to efface that catastrophe.\n\nM. Fauchelevent almost occupied a place among these vanished beings.\nMarius hesitated to believe that the Fauchelevent of the barricade was\nthe same as this Fauchelevent in flesh and blood, sitting so gravely\nbeside Cosette. The first was, probably, one of those nightmares\noccasioned and brought back by his hours of delirium. However,\nthe natures of both men were rigid, no question from Marius to M.\nFauchelevent was possible. Such an idea had not even occurred to him. We\nhave already indicated this characteristic detail.\n\nTwo men who have a secret in common, and who, by a sort of tacit\nagreement, exchange not a word on the subject, are less rare than is\ncommonly supposed.\n\nOnce only, did Marius make the attempt. He introduced into the\nconversation the Rue de la Chanvrerie, and, turning to M. Fauchelevent,\nhe said to him:\n\n\"Of course, you are acquainted with that street?\"\n\n\"What street?\"\n\n\"The Rue de la Chanvrerie.\"\n\n\"I have no idea of the name of that street,\" replied M. Fauchelevent, in\nthe most natural manner in the world.\n\nThe response which bore upon the name of the street and not upon the\nstreet itself, appeared to Marius to be more conclusive than it really\nwas.\n\n\"Decidedly,\" thought he, \"I have been dreaming. I have been subject to\na hallucination. It was some one who resembled him. M. Fauchelevent was\nnot there.\"'\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII--TWO MEN IMPOSSIBLE TO FIND\n\nMarius' enchantment, great as it was, could not efface from his mind\nother pre-occupations.\n\nWhile the wedding was in preparation, and while awaiting the date fixed\nupon, he caused difficult and scrupulous retrospective researches to be\nmade.\n\nHe owed gratitude in various quarters; he owed it on his father's\naccount, he owed it on his own.\n\nThere was Thenardier; there was the unknown man who had brought him,\nMarius, back to M. Gillenormand.\n\nMarius endeavored to find these two men, not intending to marry, to\nbe happy, and to forget them, and fearing that, were these debts of\ngratitude not discharged, they would leave a shadow on his life, which\npromised so brightly for the future.\n\nIt was impossible for him to leave all these arrears of suffering behind\nhim, and he wished, before entering joyously into the future, to obtain\na quittance from the past.\n\nThat Thenardier was a villain detracted nothing from the fact that he\nhad saved Colonel Pontmercy. Thenardier was a ruffian in the eyes of all\nthe world except Marius.\n\nAnd Marius, ignorant of the real scene in the battle field of Waterloo,\nwas not aware of the peculiar detail, that his father, so far as\nThenardier was concerned was in the strange position of being indebted\nto the latter for his life, without being indebted to him for any\ngratitude.\n\nNone of the various agents whom Marius employed succeeded in discovering\nany trace of Thenardier. Obliteration appeared to be complete in\nthat quarter. Madame Thenardier had died in prison pending the trial.\nThenardier and his daughter Azelma, the only two remaining of that\nlamentable group, had plunged back into the gloom. The gulf of the\nsocial unknown had silently closed above those beings. On the surface\nthere was not visible so much as that quiver, that trembling, those\nobscure concentric circles which announce that something has fallen in,\nand that the plummet may be dropped.\n\nMadame Thenardier being dead, Boulatruelle being eliminated from the\ncase, Claquesous having disappeared, the principal persons accused\nhaving escaped from prison, the trial connected with the ambush in the\nGorbeau house had come to nothing.\n\nThat affair had remained rather obscure. The bench of Assizes had been\nobliged to content themselves with two subordinates. Panchaud, alias\nPrintanier, alias Bigrenaille, and Demi-Liard, alias Deux-Milliards, who\nhad been inconsistently condemned, after a hearing of both sides of\nthe case, to ten years in the galleys. Hard labor for life had been the\nsentence pronounced against the escaped and contumacious accomplices.\n\nThenardier, the head and leader, had been, through contumacy, likewise\ncondemned to death.\n\nThis sentence was the only information remaining about Thenardier,\ncasting upon that buried name its sinister light like a candle beside a\nbier.\n\nMoreover, by thrusting Thenardier back into the very remotest depths,\nthrough a fear of being re-captured, this sentence added to the density\nof the shadows which enveloped this man.\n\nAs for the other person, as for the unknown man who had saved Marius,\nthe researches were at first to some extent successful, then came to\nan abrupt conclusion. They succeeded in finding the carriage which had\nbrought Marius to the Rue des Filles-du-Calvaire on the evening of the\n6th of June.\n\nThe coachman declared that, on the 6th of June, in obedience to the\ncommands of a police-agent, he had stood from three o'clock in the\nafternoon until nightfall on the Quai des Champs-Elysees, above the\noutlet of the Grand Sewer; that, towards nine o'clock in the evening,\nthe grating of the sewer, which abuts on the bank of the river, had\nopened; that a man had emerged therefrom, bearing on his shoulders\nanother man, who seemed to be dead; that the agent, who was on the watch\nat that point, had arrested the living man and had seized the dead man;\nthat, at the order of the police-agent, he, the coachman, had taken \"all\nthose folks\" into his carriage; that they had first driven to the Rue\ndes Filles-du-Calvaire; that they had there deposited the dead man; that\nthe dead man was Monsieur Marius, and that he, the coachman, recognized\nhim perfectly, although he was alive \"this time\"; that afterwards, they\nhad entered the vehicle again, that he had whipped up his horses; a few\npaces from the gate of the Archives, they had called to him to halt;\nthat there, in the street, they had paid him and left him, and that the\npolice-agent had led the other man away; that he knew nothing more; that\nthe night had been very dark.\n\nMarius, as we have said, recalled nothing. He only remembered that he\nhad been seized from behind by an energetic hand at the moment when he\nwas falling backwards into the barricade; then, everything vanished so\nfar as he was concerned.\n\nHe had only regained consciousness at M. Gillenormand's.\n\nHe was lost in conjectures.\n\nHe could not doubt his own identity. Still, how had it come to pass\nthat, having fallen in the Rue de la Chanvrerie, he had been picked\nup by the police-agent on the banks of the Seine, near the Pont des\nInvalides?\n\nSome one had carried him from the Quartier des Halles to the\nChamps-Elysees. And how? Through the sewer. Unheard-of devotion!\n\nSome one? Who?\n\nThis was the man for whom Marius was searching.\n\nOf this man, who was his savior, nothing; not a trace; not the faintest\nindication.\n\nMarius, although forced to preserve great reserve, in that direction,\npushed his inquiries as far as the prefecture of police. There, no more\nthan elsewhere, did the information obtained lead to any enlightenment.\n\nThe prefecture knew less about the matter than did the hackney-coachman.\nThey had no knowledge of any arrest having been made on the 6th of June\nat the mouth of the Grand Sewer.\n\nNo report of any agent had been received there upon this matter, which\nwas regarded at the prefecture as a fable. The invention of this fable\nwas attributed to the coachman.\n\nA coachman who wants a gratuity is capable of anything, even of\nimagination. The fact was assured, nevertheless, and Marius could not\ndoubt it, unless he doubted his own identity, as we have just said.\n\nEverything about this singular enigma was inexplicable.\n\nWhat had become of that man, that mysterious man, whom the coachman had\nseen emerge from the grating of the Grand Sewer bearing upon his back\nthe unconscious Marius, and whom the police-agent on the watch had\narrested in the very act of rescuing an insurgent? What had become of\nthe agent himself?\n\nWhy had this agent preserved silence? Had the man succeeded in making\nhis escape? Had he bribed the agent? Why did this man give no sign of\nlife to Marius, who owed everything to him? His disinterestedness was no\nless tremendous than his devotion. Why had not that man appeared again?\nPerhaps he was above compensation, but no one is above gratitude. Was he\ndead? Who was the man? What sort of a face had he? No one could tell him\nthis.\n\nThe coachman answered: \"The night was very dark.\" Basque and Nicolette,\nall in a flutter, had looked only at their young master all covered with\nblood.\n\nThe porter, whose candle had lighted the tragic arrival of Marius, had\nbeen the only one to take note of the man in question, and this is the\ndescription that he gave:\n\n\"That man was terrible.\"\n\nMarius had the blood-stained clothing which he had worn when he had been\nbrought back to his grandfather preserved, in the hope that it would\nprove of service in his researches.\n\nOn examining the coat, it was found that one skirt had been torn in a\nsingular way. A piece was missing.\n\nOne evening, Marius was speaking in the presence of Cosette and Jean\nValjean of the whole of that singular adventure, of the innumerable\ninquiries which he had made, and of the fruitlessness of his efforts.\nThe cold countenance of \"Monsieur Fauchelevent\" angered him.\n\nHe exclaimed, with a vivacity which had something of wrath in it:\n\n\"Yes, that man, whoever he may have been, was sublime. Do you know what\nhe did, sir? He intervened like an archangel. He must have flung himself\ninto the midst of the battle, have stolen me away, have opened the\nsewer, have dragged me into it and have carried me through it! He\nmust have traversed more than a league and a half in those frightful\nsubterranean galleries, bent over, weighed down, in the dark, in the\ncess-pool,--more than a league and a half, sir, with a corpse upon his\nback! And with what object? With the sole object of saving the corpse.\nAnd that corpse I was. He said to himself: 'There may still be a\nglimpse of life there, perchance; I will risk my own existence for that\nmiserable spark!' And his existence he risked not once but twenty times!\nAnd every step was a danger. The proof of it is, that on emerging from\nthe sewer, he was arrested. Do you know, sir, that that man did all\nthis? And he had no recompense to expect. What was I? An insurgent.\nWhat was I? One of the conquered. Oh! if Cosette's six hundred thousand\nfrancs were mine . . .\"\n\n\"They are yours,\" interrupted Jean Valjean.\n\n\"Well,\" resumed Marius, \"I would give them all to find that man once\nmore.\"\n\nJean Valjean remained silent.\n\n\n\n\nBOOK SIXTH.--THE SLEEPLESS NIGHT\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I--THE 16TH OF FEBRUARY, 1833\n\nThe night of the 16th to the 17th of February, 1833, was a blessed\nnight. Above its shadows heaven stood open. It was the wedding night of\nMarius and Cosette.\n\nThe day had been adorable.\n\nIt had not been the grand festival dreamed by the grandfather, a fairy\nspectacle, with a confusion of cherubim and Cupids over the heads of the\nbridal pair, a marriage worthy to form the subject of a painting to be\nplaced over a door; but it had been sweet and smiling.\n\nThe manner of marriage in 1833 was not the same as it is to-day. France\nhad not yet borrowed from England that supreme delicacy of carrying off\none's wife, of fleeing, on coming out of church, of hiding oneself with\nshame from one's happiness, and of combining the ways of a bankrupt with\nthe delights of the Song of Songs. People had not yet grasped to the\nfull the chastity, exquisiteness, and decency of jolting their paradise\nin a posting-chaise, of breaking up their mystery with clic-clacs, of\ntaking for a nuptial bed the bed of an inn, and of leaving behind them,\nin a commonplace chamber, at such a night, the most sacred of\nthe souvenirs of life mingled pell-mell with the tete-a-tete of the\nconductor of the diligence and the maid-servant of the inn.\n\nIn this second half of the nineteenth century in which we are now\nliving, the mayor and his scarf, the priest and his chasuble, the law\nand God no longer suffice; they must be eked out by the Postilion de\nLonjumeau; a blue waistcoat turned up with red, and with bell buttons,\na plaque like a vantbrace, knee-breeches of green leather, oaths to the\nNorman horses with their tails knotted up, false galloons, varnished\nhat, long powdered locks, an enormous whip and tall boots. France does\nnot yet carry elegance to the length of doing like the English nobility,\nand raining down on the post-chaise of the bridal pair a hail storm\nof slippers trodden down at heel and of worn-out shoes, in memory of\nChurchill, afterwards Marlborough, or Malbrouck, who was assailed on\nhis wedding-day by the wrath of an aunt which brought him good luck.\nOld shoes and slippers do not, as yet, form a part of our nuptial\ncelebrations; but patience, as good taste continues to spread, we shall\ncome to that.\n\nIn 1833, a hundred years ago, marriage was not conducted at a full trot.\n\nStrange to say, at that epoch, people still imagined that a wedding was\na private and social festival, that a patriarchal banquet does not\nspoil a domestic solemnity, that gayety, even in excess, provided it be\nhonest, and decent, does happiness no harm, and that, in short, it is a\ngood and a venerable thing that the fusion of these two destinies whence\na family is destined to spring, should begin at home, and that the\nhousehold should thenceforth have its nuptial chamber as its witness.\n\nAnd people were so immodest as to marry in their own homes.\n\nThe marriage took place, therefore, in accordance with this now\nsuperannuated fashion, at M. Gillenormand's house.\n\nNatural and commonplace as this matter of marrying is, the banns to\npublish, the papers to be drawn up, the mayoralty, and the church\nproduce some complication. They could not get ready before the 16th of\nFebruary.\n\nNow, we note this detail, for the pure satisfaction of being exact, it\nchanced that the 16th fell on Shrove Tuesday. Hesitations, scruples,\nparticularly on the part of Aunt Gillenormand.\n\n\"Shrove Tuesday!\" exclaimed the grandfather, \"so much the better. There\nis a proverb:\n\n                \"'Mariage un Mardi gras\n                  N'aura point enfants ingrats.'[66]\n\n\nLet us proceed. Here goes for the 16th! Do you want to delay, Marius?\"\n\n\"No, certainly not!\" replied the lover.\n\n\"Let us marry, then,\" cried the grandfather.\n\nAccordingly, the marriage took place on the 16th, notwithstanding the\npublic merrymaking. It rained that day, but there is always in the sky\na tiny scrap of blue at the service of happiness, which lovers see, even\nwhen the rest of creation is under an umbrella.\n\nOn the preceding evening, Jean Valjean handed to Marius, in the presence\nof M. Gillenormand, the five hundred and eighty-four thousand francs.\n\nAs the marriage was taking place under the regime of community of\nproperty, the papers had been simple.\n\nHenceforth, Toussaint was of no use to Jean Valjean; Cosette inherited\nher and promoted her to the rank of lady's maid.\n\nAs for Jean Valjean, a beautiful chamber in the Gillenormand house had\nbeen furnished expressly for him, and Cosette had said to him in such\nan irresistible manner: \"Father, I entreat you,\" that she had almost\npersuaded him to promise that he would come and occupy it.\n\nA few days before that fixed on for the marriage, an accident happened\nto Jean Valjean; he crushed the thumb of his right hand. This was not a\nserious matter; and he had not allowed any one to trouble himself\nabout it, nor to dress it, nor even to see his hurt, not even Cosette.\nNevertheless, this had forced him to swathe his hand in a linen bandage,\nand to carry his arm in a sling, and had prevented his signing. M.\nGillenormand, in his capacity of Cosette's supervising-guardian, had\nsupplied his place.\n\nWe will not conduct the reader either to the mayor's office or to the\nchurch. One does not follow a pair of lovers to that extent, and one is\naccustomed to turn one's back on the drama as soon as it puts a wedding\nnosegay in its buttonhole. We will confine ourselves to noting an\nincident which, though unnoticed by the wedding party, marked the\ntransit from the Rue des Filles-du-Calvaire to the church of Saint-Paul.\n\nAt that epoch, the northern extremity of the Rue Saint-Louis was in\nprocess of repaving. It was barred off, beginning with the Rue du\nPare-Royal. It was impossible for the wedding carriages to go directly\nto Saint-Paul. They were obliged to alter their course, and the simplest\nway was to turn through the boulevard. One of the invited guests\nobserved that it was Shrove Tuesday, and that there would be a jam\nof vehicles.--\"Why?\" asked M. Gillenormand--\"Because of the\nmaskers.\"--\"Capital,\" said the grandfather, \"let us go that way. These\nyoung folks are on the way to be married; they are about to enter the\nserious part of life. This will prepare them for seeing a bit of the\nmasquerade.\"\n\nThey went by way of the boulevard. The first wedding coach held Cosette\nand Aunt Gillenormand, M. Gillenormand and Jean Valjean. Marius, still\nseparated from his betrothed according to usage, did not come until\nthe second. The nuptial train, on emerging from the Rue des\nFilles-du-Calvaire, became entangled in a long procession of vehicles\nwhich formed an endless chain from the Madeleine to the Bastille, and\nfrom the Bastille to the Madeleine. Maskers abounded on the boulevard.\nIn spite of the fact that it was raining at intervals, Merry-Andrew,\nPantaloon and Clown persisted. In the good humor of that winter of 1833,\nParis had disguised itself as Venice. Such Shrove Tuesdays are no\nlonger to be seen now-a-days. Everything which exists being a scattered\nCarnival, there is no longer any Carnival.\n\nThe sidewalks were overflowing with pedestrians and the windows with\ncurious spectators. The terraces which crown the peristyles of the\ntheatres were bordered with spectators. Besides the maskers, they stared\nat that procession--peculiar to Shrove Tuesday as to Longchamps,--of\nvehicles of every description, citadines, tapissieres, carioles,\ncabriolets marching in order, rigorously riveted to each other by the\npolice regulations, and locked into rails, as it were. Any one in\nthese vehicles is at once a spectator and a spectacle. Police-sergeants\nmaintained, on the sides of the boulevard, these two interminable\nparallel files, moving in contrary directions, and saw to it that\nnothing interfered with that double current, those two brooks of\ncarriages, flowing, the one down stream, the other up stream, the\none towards the Chaussee d'Antin, the other towards the Faubourg\nSaint-Antoine. The carriages of the peers of France and of the\nAmbassadors, emblazoned with coats of arms, held the middle of the way,\ngoing and coming freely. Certain joyous and magnificent trains, notably\nthat of the Boeuf Gras, had the same privilege. In this gayety of Paris,\nEngland cracked her whip; Lord Seymour's post-chaise, harassed by a\nnickname from the populace, passed with great noise.\n\nIn the double file, along which the municipal guards galloped like\nsheep-dogs, honest family coaches, loaded down with great-aunts and\ngrandmothers, displayed at their doors fresh groups of children in\ndisguise, Clowns of seven years of age, Columbines of six, ravishing\nlittle creatures, who felt that they formed an official part of the\npublic mirth, who were imbued with the dignity of their harlequinade,\nand who possessed the gravity of functionaries.\n\nFrom time to time, a hitch arose somewhere in the procession of\nvehicles; one or other of the two lateral files halted until the knot\nwas disentangled; one carriage delayed sufficed to paralyze the whole\nline. Then they set out again on the march.\n\nThe wedding carriages were in the file proceeding towards the Bastille,\nand skirting the right side of the Boulevard. At the top of the\nPont-aux-Choux, there was a stoppage. Nearly at the same moment, the\nother file, which was proceeding towards the Madeleine, halted also. At\nthat point of the file there was a carriage-load of maskers.\n\nThese carriages, or to speak more correctly, these wagon-loads of\nmaskers are very familiar to Parisians. If they were missing on a Shrove\nTuesday, or at the Mid-Lent, it would be taken in bad part, and people\nwould say: \"There's something behind that. Probably the ministry\nis about to undergo a change.\" A pile of Cassandras, Harlequins and\nColumbines, jolted along high above the passers-by, all possible\ngrotesquenesses, from the Turk to the savage, Hercules supporting\nMarquises, fishwives who would have made Rabelais stop up his ears just\nas the Maenads made Aristophanes drop his eyes, tow wigs, pink tights,\ndandified hats, spectacles of a grimacer, three-cornered hats of Janot\ntormented with a butterfly, shouts directed at pedestrians, fists on\nhips, bold attitudes, bare shoulders, immodesty unchained; a chaos of\nshamelessness driven by a coachman crowned with flowers; this is what\nthat institution was like.\n\nGreece stood in need of the chariot of Thespis, France stands in need of\nthe hackney-coach of Vade.\n\nEverything can be parodied, even parody. The Saturnalia, that grimace of\nantique beauty, ends, through exaggeration after exaggeration, in Shrove\nTuesday; and the Bacchanal, formerly crowned with sprays of vine leaves\nand grapes, inundated with sunshine, displaying her marble breast in a\ndivine semi-nudity, having at the present day lost her shape under\nthe soaked rags of the North, has finally come to be called the\nJack-pudding.\n\nThe tradition of carriage-loads of maskers runs back to the most ancient\ndays of the monarchy. The accounts of Louis XI. allot to the bailiff of\nthe palace \"twenty sous, Tournois, for three coaches of mascarades\nin the cross-roads.\" In our day, these noisy heaps of creatures are\naccustomed to have themselves driven in some ancient cuckoo carriage,\nwhose imperial they load down, or they overwhelm a hired landau, with\nits top thrown back, with their tumultuous groups. Twenty of them ride\nin a carriage intended for six. They cling to the seats, to the rumble,\non the cheeks of the hood, on the shafts. They even bestride the\ncarriage lamps. They stand, sit, lie, with their knees drawn up in a\nknot, and their legs hanging. The women sit on the men's laps. Far\naway, above the throng of heads, their wild pyramid is visible. These\ncarriage-loads form mountains of mirth in the midst of the rout. Colle,\nPanard and Piron flow from it, enriched with slang. This carriage which\nhas become colossal through its freight, has an air of conquest. Uproar\nreigns in front, tumult behind. People vociferate, shout, howl, there\nthey break forth and writhe with enjoyment; gayety roars; sarcasm flames\nforth, joviality is flaunted like a red flag; two jades there drag farce\nblossomed forth into an apotheosis; it is the triumphal car of laughter.\n\nA laughter that is too cynical to be frank. In truth, this laughter is\nsuspicious. This laughter has a mission. It is charged with proving the\nCarnival to the Parisians.\n\nThese fishwife vehicles, in which one feels one knows not what shadows,\nset the philosopher to thinking. There is government therein. There one\nlays one's finger on a mysterious affinity between public men and public\nwomen.\n\nIt certainly is sad that turpitude heaped up should give a sum total\nof gayety, that by piling ignominy upon opprobrium the people should\nbe enticed, that the system of spying, and serving as caryatids to\nprostitution should amuse the rabble when it confronts them, that the\ncrowd loves to behold that monstrous living pile of tinsel rags, half\ndung, half light, roll by on four wheels howling and laughing, that they\nshould clap their hands at this glory composed of all shames, that there\nwould be no festival for the populace, did not the police promenade in\ntheir midst these sorts of twenty-headed hydras of joy. But what can be\ndone about it? These be-ribboned and be-flowered tumbrils of mire are\ninsulted and pardoned by the laughter of the public. The laughter of all\nis the accomplice of universal degradation. Certain unhealthy festivals\ndisaggregate the people and convert them into the populace. And\npopulaces, like tyrants, require buffoons. The King has Roquelaure,\nthe populace has the Merry-Andrew. Paris is a great, mad city on every\noccasion that it is a great sublime city. There the Carnival forms\npart of politics. Paris,--let us confess it--willingly allows infamy to\nfurnish it with comedy. She only demands of her masters--when she has\nmasters--one thing: \"Paint me the mud.\" Rome was of the same mind. She\nloved Nero. Nero was a titanic lighterman.\n\nChance ordained, as we have just said, that one of these shapeless\nclusters of masked men and women, dragged about on a vast calash, should\nhalt on the left of the boulevard, while the wedding train halted on the\nright. The carriage-load of masks caught sight of the wedding carriage\ncontaining the bridal party opposite them on the other side of the\nboulevard.\n\n\"Hullo!\" said a masker, \"here's a wedding.\"\n\n\"A sham wedding,\" retorted another. \"We are the genuine article.\"\n\nAnd, being too far off to accost the wedding party, and fearing also,\nthe rebuke of the police, the two maskers turned their eyes elsewhere.\n\nAt the end of another minute, the carriage-load of maskers had their\nhands full, the multitude set to yelling, which is the crowd's caress\nto masquerades; and the two maskers who had just spoken had to face the\nthrong with their comrades, and did not find the entire repertory of\nprojectiles of the fishmarkets too extensive to retort to the enormous\nverbal attacks of the populace. A frightful exchange of metaphors took\nplace between the maskers and the crowd.\n\nIn the meanwhile, two other maskers in the same carriage, a Spaniard\nwith an enormous nose, an elderly air, and huge black moustache, and a\ngaunt fishwife, who was quite a young girl, masked with a loup,[67] had\nalso noticed the wedding, and while their companions and the passers-by\nwere exchanging insults, they had held a dialogue in a low voice.\n\nTheir aside was covered by the tumult and was lost in it. The gusts of\nrain had drenched the front of the vehicle, which was wide open; the\nbreezes of February are not warm; as the fishwife, clad in a low-necked\ngown, replied to the Spaniard, she shivered, laughed and coughed.\n\nHere is their dialogue:\n\n\"Say, now.\"\n\n\"What, daddy?\"\n\n\"Do you see that old cove?\"\n\n\"What old cove?\"\n\n\"Yonder, in the first wedding-cart, on our side.\"\n\n\"The one with his arm hung up in a black cravat?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Well?\"\n\n\"I'm sure that I know him.\"\n\n\"Ah!\"\n\n\"I'm willing that they should cut my throat, and I'm ready to swear that\nI never said either you, thou, or I, in my life, if I don't know that\nParisian.\" [pantinois.]\n\n\"Paris in Pantin to-day.\"\n\n\"Can you see the bride if you stoop down?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"And the bridegroom?\"\n\n\"There's no bridegroom in that trap.\"\n\n\"Bah!\"\n\n\"Unless it's the old fellow.\"\n\n\"Try to get a sight of the bride by stooping very low.\"\n\n\"I can't.\"\n\n\"Never mind, that old cove who has something the matter with his paw I\nknow, and that I'm positive.\"\n\n\"And what good does it do to know him?\"\n\n\"No one can tell. Sometimes it does!\"\n\n\"I don't care a hang for old fellows, that I don't!\"\n\n\"I know him.\"\n\n\"Know him, if you want to.\"\n\n\"How the devil does he come to be one of the wedding party?\"\n\n\"We are in it, too.\"\n\n\"Where does that wedding come from?\"\n\n\"How should I know?\"\n\n\"Listen.\"\n\n\"Well, what?\"\n\n\"There's one thing you ought to do.\"\n\n\"What's that?\"\n\n\"Get off of our trap and spin that wedding.\"\n\n\"What for?\"\n\n\"To find out where it goes, and what it is. Hurry up and jump down,\ntrot, my girl, your legs are young.\"\n\n\"I can't quit the vehicle.\"\n\n\"Why not?\"\n\n\"I'm hired.\"\n\n\"Ah, the devil!\"\n\n\"I owe my fishwife day to the prefecture.\"\n\n\"That's true.\"\n\n\"If I leave the cart, the first inspector who gets his eye on me will\narrest me. You know that well enough.\"\n\n\"Yes, I do.\"\n\n\"I'm bought by the government for to-day.\"\n\n\"All the same, that old fellow bothers me.\"\n\n\"Do the old fellows bother you? But you're not a young girl.\"\n\n\"He's in the first carriage.\"\n\n\"Well?\"\n\n\"In the bride's trap.\"\n\n\"What then?\"\n\n\"So he is the father.\"\n\n\"What concern is that of mine?\"\n\n\"I tell you that he's the father.\"\n\n\"As if he were the only father.\"\n\n\"Listen.\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"I can't go out otherwise than masked. Here I'm concealed, no one knows\nthat I'm here. But to-morrow, there will be no more maskers. It's Ash\nWednesday. I run the risk of being nabbed. I must sneak back into my\nhole. But you are free.\"\n\n\"Not particularly.\"\n\n\"More than I am, at any rate.\"\n\n\"Well, what of that?\"\n\n\"You must try to find out where that wedding-party went to.\"\n\n\"Where it went?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"I know.\"\n\n\"Where is it going then?\"\n\n\"To the Cadran-Bleu.\"\n\n\"In the first place, it's not in that direction.\"\n\n\"Well! to la Rapee.\"\n\n\"Or elsewhere.\"\n\n\"It's free. Wedding-parties are at liberty.\"\n\n\"That's not the point at all. I tell you that you must try to learn for\nme what that wedding is, who that old cove belongs to, and where that\nwedding pair lives.\"\n\n\"I like that! that would be queer. It's so easy to find out a\nwedding-party that passed through the street on a Shrove Tuesday, a week\nafterwards. A pin in a hay-mow! It ain't possible!\"\n\n\"That don't matter. You must try. You understand me, Azelma.\"\n\nThe two files resumed their movement on both sides of the boulevard, in\nopposite directions, and the carriage of the maskers lost sight of the\n\"trap\" of the bride.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II--JEAN VALJEAN STILL WEARS HIS ARM IN A SLING\n\nTo realize one's dream. To whom is this accorded? There must be\nelections for this in heaven; we are all candidates, unknown to\nourselves; the angels vote. Cosette and Marius had been elected.\n\nCosette, both at the mayor's office and at church, was dazzling and\ntouching. Toussaint, assisted by Nicolette, had dressed her.\n\nCosette wore over a petticoat of white taffeta, her robe of Binche\nguipure, a veil of English point, a necklace of fine pearls, a wreath\nof orange flowers; all this was white, and, from the midst of that\nwhiteness she beamed forth. It was an exquisite candor expanding and\nbecoming transfigured in the light. One would have pronounced her a\nvirgin on the point of turning into a goddess.\n\nMarius' handsome hair was lustrous and perfumed; here and there, beneath\nthe thick curls, pale lines--the scars of the barricade--were visible.\n\nThe grandfather, haughty, with head held high, amalgamating more than\never in his toilet and his manners all the elegances of the epoch of\nBarras, escorted Cosette. He took the place of Jean Valjean, who, on\naccount of his arm being still in a sling, could not give his hand to\nthe bride.\n\nJean Valjean, dressed in black, followed them with a smile.\n\n\"Monsieur Fauchelevent,\" said the grandfather to him, \"this is a fine\nday. I vote for the end of afflictions and sorrows. Henceforth, there\nmust be no sadness anywhere. Pardieu, I decree joy! Evil has no right to\nexist. That there should be any unhappy men is, in sooth, a disgrace\nto the azure of the sky. Evil does not come from man, who is good at\nbottom. All human miseries have for their capital and central government\nhell, otherwise, known as the Devil's Tuileries. Good, here I am\nuttering demagogical words! As far as I am concerned, I have no longer\nany political opinions; let all me be rich, that is to say, mirthful,\nand I confine myself to that.\"\n\nWhen, at the conclusion of all the ceremonies, after having pronounced\nbefore the mayor and before the priest all possible \"yesses,\" after\nhaving signed the registers at the municipality and at the sacristy,\nafter having exchanged their rings, after having knelt side by side\nunder the pall of white moire in the smoke of the censer, they arrived,\nhand in hand, admired and envied by all, Marius in black, she in white,\npreceded by the suisse, with the epaulets of a colonel, tapping the\npavement with his halberd, between two rows of astonished spectators, at\nthe portals of the church, both leaves of which were thrown wide open,\nready to enter their carriage again, and all being finished, Cosette\nstill could not believe that it was real. She looked at Marius, she\nlooked at the crowd, she looked at the sky: it seemed as though she\nfeared that she should wake up from her dream. Her amazed and uneasy air\nadded something indescribably enchanting to her beauty. They entered the\nsame carriage to return home, Marius beside Cosette; M. Gillenormand\nand Jean Valjean sat opposite them; Aunt Gillenormand had withdrawn one\ndegree, and was in the second vehicle.\n\n\"My children,\" said the grandfather, \"here you are, Monsieur le Baron\nand Madame la Baronne, with an income of thirty thousand livres.\"\n\nAnd Cosette, nestling close to Marius, caressed his ear with an angelic\nwhisper: \"So it is true. My name is Marius. I am Madame Thou.\"\n\nThese two creatures were resplendent. They had reached that irrevocable\nand irrecoverable moment, at the dazzling intersection of all youth and\nall joy. They realized the verses of Jean Prouvaire; they were forty\nyears old taken together. It was marriage sublimated; these two children\nwere two lilies. They did not see each other, they did not contemplate\neach other. Cosette perceived Marius in the midst of a glory; Marius\nperceived Cosette on an altar. And on that altar, and in that glory, the\ntwo apotheoses mingling, in the background, one knows not how, behind a\ncloud for Cosette, in a flash for Marius, there was the ideal thing, the\nreal thing, the meeting of the kiss and the dream, the nuptial pillow.\nAll the torments through which they had passed came back to them in\nintoxication. It seemed to them that their sorrows, their sleepless\nnights, their tears, their anguish, their terrors, their despair,\nconverted into caresses and rays of light, rendered still more charming\nthe charming hour which was approaching; and that their griefs were but\nso many handmaidens who were preparing the toilet of joy. How good it is\nto have suffered! Their unhappiness formed a halo round their happiness.\nThe long agony of their love was terminating in an ascension.\n\nIt was the same enchantment in two souls, tinged with voluptuousness\nin Marius, and with modesty in Cosette. They said to each other in low\ntones: \"We will go back to take a look at our little garden in the Rue\nPlumet.\" The folds of Cosette's gown lay across Marius.\n\nSuch a day is an ineffable mixture of dream and of reality. One\npossesses and one supposes. One still has time before one to divine. The\nemotion on that day, of being at mid-day and of dreaming of midnight\nis indescribable. The delights of these two hearts overflowed upon the\ncrowd, and inspired the passers-by with cheerfulness.\n\nPeople halted in the Rue Saint-Antoine, in front of Saint-Paul, to gaze\nthrough the windows of the carriage at the orange-flowers quivering on\nCosette's head.\n\nThen they returned home to the Rue des Filles-du-Calvaire. Marius,\ntriumphant and radiant, mounted side by side with Cosette the staircase\nup which he had been borne in a dying condition. The poor, who had\ntrooped to the door, and who shared their purses, blessed them. There\nwere flowers everywhere. The house was no less fragrant than the church;\nafter the incense, roses. They thought they heard voices carolling in\nthe infinite; they had God in their hearts; destiny appeared to them\nlike a ceiling of stars; above their heads they beheld the light of a\nrising sun. All at once, the clock struck. Marius glanced at Cosette's\ncharming bare arm, and at the rosy things which were vaguely visible\nthrough the lace of her bodice, and Cosette, intercepting Marius'\nglance, blushed to her very hair.\n\nQuite a number of old family friends of the Gillenormand family had\nbeen invited; they pressed about Cosette. Each one vied with the rest in\nsaluting her as Madame la Baronne.\n\nThe officer, Theodule Gillenormand, now a captain, had come from\nChartres, where he was stationed in garrison, to be present at the\nwedding of his cousin Pontmercy. Cosette did not recognize him.\n\nHe, on his side, habituated as he was to have women consider him\nhandsome, retained no more recollection of Cosette than of any other\nwoman.\n\n\"How right I was not to believe in that story about the lancer!\" said\nFather Gillenormand, to himself.\n\nCosette had never been more tender with Jean Valjean. She was in unison\nwith Father Gillenormand; while he erected joy into aphorisms and\nmaxims, she exhaled goodness like a perfume. Happiness desires that all\nthe world should be happy.\n\nShe regained, for the purpose of addressing Jean Valjean, inflections of\nvoice belonging to the time when she was a little girl. She caressed him\nwith her smile.\n\nA banquet had been spread in the dining-room.\n\nIllumination as brilliant as the daylight is the necessary seasoning of\na great joy. Mist and obscurity are not accepted by the happy. They do\nnot consent to be black. The night, yes; the shadows, no. If there is no\nsun, one must be made.\n\nThe dining-room was full of gay things. In the centre, above the white\nand glittering table, was a Venetian lustre with flat plates, with all\nsorts of colored birds, blue, violet, red, and green, perched amid the\ncandles; around the chandelier, girandoles, on the walls, sconces with\ntriple and quintuple branches; mirrors, silverware, glassware, plate,\nporcelain, faience, pottery, gold and silversmith's work, all was\nsparkling and gay. The empty spaces between the candelabra were filled\nin with bouquets, so that where there was not a light, there was a\nflower.\n\nIn the antechamber, three violins and a flute softly played quartettes\nby Haydn.\n\nJean Valjean had seated himself on a chair in the drawing-room, behind\nthe door, the leaf of which folded back upon him in such a manner as to\nnearly conceal him. A few moments before they sat down to table, Cosette\ncame, as though inspired by a sudden whim, and made him a deep courtesy,\nspreading out her bridal toilet with both hands, and with a tenderly\nroguish glance, she asked him:\n\n\"Father, are you satisfied?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Jean Valjean, \"I am content!\"\n\n\"Well, then, laugh.\"\n\nJean Valjean began to laugh.\n\nA few moments later, Basque announced that dinner was served.\n\nThe guests, preceded by M. Gillenormand with Cosette on his arm, entered\nthe dining-room, and arranged themselves in the proper order around the\ntable.\n\nTwo large arm-chairs figured on the right and left of the bride, the\nfirst for M. Gillenormand, the other for Jean Valjean. M. Gillenormand\ntook his seat. The other arm-chair remained empty.\n\nThey looked about for M. Fauchelevent.\n\nHe was no longer there.\n\nM. Gillenormand questioned Basque.\n\n\"Do you know where M. Fauchelevent is?\"\n\n\"Sir,\" replied Basque, \"I do, precisely. M. Fauchelevent told me to say\nto you, sir, that he was suffering, his injured hand was paining him\nsomewhat, and that he could not dine with Monsieur le Baron and Madame\nla Baronne. That he begged to be excused, that he would come to-morrow.\nHe has just taken his departure.\"\n\nThat empty arm-chair chilled the effusion of the wedding feast for a\nmoment. But, if M. Fauchelevent was absent, M. Gillenormand was present,\nand the grandfather beamed for two. He affirmed that M. Fauchelevent had\ndone well to retire early, if he were suffering, but that it was only a\nslight ailment. This declaration sufficed. Moreover, what is an obscure\ncorner in such a submersion of joy? Cosette and Marius were passing\nthrough one of those egotistical and blessed moments when no other\nfaculty is left to a person than that of receiving happiness. And then,\nan idea occurred to M. Gillenormand.--\"Pardieu, this armchair is empty.\nCome hither, Marius. Your aunt will permit it, although she has a\nright to you. This armchair is for you. That is legal and delightful.\nFortunatus beside Fortunata.\"--Applause from the whole table. Marius\ntook Jean Valjean's place beside Cosette, and things fell out so that\nCosette, who had, at first, been saddened by Jean Valjean's absence,\nended by being satisfied with it. From the moment when Marius took his\nplace, and was the substitute, Cosette would not have regretted God\nhimself. She set her sweet little foot, shod in white satin, on Marius'\nfoot.\n\nThe arm-chair being occupied, M. Fauchelevent was obliterated; and\nnothing was lacking.\n\nAnd, five minutes afterward, the whole table from one end to the other,\nwas laughing with all the animation of forgetfulness.\n\nAt dessert, M. Gillenormand, rising to his feet, with a glass of\nchampagne in his hand--only half full so that the palsy of his eighty\nyears might not cause an overflow,--proposed the health of the married\npair.\n\n\"You shall not escape two sermons,\" he exclaimed. \"This morning you\nhad one from the cure, this evening you shall have one from your\ngrandfather. Listen to me; I will give you a bit of advice: Adore each\nother. I do not make a pack of gyrations, I go straight to the mark,\nbe happy. In all creation, only the turtle-doves are wise. Philosophers\nsay: 'Moderate your joys.' I say: 'Give rein to your joys.' Be as\nmuch smitten with each other as fiends. Be in a rage about it. The\nphilosophers talk stuff and nonsense. I should like to stuff their\nphilosophy down their gullets again. Can there be too many perfumes,\ntoo many open rose-buds, too many nightingales singing, too many green\nleaves, too much aurora in life? can people love each other too much?\ncan people please each other too much? Take care, Estelle, thou art too\npretty! Have a care, Nemorin, thou art too handsome! Fine stupidity,\nin sooth! Can people enchant each other too much, cajole each other too\nmuch, charm each other too much? Can one be too much alive, too happy?\nModerate your joys. Ah, indeed! Down with the philosophers! Wisdom\nconsists in jubilation. Make merry, let us make merry. Are we happy\nbecause we are good, or are we good because we are happy? Is the Sancy\ndiamond called the Sancy because it belonged to Harley de Sancy, or\nbecause it weighs six hundred carats? I know nothing about it, life is\nfull of such problems; the important point is to possess the Sancy and\nhappiness. Let us be happy without quibbling and quirking. Let us obey\nthe sun blindly. What is the sun? It is love. He who says love, says\nwoman. Ah! ah! behold omnipotence--women. Ask that demagogue of a Marius\nif he is not the slave of that little tyrant of a Cosette. And of his\nown free will, too, the coward! Woman! There is no Robespierre who keeps\nhis place but woman reigns. I am no longer Royalist except towards that\nroyalty. What is Adam? The kingdom of Eve. No '89 for Eve. There has\nbeen the royal sceptre surmounted by a fleur-de-lys, there has been the\nimperial sceptre surmounted by a globe, there has been the sceptre of\nCharlemagne, which was of iron, there has been the sceptre of Louis the\nGreat, which was of gold,--the revolution twisted them between its thumb\nand forefinger, ha'penny straws; it is done with, it is broken, it lies\non the earth, there is no longer any sceptre, but make me a revolution\nagainst that little embroidered handkerchief, which smells of patchouli!\nI should like to see you do it. Try. Why is it so solid? Because it is a\ngewgaw. Ah! you are the nineteenth century? Well, what then? And we\nhave been as foolish as you. Do not imagine that you have effected\nmuch change in the universe, because your trip-gallant is called the\ncholera-morbus, and because your pourree is called the cachuca. In fact,\nthe women must always be loved. I defy you to escape from that. These\nfriends are our angels. Yes, love, woman, the kiss forms a circle from\nwhich I defy you to escape; and, for my own part, I should be only\ntoo happy to re-enter it. Which of you has seen the planet Venus, the\ncoquette of the abyss, the Celimene of the ocean, rise in the infinite,\ncalming all here below? The ocean is a rough Alcestis. Well, grumble\nas he will, when Venus appears he is forced to smile. That brute beast\nsubmits. We are all made so. Wrath, tempest, claps of thunder, foam to\nthe very ceiling. A woman enters on the scene, a planet rises; flat on\nyour face! Marius was fighting six months ago; to-day he is married.\nThat is well. Yes, Marius, yes, Cosette, you are in the right. Exist\nboldly for each other, make us burst with rage that we cannot do the\nsame, idealize each other, catch in your beaks all the tiny blades of\nfelicity that exist on earth, and arrange yourselves a nest for life.\nPardi, to love, to be loved, what a fine miracle when one is young!\nDon't imagine that you have invented that. I, too, have had my dream, I,\ntoo, have meditated, I, too, have sighed; I, too, have had a moonlight\nsoul. Love is a child six thousand years old. Love has the right to a\nlong white beard. Methusalem is a street arab beside Cupid. For sixty\ncenturies men and women have got out of their scrape by loving. The\ndevil, who is cunning, took to hating man; man, who is still more\ncunning, took to loving woman. In this way he does more good than\nthe devil does him harm. This craft was discovered in the days of\nthe terrestrial paradise. The invention is old, my friends, but it is\nperfectly new. Profit by it. Be Daphnis and Chloe, while waiting to\nbecome Philemon and Baucis. Manage so that, when you are with each\nother, nothing shall be lacking to you, and that Cosette may be the sun\nfor Marius, and that Marius may be the universe to Cosette. Cosette, let\nyour fine weather be the smile of your husband; Marius, let your rain\nbe your wife's tears. And let it never rain in your household. You have\nfilched the winning number in the lottery; you have gained the great\nprize, guard it well, keep it under lock and key, do not squander it,\nadore each other and snap your fingers at all the rest. Believe what I\nsay to you. It is good sense. And good sense cannot lie. Be a religion\nto each other. Each man has his own fashion of adoring God. Saperlotte!\nthe best way to adore God is to love one's wife. I love thee! that's\nmy catechism. He who loves is orthodox. The oath of Henri IV. places\nsanctity somewhere between feasting and drunkenness. Ventre-saint-gris!\nI don't belong to the religion of that oath. Woman is forgotten in it.\nThis astonishes me on the part of Henri IV. My friends, long live women!\nI am old, they say; it's astonishing how much I feel in the mood to\nbe young. I should like to go and listen to the bagpipes in the woods.\nChildren who contrive to be beautiful and contented,--that intoxicates\nme. I would like greatly to get married, if any one would have me. It is\nimpossible to imagine that God could have made us for anything but this:\nto idolize, to coo, to preen ourselves, to be dove-like, to be dainty,\nto bill and coo our loves from morn to night, to gaze at one's image in\none's little wife, to be proud, to be triumphant, to plume oneself; that\nis the aim of life. There, let not that displease you which we used to\nthink in our day, when we were young folks. Ah! vertu-bamboche! what\ncharming women there were in those days, and what pretty little faces\nand what lovely lasses! I committed my ravages among them. Then love\neach other. If people did not love each other, I really do not see what\nuse there would be in having any springtime; and for my own part, I\nshould pray the good God to shut up all the beautiful things that he\nshows us, and to take away from us and put back in his box, the flowers,\nthe birds, and the pretty maidens. My children, receive an old man's\nblessing.\"\n\nThe evening was gay, lively and agreeable. The grandfather's sovereign\ngood humor gave the key-note to the whole feast, and each person\nregulated his conduct on that almost centenarian cordiality. They danced\na little, they laughed a great deal; it was an amiable wedding. Goodman\nDays of Yore might have been invited to it. However, he was present in\nthe person of Father Gillenormand.\n\nThere was a tumult, then silence.\n\nThe married pair disappeared.\n\nA little after midnight, the Gillenormand house became a temple.\n\nHere we pause. On the threshold of wedding nights stands a smiling angel\nwith his finger on his lips.\n\nThe soul enters into contemplation before that sanctuary where the\ncelebration of love takes place.\n\nThere should be flashes of light athwart such houses. The joy which\nthey contain ought to make its escape through the stones of the walls in\nbrilliancy, and vaguely illuminate the gloom. It is impossible that this\nsacred and fatal festival should not give off a celestial radiance to\nthe infinite. Love is the sublime crucible wherein the fusion of the man\nand the woman takes place; the being one, the being triple, the being\nfinal, the human trinity proceeds from it. This birth of two souls into\none, ought to be an emotion for the gloom. The lover is the priest;\nthe ravished virgin is terrified. Something of that joy ascends to God.\nWhere true marriage is, that is to say, where there is love, the ideal\nenters in. A nuptial bed makes a nook of dawn amid the shadows. If it\nwere given to the eye of the flesh to scan the formidable and charming\nvisions of the upper life, it is probable that we should behold the\nforms of night, the winged unknowns, the blue passers of the invisible,\nbend down, a throng of sombre heads, around the luminous house,\nsatisfied, showering benedictions, pointing out to each other the virgin\nwife gently alarmed, sweetly terrified, and bearing the reflection of\nhuman bliss upon their divine countenances. If at that supreme hour, the\nwedded pair, dazzled with voluptuousness and believing themselves alone,\nwere to listen, they would hear in their chamber a confused rustling of\nwings. Perfect happiness implies a mutual understanding with the angels.\nThat dark little chamber has all heaven for its ceiling. When two\nmouths, rendered sacred by love, approach to create, it is impossible\nthat there should not be, above that ineffable kiss, a quivering\nthroughout the immense mystery of stars.\n\nThese felicities are the true ones. There is no joy outside of these\njoys. Love is the only ecstasy. All the rest weeps.\n\nTo love, or to have loved,--this suffices. Demand nothing more. There\nis no other pearl to be found in the shadowy folds of life. To love is a\nfulfilment.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III--THE INSEPARABLE\n\nWhat had become of Jean Valjean?\n\nImmediately after having laughed, at Cosette's graceful command, when\nno one was paying any heed to him, Jean Valjean had risen and had gained\nthe antechamber unperceived. This was the very room which, eight months\nbefore, he had entered black with mud, with blood and powder, bringing\nback the grandson to the grandfather. The old wainscoting was garlanded\nwith foliage and flowers; the musicians were seated on the sofa on which\nthey had laid Marius down. Basque, in a black coat, knee-breeches, white\nstockings and white gloves, was arranging roses round all of the dishes\nthat were to be served. Jean Valjean pointed to his arm in its sling,\ncharged Basque to explain his absence, and went away.\n\nThe long windows of the dining-room opened on the street. Jean Valjean\nstood for several minutes, erect and motionless in the darkness, beneath\nthose radiant windows. He listened. The confused sounds of the banquet\nreached his ear. He heard the loud, commanding tones of the grandfather,\nthe violins, the clatter of the plates, the bursts of laughter, and\nthrough all that merry uproar, he distinguished Cosette's sweet and\njoyous voice.\n\nHe quitted the Rue des Filles-du-Calvaire, and returned to the Rue de\nl'Homme Arme.\n\nIn order to return thither, he took the Rue Saint-Louis, the Rue\nCulture-Sainte-Catherine, and the Blancs-Manteaux; it was a little\nlonger, but it was the road through which, for the last three months,\nhe had become accustomed to pass every day on his way from the Rue de\nl'Homme Arme to the Rue des Filles-du-Calvaire, in order to avoid the\nobstructions and the mud in the Rue Vielle-du-Temple.\n\nThis road, through which Cosette had passed, excluded for him all\npossibility of any other itinerary.\n\nJean Valjean entered his lodgings. He lighted his candle and mounted\nthe stairs. The apartment was empty. Even Toussaint was no longer there.\nJean Valjean's step made more noise than usual in the chambers. All the\ncupboards stood open. He penetrated to Cosette's bedroom. There were no\nsheets on the bed. The pillow, covered with ticking, and without a case\nor lace, was laid on the blankets folded up on the foot of the mattress,\nwhose covering was visible, and on which no one was ever to sleep again.\nAll the little feminine objects which Cosette was attached to had been\ncarried away; nothing remained except the heavy furniture and the four\nwalls. Toussaint's bed was despoiled in like manner. One bed only was\nmade up, and seemed to be waiting some one, and this was Jean Valjean's\nbed.\n\nJean Valjean looked at the walls, closed some of the cupboard doors, and\nwent and came from one room to another.\n\nThen he sought his own chamber once more, and set his candle on a table.\n\nHe had disengaged his arm from the sling, and he used his right hand as\nthough it did not hurt him.\n\nHe approached his bed, and his eyes rested, was it by chance? was it\nintentionally? on the inseparable of which Cosette had been jealous, on\nthe little portmanteau which never left him. On his arrival in the Rue\nde l'Homme Arme, on the 4th of June, he had deposited it on a round\ntable near the head of his bed. He went to this table with a sort of\nvivacity, took a key from his pocket, and opened the valise.\n\nFrom it he slowly drew forth the garments in which, ten years before,\nCosette had quitted Montfermeil; first the little gown, then the black\nfichu, then the stout, coarse child's shoes which Cosette might almost\nhave worn still, so tiny were her feet, then the fustian bodice, which\nwas very thick, then the knitted petticoat, next the apron with pockets,\nthen the woollen stockings. These stockings, which still preserved the\ngraceful form of a tiny leg, were no longer than Jean Valjean's hand.\nAll this was black of hue. It was he who had brought those garments to\nMontfermeil for her. As he removed them from the valise, he laid them on\nthe bed. He fell to thinking. He called up memories. It was in winter,\nin a very cold month of December, she was shivering, half-naked, in\nrags, her poor little feet were all red in their wooden shoes. He, Jean\nValjean, had made her abandon those rags to clothe herself in these\nmourning habiliments. The mother must have felt pleased in her grave, to\nsee her daughter wearing mourning for her, and, above all, to see that\nshe was properly clothed, and that she was warm. He thought of that\nforest of Montfermeil; they had traversed it together, Cosette and he;\nhe thought of what the weather had been, of the leafless trees, of the\nwood destitute of birds, of the sunless sky; it mattered not, it was\ncharming. He arranged the tiny garments on the bed, the fichu next to\nthe petticoat, the stockings beside the shoes, and he looked at them,\none after the other. She was no taller than that, she had her big doll\nin her arms, she had put her louis d'or in the pocket of that apron, she\nhad laughed, they walked hand in hand, she had no one in the world but\nhim.\n\nThen his venerable, white head fell forward on the bed, that stoical old\nheart broke, his face was engulfed, so to speak, in Cosette's garments,\nand if any one had passed up the stairs at that moment, he would have\nheard frightful sobs.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV--THE IMMORTAL LIVER [68]\n\nThe old and formidable struggle, of which we have already witnessed so\nmany phases, began once more.\n\nJacob struggled with the angel but one night. Alas! how many times have\nwe beheld Jean Valjean seized bodily by his conscience, in the darkness,\nand struggling desperately against it!\n\nUnheard-of conflict! At certain moments the foot slips; at other moments\nthe ground crumbles away underfoot. How many times had that conscience,\nmad for the good, clasped and overthrown him! How many times had the\ntruth set her knee inexorably upon his breast! How many times, hurled\nto earth by the light, had he begged for mercy! How many times had\nthat implacable spark, lighted within him, and upon him by the Bishop,\ndazzled him by force when he had wished to be blind! How many times\nhad he risen to his feet in the combat, held fast to the rock, leaning\nagainst sophism, dragged in the dust, now getting the upper hand of his\nconscience, again overthrown by it! How many times, after an equivoque,\nafter the specious and treacherous reasoning of egotism, had he heard\nhis irritated conscience cry in his ear: \"A trip! you wretch!\" How many\ntimes had his refractory thoughts rattled convulsively in his throat,\nunder the evidence of duty! Resistance to God. Funereal sweats. What\nsecret wounds which he alone felt bleed! What excoriations in his\nlamentable existence! How many times he had risen bleeding, bruised,\nbroken, enlightened, despair in his heart, serenity in his soul!\nand, vanquished, he had felt himself the conqueror. And, after having\ndislocated, broken, and rent his conscience with red-hot pincers, it had\nsaid to him, as it stood over him, formidable, luminous, and tranquil:\n\"Now, go in peace!\"\n\nBut on emerging from so melancholy a conflict, what a lugubrious peace,\nalas!\n\nNevertheless, that night Jean Valjean felt that he was passing through\nhis final combat.\n\nA heart-rending question presented itself.\n\nPredestinations are not all direct; they do not open out in a straight\navenue before the predestined man; they have blind courts, impassable\nalleys, obscure turns, disturbing crossroads offering the choice of many\nways. Jean Valjean had halted at that moment at the most perilous of\nthese crossroads.\n\nHe had come to the supreme crossing of good and evil. He had that\ngloomy intersection beneath his eyes. On this occasion once more, as had\nhappened to him already in other sad vicissitudes, two roads opened out\nbefore him, the one tempting, the other alarming.\n\nWhich was he to take?\n\nHe was counselled to the one which alarmed him by that mysterious index\nfinger which we all perceive whenever we fix our eyes on the darkness.\n\nOnce more, Jean Valjean had the choice between the terrible port and the\nsmiling ambush.\n\nIs it then true? the soul may recover; but not fate. Frightful thing! an\nincurable destiny!\n\nThis is the problem which presented itself to him:\n\nIn what manner was Jean Valjean to behave in relation to the happiness\nof Cosette and Marius? It was he who had willed that happiness, it was\nhe who had brought it about; he had, himself, buried it in his entrails,\nand at that moment, when he reflected on it, he was able to enjoy the\nsort of satisfaction which an armorer would experience on recognizing\nhis factory mark on a knife, on withdrawing it, all smoking, from his\nown breast.\n\nCosette had Marius, Marius possessed Cosette. They had everything, even\nriches. And this was his doing.\n\nBut what was he, Jean Valjean, to do with this happiness, now that\nit existed, now that it was there? Should he force himself on this\nhappiness? Should he treat it as belonging to him? No doubt, Cosette did\nbelong to another; but should he, Jean Valjean, retain of Cosette all\nthat he could retain? Should he remain the sort of father, half seen but\nrespected, which he had hitherto been? Should he, without saying a\nword, bring his past to that future? Should he present himself there,\nas though he had a right, and should he seat himself, veiled, at that\nluminous fireside? Should he take those innocent hands into his tragic\nhands, with a smile? Should he place upon the peaceful fender of the\nGillenormand drawing-room those feet of his, which dragged behind them\nthe disgraceful shadow of the law? Should he enter into participation in\nthe fair fortunes of Cosette and Marius? Should he render the obscurity\non his brow and the cloud upon theirs still more dense? Should he\nplace his catastrophe as a third associate in their felicity? Should he\ncontinue to hold his peace? In a word, should he be the sinister mute of\ndestiny beside these two happy beings?\n\nWe must have become habituated to fatality and to encounters with it, in\norder to have the daring to raise our eyes when certain questions appear\nto us in all their horrible nakedness. Good or evil stands behind\nthis severe interrogation point. What are you going to do? demands the\nsphinx.\n\nThis habit of trial Jean Valjean possessed. He gazed intently at the\nsphinx.\n\nHe examined the pitiless problem under all its aspects.\n\nCosette, that charming existence, was the raft of this shipwreck. What\nwas he to do? To cling fast to it, or to let go his hold?\n\nIf he clung to it, he should emerge from disaster, he should ascend\nagain into the sunlight, he should let the bitter water drip from his\ngarments and his hair, he was saved, he should live.\n\nAnd if he let go his hold?\n\nThen the abyss.\n\nThus he took sad council with his thoughts. Or, to speak more correctly,\nhe fought; he kicked furiously internally, now against his will, now\nagainst his conviction.\n\nHappily for Jean Valjean that he had been able to weep. That relieved\nhim, possibly. But the beginning was savage. A tempest, more furious\nthan the one which had formerly driven him to Arras, broke loose within\nhim. The past surged up before him facing the present; he compared\nthem and sobbed. The silence of tears once opened, the despairing man\nwrithed.\n\nHe felt that he had been stopped short.\n\nAlas! in this fight to the death between our egotism and our duty, when\nwe thus retreat step by step before our immutable ideal, bewildered,\nfurious, exasperated at having to yield, disputing the ground, hoping\nfor a possible flight, seeking an escape, what an abrupt and sinister\nresistance does the foot of the wall offer in our rear!\n\nTo feel the sacred shadow which forms an obstacle!\n\nThe invisible inexorable, what an obsession!\n\nThen, one is never done with conscience. Make your choice, Brutus; make\nyour choice, Cato. It is fathomless, since it is God. One flings into\nthat well the labor of one's whole life, one flings in one's fortune,\none flings in one's riches, one flings in one's success, one flings in\none's liberty or fatherland, one flings in one's well-being, one flings\nin one's repose, one flings in one's joy! More! more! more! Empty the\nvase! tip the urn! One must finish by flinging in one's heart.\n\nSomewhere in the fog of the ancient hells, there is a tun like that.\n\nIs not one pardonable, if one at last refuses! Can the inexhaustible\nhave any right? Are not chains which are endless above human strength?\nWho would blame Sisyphus and Jean Valjean for saying: \"It is enough!\"\n\nThe obedience of matter is limited by friction; is there no limit to the\nobedience of the soul? If perpetual motion is impossible, can perpetual\nself-sacrifice be exacted?\n\nThe first step is nothing, it is the last which is difficult. What was\nthe Champmathieu affair in comparison with Cosette's marriage and of\nthat which it entailed? What is a re-entrance into the galleys, compared\nto entrance into the void?\n\nOh, first step that must be descended, how sombre art thou! Oh, second\nstep, how black art thou!\n\nHow could he refrain from turning aside his head this time?\n\nMartyrdom is sublimation, corrosive sublimation. It is a torture which\nconsecrates. One can consent to it for the first hour; one seats oneself\non the throne of glowing iron, one places on one's head the crown of hot\niron, one accepts the globe of red hot iron, one takes the sceptre of\nred hot iron, but the mantle of flame still remains to be donned, and\ncomes there not a moment when the miserable flesh revolts and when one\nabdicates from suffering?\n\nAt length, Jean Valjean entered into the peace of exhaustion.\n\nHe weighed, he reflected, he considered the alternatives, the mysterious\nbalance of light and darkness.\n\nShould he impose his galleys on those two dazzling children, or should\nhe consummate his irremediable engulfment by himself? On one side lay\nthe sacrifice of Cosette, on the other that of himself.\n\nAt what solution should he arrive? What decision did he come to?\n\nWhat resolution did he take? What was his own inward definitive response\nto the unbribable interrogatory of fatality? What door did he decide to\nopen? Which side of his life did he resolve upon closing and condemning?\nAmong all the unfathomable precipices which surrounded him, which was\nhis choice? What extremity did he accept? To which of the gulfs did he\nnod his head?\n\nHis dizzy revery lasted all night long.\n\nHe remained there until daylight, in the same attitude, bent double over\nthat bed, prostrate beneath the enormity of fate, crushed, perchance,\nalas! with clenched fists, with arms outspread at right angles, like a\nman crucified who has been un-nailed, and flung face down on the earth.\nThere he remained for twelve hours, the twelve long hours of a long\nwinter's night, ice-cold, without once raising his head, and without\nuttering a word. He was as motionless as a corpse, while his thoughts\nwallowed on the earth and soared, now like the hydra, now like the\neagle. Any one to behold him thus motionless would have pronounced him\ndead; all at once he shuddered convulsively, and his mouth, glued to\nCosette's garments, kissed them; then it could be seen that he was\nalive.\n\nWho could see? Since Jean Valjean was alone, and there was no one there.\n\nThe One who is in the shadows.\n\n\n\n\nBOOK SEVENTH.--THE LAST DRAUGHT FROM THE CUP\n\n[Illustration: Last Drop from the Cup  5b7-1-last-drop]\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I--THE SEVENTH CIRCLE AND THE EIGHTH HEAVEN\n\nThe days that follow weddings are solitary. People respect the\nmeditations of the happy pair. And also, their tardy slumbers, to some\ndegree. The tumult of visits and congratulations only begins later on.\nOn the morning of the 17th of February, it was a little past midday when\nBasque, with napkin and feather-duster under his arm, busy in setting\nhis antechamber to rights, heard a light tap at the door. There had been\nno ring, which was discreet on such a day. Basque opened the door, and\nbeheld M. Fauchelevent. He introduced him into the drawing-room, still\nencumbered and topsy-turvy, and which bore the air of a field of battle\nafter the joys of the preceding evening.\n\n\"Dame, sir,\" remarked Basque, \"we all woke up late.\"\n\n\"Is your master up?\" asked Jean Valjean.\n\n\"How is Monsieur's arm?\" replied Basque.\n\n\"Better. Is your master up?\"\n\n\"Which one? the old one or the new one?\"\n\n\"Monsieur Pontmercy.\"\n\n\"Monsieur le Baron,\" said Basque, drawing himself up.\n\nA man is a Baron most of all to his servants. He counts for something\nwith them; they are what a philosopher would call, bespattered with the\ntitle, and that flatters them. Marius, be it said in passing, a militant\nrepublican as he had proved, was now a Baron in spite of himself. A\nsmall revolution had taken place in the family in connection with\nthis title. It was now M. Gillenormand who clung to it, and Marius who\ndetached himself from it. But Colonel Pontmercy had written: \"My son\nwill bear my title.\" Marius obeyed. And then, Cosette, in whom the woman\nwas beginning to dawn, was delighted to be a Baroness.\n\n\"Monsieur le Baron?\" repeated Basque. \"I will go and see. I will tell\nhim that M. Fauchelevent is here.\"\n\n\"No. Do not tell him that it is I. Tell him that some one wishes to\nspeak to him in private, and mention no name.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" ejaculated Basque.\n\n\"I wish to surprise him.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" ejaculated Basque once more, emitting his second \"ah!\" as an\nexplanation of the first.\n\nAnd he left the room.\n\nJean Valjean remained alone.\n\nThe drawing-room, as we have just said, was in great disorder. It seemed\nas though, by lending an air, one might still hear the vague noise of\nthe wedding. On the polished floor lay all sorts of flowers which\nhad fallen from garlands and head-dresses. The wax candles, burned\nto stumps, added stalactites of wax to the crystal drops of the\nchandeliers. Not a single piece of furniture was in its place. In the\ncorners, three or four arm-chairs, drawn close together in a circle,\nhad the appearance of continuing a conversation. The whole effect was\ncheerful. A certain grace still lingers round a dead feast. It has been\na happy thing. On the chairs in disarray, among those fading flowers,\nbeneath those extinct lights, people have thought of joy. The sun\nhad succeeded to the chandelier, and made its way gayly into the\ndrawing-room.\n\nSeveral minutes elapsed. Jean Valjean stood motionless on the spot where\nBasque had left him. He was very pale. His eyes were hollow, and so\nsunken in his head by sleeplessness that they nearly disappeared in\ntheir orbits. His black coat bore the weary folds of a garment that\nhas been up all night. The elbows were whitened with the down which the\nfriction of cloth against linen leaves behind it.\n\nJean Valjean stared at the window outlined on the polished floor at his\nfeet by the sun.\n\nThere came a sound at the door, and he raised his eyes.\n\nMarius entered, his head well up, his mouth smiling, an indescribable\nlight on his countenance, his brow expanded, his eyes triumphant. He had\nnot slept either.\n\n\"It is you, father!\" he exclaimed, on catching sight of Jean Valjean;\n\"that idiot of a Basque had such a mysterious air! But you have come too\nearly. It is only half past twelve. Cosette is asleep.\"\n\nThat word: \"Father,\" said to M. Fauchelevent by Marius, signified:\nsupreme felicity. There had always existed, as the reader knows, a lofty\nwall, a coldness and a constraint between them; ice which must be broken\nor melted. Marius had reached that point of intoxication when the wall\nwas lowered, when the ice dissolved, and when M. Fauchelevent was to\nhim, as to Cosette, a father.\n\nHe continued: his words poured forth, as is the peculiarity of divine\nparoxysms of joy.\n\n\"How glad I am to see you! If you only knew how we missed you yesterday!\nGood morning, father. How is your hand? Better, is it not?\"\n\nAnd, satisfied with the favorable reply which he had made to himself, he\npursued:\n\n\"We have both been talking about you. Cosette loves you so dearly! You\nmust not forget that you have a chamber here, We want nothing more to\ndo with the Rue de l'Homme Arme. We will have no more of it at all. How\ncould you go to live in a street like that, which is sickly, which is\ndisagreeable, which is ugly, which has a barrier at one end, where one\nis cold, and into which one cannot enter? You are to come and install\nyourself here. And this very day. Or you will have to deal with Cosette.\nShe means to lead us all by the nose, I warn you. You have your own\nchamber here, it is close to ours, it opens on the garden; the trouble\nwith the clock has been attended to, the bed is made, it is all ready,\nyou have only to take possession of it. Near your bed Cosette has placed\na huge, old, easy-chair covered with Utrecht velvet and she has said to\nit: 'Stretch out your arms to him.' A nightingale comes to the clump of\nacacias opposite your windows, every spring. In two months more you will\nhave it. You will have its nest on your left and ours on your right. By\nnight it will sing, and by day Cosette will prattle. Your chamber faces\ndue South. Cosette will arrange your books for you, your Voyages of\nCaptain Cook and the other,--Vancouver's and all your affairs. I believe\nthat there is a little valise to which you are attached, I have fixed\nupon a corner of honor for that. You have conquered my grandfather, you\nsuit him. We will live together. Do you play whist? you will overwhelm\nmy grandfather with delight if you play whist. It is you who shall take\nCosette to walk on the days when I am at the courts, you shall give her\nyour arm, you know, as you used to, in the Luxembourg. We are absolutely\nresolved to be happy. And you shall be included in it, in our happiness,\ndo you hear, father? Come, will you breakfast with us to-day?\"\n\n\"Sir,\" said Jean Valjean, \"I have something to say to you. I am an\nex-convict.\"\n\nThe limit of shrill sounds perceptible can be overleaped, as well in\nthe case of the mind as in that of the ear. These words: \"I am an\nex-convict,\" proceeding from the mouth of M. Fauchelevent and entering\nthe ear of Marius overshot the possible. It seemed to him that something\nhad just been said to him; but he did not know what. He stood with his\nmouth wide open.\n\nThen he perceived that the man who was addressing him was frightful.\nWholly absorbed in his own dazzled state, he had not, up to that moment,\nobserved the other man's terrible pallor.\n\nJean Valjean untied the black cravat which supported his right arm,\nunrolled the linen from around his hand, bared his thumb and showed it\nto Marius.\n\n\"There is nothing the matter with my hand,\" said he.\n\nMarius looked at the thumb.\n\n\"There has not been anything the matter with it,\" went on Jean Valjean.\n\nThere was, in fact, no trace of any injury.\n\nJean Valjean continued:\n\n\"It was fitting that I should be absent from your marriage. I absented\nmyself as much as was in my power. So I invented this injury in order\nthat I might not commit a forgery, that I might not introduce a flaw\ninto the marriage documents, in order that I might escape from signing.\"\n\nMarius stammered.\n\n\"What is the meaning of this?\"\n\n\"The meaning of it is,\" replied Jean Valjean, \"that I have been in the\ngalleys.\"\n\n\"You are driving me mad!\" exclaimed Marius in terror.\n\n\"Monsieur Pontmercy,\" said Jean Valjean, \"I was nineteen years in the\ngalleys. For theft. Then, I was condemned for life for theft, for a\nsecond offence. At the present moment, I have broken my ban.\"\n\nIn vain did Marius recoil before the reality, refuse the fact, resist\nthe evidence, he was forced to give way. He began to understand, and, as\nalways happens in such cases, he understood too much. An inward shudder\nof hideous enlightenment flashed through him; an idea which made him\nquiver traversed his mind. He caught a glimpse of a wretched destiny for\nhimself in the future.\n\n\"Say all, say all!\" he cried. \"You are Cosette's father!\"\n\nAnd he retreated a couple of paces with a movement of indescribable\nhorror.\n\nJean Valjean elevated his head with so much majesty of attitude that he\nseemed to grow even to the ceiling.\n\n\"It is necessary that you should believe me here, sir; although our oath\nto others may not be received in law . . .\"\n\nHere he paused, then, with a sort of sovereign and sepulchral authority,\nhe added, articulating slowly, and emphasizing the syllables:\n\n\". . . You will believe me. I the father of Cosette! before God, no.\nMonsieur le Baron Pontmercy, I am a peasant of Faverolles. I earned my\nliving by pruning trees. My name is not Fauchelevent, but Jean Valjean.\nI am not related to Cosette. Reassure yourself.\"\n\nMarius stammered:\n\n\"Who will prove that to me?\"\n\n\"I. Since I tell you so.\"\n\nMarius looked at the man. He was melancholy yet tranquil. No lie could\nproceed from such a calm. That which is icy is sincere. The truth could\nbe felt in that chill of the tomb.\n\n\"I believe you,\" said Marius.\n\nJean Valjean bent his head, as though taking note of this, and\ncontinued:\n\n\"What am I to Cosette? A passer-by. Ten years ago, I did not know that\nshe was in existence. I love her, it is true. One loves a child whom one\nhas seen when very young, being old oneself. When one is old, one feels\noneself a grandfather towards all little children. You may, it seems to\nme, suppose that I have something which resembles a heart. She was an\norphan. Without either father or mother. She needed me. That is why I\nbegan to love her. Children are so weak that the first comer, even a man\nlike me, can become their protector. I have fulfilled this duty towards\nCosette. I do not think that so slight a thing can be called a good\naction; but if it be a good action, well, say that I have done it.\nRegister this attenuating circumstance. To-day, Cosette passes out of my\nlife; our two roads part. Henceforth, I can do nothing for her. She is\nMadame Pontmercy. Her providence has changed. And Cosette gains by the\nchange. All is well. As for the six hundred thousand francs, you do not\nmention them to me, but I forestall your thought, they are a deposit.\nHow did that deposit come into my hands? What does that matter? I\nrestore the deposit. Nothing more can be demanded of me. I complete\nthe restitution by announcing my true name. That concerns me. I have a\nreason for desiring that you should know who I am.\"\n\nAnd Jean Valjean looked Marius full in the face.\n\nAll that Marius experienced was tumultuous and incoherent. Certain gusts\nof destiny produce these billows in our souls.\n\nWe have all undergone moments of trouble in which everything within us\nis dispersed; we say the first things that occur to us, which are\nnot always precisely those which should be said. There are sudden\nrevelations which one cannot bear, and which intoxicate like baleful\nwine. Marius was stupefied by the novel situation which presented itself\nto him, to the point of addressing that man almost like a person who was\nangry with him for this avowal.\n\n\"But why,\" he exclaimed, \"do you tell me all this? Who forces you to\ndo so? You could have kept your secret to yourself. You are neither\ndenounced, nor tracked nor pursued. You have a reason for wantonly\nmaking such a revelation. Conclude. There is something more. In what\nconnection do you make this confession? What is your motive?\"\n\n\"My motive?\" replied Jean Valjean in a voice so low and dull that one\nwould have said that he was talking to himself rather than to Marius.\n\"From what motive, in fact, has this convict just said 'I am a convict'?\nWell, yes! the motive is strange. It is out of honesty. Stay, the\nunfortunate point is that I have a thread in my heart, which keeps me\nfast. It is when one is old that that sort of thread is particularly\nsolid. All life falls in ruin around one; one resists. Had I been able\nto tear out that thread, to break it, to undo the knot or to cut it, to\ngo far away, I should have been safe. I had only to go away; there are\ndiligences in the Rue Bouloy; you are happy; I am going. I have tried\nto break that thread, I have jerked at it, it would not break, I tore my\nheart with it. Then I said: 'I cannot live anywhere else than here.' I\nmust stay. Well, yes, you are right, I am a fool, why not simply\nremain here? You offer me a chamber in this house, Madame Pontmercy is\nsincerely attached to me, she said to the arm-chair: 'Stretch out your\narms to him,' your grandfather demands nothing better than to have me, I\nsuit him, we shall live together, and take our meals in common, I shall\ngive Cosette my arm . . . Madame Pontmercy, excuse me, it is a habit, we\nshall have but one roof, one table, one fire, the same chimney-corner\nin winter, the same promenade in summer, that is joy, that is happiness,\nthat is everything. We shall live as one family. One family!\"\n\nAt that word, Jean Valjean became wild. He folded his arms, glared at\nthe floor beneath his feet as though he would have excavated an abyss\ntherein, and his voice suddenly rose in thundering tones:\n\n\"As one family! No. I belong to no family. I do not belong to yours.\nI do not belong to any family of men. In houses where people are among\nthemselves, I am superfluous. There are families, but there is nothing\nof the sort for me. I am an unlucky wretch; I am left outside. Did I\nhave a father and mother? I almost doubt it. On the day when I gave that\nchild in marriage, all came to an end. I have seen her happy, and that\nshe is with a man whom she loves, and that there exists here a kind old\nman, a household of two angels, and all joys in that house, and that it\nwas well, I said to myself: 'Enter thou not.' I could have lied, it is\ntrue, have deceived you all, and remained Monsieur Fauchelevent. So long\nas it was for her, I could lie; but now it would be for myself, and I\nmust not. It was sufficient for me to hold my peace, it is true, and all\nwould go on. You ask me what has forced me to speak? a very odd thing;\nmy conscience. To hold my peace was very easy, however. I passed the\nnight in trying to persuade myself to it; you questioned me, and what I\nhave just said to you is so extraordinary that you have the right to do\nit; well, yes, I have passed the night in alleging reasons to myself,\nand I gave myself very good reasons, I have done what I could. But there\nare two things in which I have not succeeded; in breaking the thread\nthat holds me fixed, riveted and sealed here by the heart, or in\nsilencing some one who speaks softly to me when I am alone. That is why\nI have come hither to tell you everything this morning. Everything or\nnearly everything. It is useless to tell you that which concerns only\nmyself; I keep that to myself. You know the essential points. So I have\ntaken my mystery and have brought it to you. And I have disembowelled my\nsecret before your eyes. It was not a resolution that was easy to take.\nI struggled all night long. Ah! you think that I did not tell myself\nthat this was no Champmathieu affair, that by concealing my name I was\ndoing no one any injury, that the name of Fauchelevent had been given to\nme by Fauchelevent himself, out of gratitude for a service rendered to\nhim, and that I might assuredly keep it, and that I should be happy in\nthat chamber which you offer me, that I should not be in any one's way,\nthat I should be in my own little corner, and that, while you would have\nCosette, I should have the idea that I was in the same house with her.\nEach one of us would have had his share of happiness. If I continued to\nbe Monsieur Fauchelevent, that would arrange everything. Yes, with the\nexception of my soul. There was joy everywhere upon my surface, but the\nbottom of my soul remained black. It is not enough to be happy, one must\nbe content. Thus I should have remained Monsieur Fauchelevent, thus\nI should have concealed my true visage, thus, in the presence of your\nexpansion, I should have had an enigma, thus, in the midst of your full\nnoonday, I should have had shadows, thus, without crying ''ware,' I\nshould have simply introduced the galleys to your fireside, I should\nhave taken my seat at your table with the thought that if you knew who\nI was, you would drive me from it, I should have allowed myself to\nbe served by domestics who, had they known, would have said: 'How\nhorrible!' I should have touched you with my elbow, which you have a\nright to dislike, I should have filched your clasps of the hand! There\nwould have existed in your house a division of respect between venerable\nwhite locks and tainted white locks; at your most intimate hours, when\nall hearts thought themselves open to the very bottom to all the rest,\nwhen we four were together, your grandfather, you two and myself, a\nstranger would have been present! I should have been side by side with\nyou in your existence, having for my only care not to disarrange the\ncover of my dreadful pit. Thus, I, a dead man, should have thrust myself\nupon you who are living beings. I should have condemned her to myself\nforever. You and Cosette and I would have had all three of our heads in\nthe green cap! Does it not make you shudder? I am only the most crushed\nof men; I should have been the most monstrous of men. And I should have\ncommitted that crime every day! And I should have had that face of night\nupon my visage every day! every day! And I should have communicated to\nyou a share in my taint every day! every day! to you, my dearly beloved,\nmy children, to you, my innocent creatures! Is it nothing to hold one's\npeace? is it a simple matter to keep silence? No, it is not simple.\nThere is a silence which lies. And my lie, and my fraud and my\nindignity, and my cowardice and my treason and my crime, I should have\ndrained drop by drop, I should have spit it out, then swallowed it\nagain, I should have finished at midnight and have begun again at\nmidday, and my 'good morning' would have lied, and my 'good night' would\nhave lied, and I should have slept on it, I should have eaten it, with\nmy bread, and I should have looked Cosette in the face, and I should\nhave responded to the smile of the angel by the smile of the damned\nsoul, and I should have been an abominable villain! Why should I do\nit? in order to be happy. In order to be happy. Have I the right to be\nhappy? I stand outside of life, Sir.\"\n\nJean Valjean paused. Marius listened. Such chains of ideas and of\nanguishes cannot be interrupted. Jean Valjean lowered his voice once\nmore, but it was no longer a dull voice--it was a sinister voice.\n\n\"You ask why I speak? I am neither denounced, nor pursued, nor tracked,\nyou say. Yes! I am denounced! yes! I am tracked! By whom? By myself.\nIt is I who bar the passage to myself, and I drag myself, and I push\nmyself, and I arrest myself, and I execute myself, and when one holds\noneself, one is firmly held.\"\n\nAnd, seizing a handful of his own coat by the nape of the neck and\nextending it towards Marius:\n\n\"Do you see that fist?\" he continued. \"Don't you think that it holds\nthat collar in such a wise as not to release it? Well! conscience\nis another grasp! If one desires to be happy, sir, one must never\nunderstand duty; for, as soon as one has comprehended it, it is\nimplacable. One would say that it punished you for comprehending it;\nbut no, it rewards you; for it places you in a hell, where you feel God\nbeside you. One has no sooner lacerated his own entrails than he is at\npeace with himself.\"\n\nAnd, with a poignant accent, he added:\n\n\"Monsieur Pontmercy, this is not common sense, I am an honest man. It is\nby degrading myself in your eyes that I elevate myself in my own. This\nhas happened to me once before, but it was less painful then; it was\na mere nothing. Yes, an honest man. I should not be so if, through my\nfault, you had continued to esteem me; now that you despise me, I am so.\nI have that fatality hanging over me that, not being able to ever have\nanything but stolen consideration, that consideration humiliates me,\nand crushes me inwardly, and, in order that I may respect myself, it is\nnecessary that I should be despised. Then I straighten up again. I am\na galley-slave who obeys his conscience. I know well that that is most\nimprobable. But what would you have me do about it? it is the fact.\nI have entered into engagements with myself; I keep them. There are\nencounters which bind us, there are chances which involve us in duties.\nYou see, Monsieur Pontmercy, various things have happened to me in the\ncourse of my life.\"\n\nAgain Jean Valjean paused, swallowing his saliva with an effort, as\nthough his words had a bitter after-taste, and then he went on:\n\n\"When one has such a horror hanging over one, one has not the right to\nmake others share it without their knowledge, one has not the right to\nmake them slip over one's own precipice without their perceiving it,\none has not the right to let one's red blouse drag upon them, one has no\nright to slyly encumber with one's misery the happiness of others. It is\nhideous to approach those who are healthy, and to touch them in the dark\nwith one's ulcer. In spite of the fact that Fauchelevent lent me his\nname, I have no right to use it; he could give it to me, but I could not\ntake it. A name is an _I_. You see, sir, that I have thought somewhat, I\nhave read a little, although I am a peasant; and you see that I\nexpress myself properly. I understand things. I have procured myself an\neducation. Well, yes, to abstract a name and to place oneself under it\nis dishonest. Letters of the alphabet can be filched, like a purse or a\nwatch. To be a false signature in flesh and blood, to be a living false\nkey, to enter the house of honest people by picking their lock, never\nmore to look straightforward, to forever eye askance, to be infamous\nwithin the _I_, no! no! no! no! no! It is better to suffer, to bleed, to\nweep, to tear one's skin from the flesh with one's nails, to pass nights\nwrithing in anguish, to devour oneself body and soul. That is why I have\njust told you all this. Wantonly, as you say.\"\n\nHe drew a painful breath, and hurled this final word:\n\n\"In days gone by, I stole a loaf of bread in order to live; to-day, in\norder to live, I will not steal a name.\"\n\n\"To live!\" interrupted Marius. \"You do not need that name in order to\nlive?\"\n\n\"Ah! I understand the matter,\" said Jean Valjean, raising and lowering\nhis head several times in succession.\n\nA silence ensued. Both held their peace, each plunged in a gulf of\nthoughts. Marius was sitting near a table and resting the corner of his\nmouth on one of his fingers, which was folded back. Jean Valjean was\npacing to and fro. He paused before a mirror, and remained motionless.\nThen, as though replying to some inward course of reasoning, he said, as\nhe gazed at the mirror, which he did not see:\n\n\"While, at present, I am relieved.\"\n\nHe took up his march again, and walked to the other end of the\ndrawing-room. At the moment when he turned round, he perceived that\nMarius was watching his walk. Then he said, with an inexpressible\nintonation:\n\n\"I drag my leg a little. Now you understand why!\"\n\nThen he turned fully round towards Marius:\n\n\"And now, sir, imagine this: I have said nothing, I have remained\nMonsieur Fauchelevent, I have taken my place in your house, I am one of\nyou, I am in my chamber, I come to breakfast in the morning in slippers,\nin the evening all three of us go to the play, I accompany Madame\nPontmercy to the Tuileries, and to the Place Royale, we are together,\nyou think me your equal; one fine day you are there, and I am there, we\nare conversing, we are laughing; all at once, you hear a voice shouting\nthis name: 'Jean Valjean!' and behold, that terrible hand, the police,\ndarts from the darkness, and abruptly tears off my mask!\"\n\nAgain he paused; Marius had sprung to his feet with a shudder. Jean\nValjean resumed:\n\n\"What do you say to that?\"\n\nMarius' silence answered for him.\n\nJean Valjean continued:\n\n\"You see that I am right in not holding my peace. Be happy, be\nin heaven, be the angel of an angel, exist in the sun, be content\ntherewith, and do not trouble yourself about the means which a poor\ndamned wretch takes to open his breast and force his duty to come forth;\nyou have before you, sir, a wretched man.\"\n\nMarius slowly crossed the room, and, when he was quite close to Jean\nValjean, he offered the latter his hand.\n\nBut Marius was obliged to step up and take that hand which was not\noffered, Jean Valjean let him have his own way, and it seemed to Marius\nthat he pressed a hand of marble.\n\n\"My grandfather has friends,\" said Marius; \"I will procure your pardon.\"\n\n\"It is useless,\" replied Jean Valjean. \"I am believed to be dead, and\nthat suffices. The dead are not subjected to surveillance. They are\nsupposed to rot in peace. Death is the same thing as pardon.\"\n\nAnd, disengaging the hand which Marius held, he added, with a sort of\ninexorable dignity:\n\n\"Moreover, the friend to whom I have recourse is the doing of my duty;\nand I need but one pardon, that of my conscience.\"\n\nAt that moment, a door at the other end of the drawing-room opened\ngently half way, and in the opening Cosette's head appeared. They saw\nonly her sweet face, her hair was in charming disorder, her eyelids were\nstill swollen with sleep. She made the movement of a bird, which thrusts\nits head out of its nest, glanced first at her husband, then at Jean\nValjean, and cried to them with a smile, so that they seemed to behold a\nsmile at the heart of a rose:\n\n\"I will wager that you are talking politics. How stupid that is, instead\nof being with me!\"\n\nJean Valjean shuddered.\n\n\"Cosette! . . .\" stammered Marius.\n\nAnd he paused. One would have said that they were two criminals.\n\nCosette, who was radiant, continued to gaze at both of them. There was\nsomething in her eyes like gleams of paradise.\n\n\"I have caught you in the very act,\" said Cosette. \"Just now, I heard my\nfather Fauchelevent through the door saying: 'Conscience . . . doing my\nduty . . .' That is politics, indeed it is. I will not have it. People\nshould not talk politics the very next day. It is not right.\"\n\n\"You are mistaken. Cosette,\" said Marius, \"we are talking business. We\nare discussing the best investment of your six hundred thousand\nfrancs . . .\"\n\n\"That is not it at all,\" interrupted Cosette. \"I am coming. Does any\nbody want me here?\"\n\nAnd, passing resolutely through the door, she entered the drawing-room.\nShe was dressed in a voluminous white dressing-gown, with a thousand\nfolds and large sleeves which, starting from the neck, fell to her feet.\nIn the golden heavens of some ancient gothic pictures, there are these\ncharming sacks fit to clothe the angels.\n\nShe contemplated herself from head to foot in a long mirror, then\nexclaimed, in an outburst of ineffable ecstasy:\n\n\"There was once a King and a Queen. Oh! how happy I am!\"\n\nThat said, she made a curtsey to Marius and to Jean Valjean.\n\n\"There,\" said she, \"I am going to install myself near you in an\neasy-chair, we breakfast in half an hour, you shall say anything you\nlike, I know well that men must talk, and I will be very good.\"\n\nMarius took her by the arm and said lovingly to her:\n\n\"We are talking business.\"\n\n\"By the way,\" said Cosette, \"I have opened my window, a flock of\npierrots has arrived in the garden,--Birds, not maskers. To-day is\nAsh-Wednesday; but not for the birds.\"\n\n\"I tell you that we are talking business, go, my little Cosette, leave\nus alone for a moment. We are talking figures. That will bore you.\"\n\n\"You have a charming cravat on this morning, Marius. You are very\ndandified, monseigneur. No, it will not bore me.\"\n\n\"I assure you that it will bore you.\"\n\n\"No. Since it is you. I shall not understand you, but I shall listen\nto you. When one hears the voices of those whom one loves, one does not\nneed to understand the words that they utter. That we should be here\ntogether--that is all that I desire. I shall remain with you, bah!\"\n\n\"You are my beloved Cosette! Impossible.\"\n\n\"Impossible!\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Very good,\" said Cosette. \"I was going to tell you some news. I could\nhave told you that your grandfather is still asleep, that your aunt is\nat mass, that the chimney in my father Fauchelevent's room smokes, that\nNicolette has sent for the chimney-sweep, that Toussaint and Nicolette\nhave already quarrelled, that Nicolette makes sport of Toussaint's\nstammer. Well, you shall know nothing. Ah! it is impossible? you shall\nsee, gentlemen, that I, in my turn, can say: It is impossible. Then who\nwill be caught? I beseech you, my little Marius, let me stay here with\nyou two.\"\n\n\"I swear to you, that it is indispensable that we should be alone.\"\n\n\"Well, am I anybody?\"\n\nJean Valjean had not uttered a single word. Cosette turned to him:\n\n\"In the first place, father, I want you to come and embrace me. What do\nyou mean by not saying anything instead of taking my part? who gave me\nsuch a father as that? You must perceive that my family life is very\nunhappy. My husband beats me. Come, embrace me instantly.\"\n\nJean Valjean approached.\n\nCosette turned toward Marius.\n\n\"As for you, I shall make a face at you.\"\n\nThen she presented her brow to Jean Valjean.\n\nJean Valjean advanced a step toward her.\n\nCosette recoiled.\n\n\"Father, you are pale. Does your arm hurt you?\"\n\n\"It is well,\" said Jean Valjean.\n\n\"Did you sleep badly?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Are you sad?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Embrace me if you are well, if you sleep well, if you are content, I\nwill not scold you.\"\n\nAnd again she offered him her brow.\n\nJean Valjean dropped a kiss upon that brow whereon rested a celestial\ngleam.\n\n\"Smile.\"\n\nJean Valjean obeyed. It was the smile of a spectre.\n\n\"Now, defend me against my husband.\"\n\n\"Cosette! . . .\" ejaculated Marius.\n\n\"Get angry, father. Say that I must stay. You can certainly talk before\nme. So you think me very silly. What you say is astonishing! business,\nplacing money in a bank a great matter truly. Men make mysteries out of\nnothing. I am very pretty this morning. Look at me, Marius.\"\n\nAnd with an adorable shrug of the shoulders, and an indescribably\nexquisite pout, she glanced at Marius.\n\n\"I love you!\" said Marius.\n\n\"I adore you!\" said Cosette.\n\nAnd they fell irresistibly into each other's arms.\n\n\"Now,\" said Cosette, adjusting a fold of her dressing-gown, with a\ntriumphant little grimace, \"I shall stay.\"\n\n\"No, not that,\" said Marius, in a supplicating tone. \"We have to finish\nsomething.\"\n\n\"Still no?\"\n\nMarius assumed a grave tone:\n\n\"I assure you, Cosette, that it is impossible.\"\n\n\"Ah! you put on your man's voice, sir. That is well, I go. You, father,\nhave not upheld me. Monsieur my father, monsieur my husband, you are\ntyrants. I shall go and tell grandpapa. If you think that I am going to\nreturn and talk platitudes to you, you are mistaken. I am proud. I shall\nwait for you now. You shall see, that it is you who are going to be\nbored without me. I am going, it is well.\"\n\nAnd she left the room.\n\nTwo seconds later, the door opened once more, her fresh and rosy head\nwas again thrust between the two leaves, and she cried to them:\n\n\"I am very angry indeed.\"\n\nThe door closed again, and the shadows descended once more.\n\nIt was as though a ray of sunlight should have suddenly traversed the\nnight, without itself being conscious of it.\n\nMarius made sure that the door was securely closed.\n\n\"Poor Cosette!\" he murmured, \"when she finds out . . .\"\n\nAt that word Jean Valjean trembled in every limb. He fixed on Marius a\nbewildered eye.\n\n\"Cosette! oh yes, it is true, you are going to tell Cosette about this.\nThat is right. Stay, I had not thought of that. One has the strength for\none thing, but not for another. Sir, I conjure you, I entreat now, sir,\ngive me your most sacred word of honor, that you will not tell her. Is\nit not enough that you should know it? I have been able to say it myself\nwithout being forced to it, I could have told it to the universe, to the\nwhole world,--it was all one to me. But she, she does not know what\nit is, it would terrify her. What, a convict! we should be obliged to\nexplain matters to her, to say to her: 'He is a man who has been in the\ngalleys.' She saw the chain-gang pass by one day. Oh! My God!\" . . . He\ndropped into an arm-chair and hid his face in his hands.\n\nHis grief was not audible, but from the quivering of his shoulders it\nwas evident that he was weeping. Silent tears, terrible tears.\n\nThere is something of suffocation in the sob. He was seized with a sort\nof convulsion, he threw himself against the back of the chair as though\nto gain breath, letting his arms fall, and allowing Marius to see his\nface inundated with tears, and Marius heard him murmur, so low that his\nvoice seemed to issue from fathomless depths:\n\n\"Oh! would that I could die!\"\n\n\"Be at your ease,\" said Marius, \"I will keep your secret for myself\nalone.\" And, less touched, perhaps, than he ought to have been, but\nforced, for the last hour, to familiarize himself with something\nas unexpected as it was dreadful, gradually beholding the convict\nsuperposed before his very eyes, upon M. Fauchelevent, overcome,\nlittle by little, by that lugubrious reality, and led, by the natural\ninclination of the situation, to recognize the space which had just been\nplaced between that man and himself, Marius added:\n\n\"It is impossible that I should not speak a word to you with regard to\nthe deposit which you have so faithfully and honestly remitted. That is\nan act of probity. It is just that some recompense should be bestowed on\nyou. Fix the sum yourself, it shall be counted out to you. Do not fear\nto set it very high.\"\n\n\"I thank you, sir,\" replied Jean Valjean, gently.\n\nHe remained in thought for a moment, mechanically passing the tip of his\nfore-finger across his thumb-nail, then he lifted up his voice:\n\n\"All is nearly over. But one last thing remains for me . . .\"\n\n\"What is it?\"\n\nJean Valjean struggled with what seemed a last hesitation, and, without\nvoice, without breath, he stammered rather than said:\n\n\"Now that you know, do you think, sir, you, who are the master, that I\nought not to see Cosette any more?\"\n\n\"I think that would be better,\" replied Marius coldly.\n\n\"I shall never see her more,\" murmured Jean Valjean. And he directed his\nsteps towards the door.\n\nHe laid his hand on the knob, the latch yielded, the door opened. Jean\nValjean pushed it open far enough to pass through, stood motionless for\na second, then closed the door again and turned to Marius.\n\nHe was no longer pale, he was livid. There were no longer any tears\nin his eyes, but only a sort of tragic flame. His voice had regained a\nstrange composure.\n\n\"Stay, sir,\" he said. \"If you will allow it, I will come to see her. I\nassure you that I desire it greatly. If I had not cared to see Cosette,\nI should not have made to you the confession that I have made, I should\nhave gone away; but, as I desired to remain in the place where Cosette\nis, and to continue to see her, I had to tell you about it honestly. You\nfollow my reasoning, do you not? it is a matter easily understood. You\nsee, I have had her with me for more than nine years. We lived first\nin that hut on the boulevard, then in the convent, then near the\nLuxembourg. That was where you saw her for the first time. You remember\nher blue plush hat. Then we went to the Quartier des Invalides, where\nthere was a railing on a garden, the Rue Plumet. I lived in a little\nback court-yard, whence I could hear her piano. That was my life. We\nnever left each other. That lasted for nine years and some months. I\nwas like her own father, and she was my child. I do not know whether\nyou understand, Monsieur Pontmercy, but to go away now, never to see her\nagain, never to speak to her again, to no longer have anything, would\nbe hard. If you do not disapprove of it, I will come to see Cosette from\ntime to time. I will not come often. I will not remain long. You shall\ngive orders that I am to be received in the little waiting-room. On the\nground floor. I could enter perfectly well by the back door, but that\nmight create surprise perhaps, and it would be better, I think, for me\nto enter by the usual door. Truly, sir, I should like to see a little\nmore of Cosette. As rarely as you please. Put yourself in my place,\nI have nothing left but that. And then, we must be cautious. If I\nno longer come at all, it would produce a bad effect, it would be\nconsidered singular. What I can do, by the way, is to come in the\nafternoon, when night is beginning to fall.\"\n\n\"You shall come every evening,\" said Marius, \"and Cosette will be\nwaiting for you.\"\n\n\"You are kind, sir,\" said Jean Valjean.\n\nMarius saluted Jean Valjean, happiness escorted despair to the door, and\nthese two men parted.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II--THE OBSCURITIES WHICH A REVELATION CAN CONTAIN\n\nMarius was quite upset.\n\nThe sort of estrangement which he had always felt towards the man beside\nwhom he had seen Cosette, was now explained to him. There was something\nenigmatic about that person, of which his instinct had warned him.\n\nThis enigma was the most hideous of disgraces, the galleys. This M.\nFauchelevent was the convict Jean Valjean.\n\nTo abruptly find such a secret in the midst of one's happiness resembles\nthe discovery of a scorpion in a nest of turtledoves.\n\nWas the happiness of Marius and Cosette thenceforth condemned to such a\nneighborhood? Was this an accomplished fact? Did the acceptance of that\nman form a part of the marriage now consummated? Was there nothing to be\ndone?\n\nHad Marius wedded the convict as well?\n\nIn vain may one be crowned with light and joy, in vain may one taste the\ngrand purple hour of life, happy love, such shocks would force even the\narchangel in his ecstasy, even the demigod in his glory, to shudder.\n\nAs is always the case in changes of view of this nature, Marius asked\nhimself whether he had nothing with which to reproach himself. Had he\nbeen wanting in divination? Had he been wanting in prudence? Had he\ninvoluntarily dulled his wits? A little, perhaps. Had he entered upon\nthis love affair, which had ended in his marriage to Cosette, without\ntaking sufficient precautions to throw light upon the surroundings? He\nadmitted,--it is thus, by a series of successive admissions of ourselves\nin regard to ourselves, that life amends us, little by little,--he\nadmitted the chimerical and visionary side of his nature, a sort of\ninternal cloud peculiar to many organizations, and which, in paroxysms\nof passion and sorrow, dilates as the temperature of the soul changes,\nand invades the entire man, to such a degree as to render him nothing\nmore than a conscience bathed in a mist. We have more than once\nindicated this characteristic element of Marius' individuality.\n\nHe recalled that, in the intoxication of his love, in the Rue Plumet,\nduring those six or seven ecstatic weeks, he had not even spoke to\nCosette of that drama in the Gorbeau hovel, where the victim had taken\nup such a singular line of silence during the struggle and the ensuing\nflight. How had it happened that he had not mentioned this to Cosette?\nYet it was so near and so terrible! How had it come to pass that he had\nnot even named the Thenardiers, and, particularly, on the day when he\nhad encountered Eponine? He now found it almost difficult to explain his\nsilence of that time. Nevertheless, he could account for it. He recalled\nhis benumbed state, his intoxication with Cosette, love absorbing\neverything, that catching away of each other into the ideal, and perhaps\nalso, like the imperceptible quantity of reason mingled with this\nviolent and charming state of the soul, a vague, dull instinct impelling\nhim to conceal and abolish in his memory that redoubtable adventure,\ncontact with which he dreaded, in which he did not wish to play any\npart, his agency in which he had kept secret, and in which he could be\nneither narrator nor witness without being an accuser.\n\nMoreover, these few weeks had been a flash of lightning; there had been\nno time for anything except love.\n\nIn short, having weighed everything, turned everything over in his mind,\nexamined everything, whatever might have been the consequences if he had\ntold Cosette about the Gorbeau ambush, even if he had discovered that\nJean Valjean was a convict, would that have changed him, Marius? Would\nthat have changed her, Cosette? Would he have drawn back? Would he have\nadored her any the less? Would he have refrained from marrying her? No.\nThen there was nothing to regret, nothing with which he need reproach\nhimself. All was well. There is a deity for those drunken men who are\ncalled lovers. Marius blind, had followed the path which he would have\nchosen had he been in full possession of his sight. Love had bandaged\nhis eyes, in order to lead him whither? To paradise.\n\nBut this paradise was henceforth complicated with an infernal\naccompaniment.\n\nMarius' ancient estrangement towards this man, towards this Fauchelevent\nwho had turned into Jean Valjean, was at present mingled with horror.\n\nIn this horror, let us state, there was some pity, and even a certain\nsurprise.\n\nThis thief, this thief guilty of a second offence, had restored that\ndeposit. And what a deposit! Six hundred thousand francs.\n\nHe alone was in the secret of that deposit. He might have kept it all,\nhe had restored it all.\n\nMoreover, he had himself revealed his situation. Nothing forced him to\nthis. If any one learned who he was, it was through himself. In this\navowal there was something more than acceptance of humiliation, there\nwas acceptance of peril. For a condemned man, a mask is not a mask, it\nis a shelter. A false name is security, and he had rejected that false\nname. He, the galley-slave, might have hidden himself forever in an\nhonest family; he had withstood this temptation. And with what motive?\nThrough a conscientious scruple. He himself explained this with the\nirresistible accents of truth. In short, whatever this Jean Valjean\nmight be, he was, undoubtedly, a conscience which was awakening. There\nexisted some mysterious re-habilitation which had begun; and, to all\nappearances, scruples had for a long time already controlled this man.\nSuch fits of justice and goodness are not characteristic of vulgar\nnatures. An awakening of conscience is grandeur of soul.\n\nJean Valjean was sincere. This sincerity, visible, palpable,\nirrefragable, evident from the very grief that it caused him, rendered\ninquiries useless, and conferred authority on all that that man had\nsaid.\n\nHere, for Marius, there was a strange reversal of situations. What\nbreathed from M. Fauchelevent? distrust. What did Jean Valjean inspire?\nconfidence.\n\nIn the mysterious balance of this Jean Valjean which the pensive Marius\nstruck, he admitted the active principle, he admitted the passive\nprinciple, and he tried to reach a balance.\n\nBut all this went on as in a storm. Marius, while endeavoring to form a\nclear idea of this man, and while pursuing Jean Valjean, so to speak, in\nthe depths of his thought, lost him and found him again in a fatal mist.\n\nThe deposit honestly restored, the probity of the confession--these were\ngood. This produced a lightening of the cloud, then the cloud became\nblack once more.\n\nTroubled as were Marius' memories, a shadow of them returned to him.\n\nAfter all, what was that adventure in the Jondrette attic? Why had that\nman taken to flight on the arrival of the police, instead of entering a\ncomplaint?\n\nHere Marius found the answer. Because that man was a fugitive from\njustice, who had broken his ban.\n\nAnother question: Why had that man come to the barricade?\n\nFor Marius now once more distinctly beheld that recollection which had\nre-appeared in his emotions like sympathetic ink at the application of\nheat. This man had been in the barricade. He had not fought there. What\nhad he come there for? In the presence of this question a spectre sprang\nup and replied: \"Javert.\"\n\nMarius recalled perfectly now that funereal sight of Jean Valjean\ndragging the pinioned Javert out of the barricade, and he still heard\nbehind the corner of the little Rue Mondetour that frightful pistol\nshot. Obviously, there was hatred between that police spy and the\ngalley-slave. The one was in the other's way. Jean Valjean had gone to\nthe barricade for the purpose of revenging himself. He had arrived late.\nHe probably knew that Javert was a prisoner there. The Corsican vendetta\nhas penetrated to certain lower strata and has become the law there; it\nis so simple that it does not astonish souls which are but half turned\ntowards good; and those hearts are so constituted that a criminal, who\nis in the path of repentance, may be scrupulous in the matter of theft\nand unscrupulous in the matter of vengeance. Jean Valjean had killed\nJavert. At least, that seemed to be evident.\n\nThis was the final question, to be sure; but to this there was no reply.\nThis question Marius felt like pincers. How had it come to pass that\nJean Valjean's existence had elbowed that of Cosette for so long a\nperiod?\n\nWhat melancholy sport of Providence was that which had placed that child\nin contact with that man? Are there then chains for two which are forged\non high? and does God take pleasure in coupling the angel with the\ndemon? So a crime and an innocence can be room-mates in the mysterious\ngalleys of wretchedness? In that defiling of condemned persons which\nis called human destiny, can two brows pass side by side, the one\ningenuous, the other formidable, the one all bathed in the divine\nwhiteness of dawn, the other forever blemished by the flash of an\neternal lightning? Who could have arranged that inexplicable pairing\noff? In what manner, in consequence of what prodigy, had any community\nof life been established between this celestial little creature and that\nold criminal?\n\nWho could have bound the lamb to the wolf, and, what was still more\nincomprehensible, have attached the wolf to the lamb? For the wolf loved\nthe lamb, for the fierce creature adored the feeble one, for, during\nthe space of nine years, the angel had had the monster as her point of\nsupport. Cosette's childhood and girlhood, her advent in the daylight,\nher virginal growth towards life and light, had been sheltered by\nthat hideous devotion. Here questions exfoliated, so to speak, into\ninnumerable enigmas, abysses yawned at the bottoms of abysses, and\nMarius could no longer bend over Jean Valjean without becoming dizzy.\nWhat was this man-precipice?\n\nThe old symbols of Genesis are eternal; in human society, such as it now\nexists, and until a broader day shall effect a change in it, there will\nalways be two men, the one superior, the other subterranean; the one\nwhich is according to good is Abel; the other which is according to evil\nis Cain. What was this tender Cain? What was this ruffian religiously\nabsorbed in the adoration of a virgin, watching over her, rearing her,\nguarding her, dignifying her, and enveloping her, impure as he was\nhimself, with purity?\n\nWhat was that cess-pool which had venerated that innocence to such a\npoint as not to leave upon it a single spot? What was this Jean Valjean\neducating Cosette? What was this figure of the shadows which had for its\nonly object the preservation of the rising of a star from every shadow\nand from every cloud?\n\nThat was Jean Valjean's secret; that was also God's secret.\n\nIn the presence of this double secret, Marius recoiled. The one, in some\nsort, reassured him as to the other. God was as visible in this affair\nas was Jean Valjean. God has his instruments. He makes use of the tool\nwhich he wills. He is not responsible to men. Do we know how God sets\nabout the work? Jean Valjean had labored over Cosette. He had, to some\nextent, made that soul. That was incontestable. Well, what then? The\nworkman was horrible; but the work was admirable. God produces his\nmiracles as seems good to him. He had constructed that charming Cosette,\nand he had employed Jean Valjean. It had pleased him to choose this\nstrange collaborator for himself. What account have we to demand of him?\nIs this the first time that the dung-heap has aided the spring to create\nthe rose?\n\nMarius made himself these replies, and declared to himself that they\nwere good. He had not dared to press Jean Valjean on all the points\nwhich we have just indicated, but he did not confess to himself that he\ndid not dare to do it. He adored Cosette, he possessed Cosette, Cosette\nwas splendidly pure. That was sufficient for him. What enlightenment did\nhe need? Cosette was a light. Does light require enlightenment? He had\neverything; what more could he desire? All,--is not that enough? Jean\nValjean's personal affairs did not concern him.\n\nAnd bending over the fatal shadow of that man, he clung fast,\nconvulsively, to the solemn declaration of that unhappy wretch: \"I\nam nothing to Cosette. Ten years ago I did not know that she was in\nexistence.\"\n\nJean Valjean was a passer-by. He had said so himself. Well, he had\npassed. Whatever he was, his part was finished.\n\nHenceforth, there remained Marius to fulfil the part of Providence to\nCosette. Cosette had sought the azure in a person like herself, in her\nlover, her husband, her celestial male. Cosette, as she took her flight,\nwinged and transfigured, left behind her on the earth her hideous and\nempty chrysalis, Jean Valjean.\n\nIn whatever circle of ideas Marius revolved, he always returned to a\ncertain horror for Jean Valjean. A sacred horror, perhaps, for, as we\nhave just pointed out, he felt a quid divinum in that man. But do what\nhe would, and seek what extenuation he would, he was certainly forced to\nfall back upon this: the man was a convict; that is to say, a being who\nhas not even a place in the social ladder, since he is lower than the\nvery lowest rung. After the very last of men comes the convict. The\nconvict is no longer, so to speak, in the semblance of the living. The\nlaw has deprived him of the entire quantity of humanity of which it can\ndeprive a man.\n\nMarius, on penal questions, still held to the inexorable system, though\nhe was a democrat and he entertained all the ideas of the law on the\nsubject of those whom the law strikes. He had not yet accomplished all\nprogress, we admit. He had not yet come to distinguish between that\nwhich is written by man and that which is written by God, between law\nand right. He had not examined and weighed the right which man takes to\ndispose of the irrevocable and the irreparable. He was not shocked by\nthe word vindicte. He found it quite simple that certain breaches of the\nwritten law should be followed by eternal suffering, and he accepted,\nas the process of civilization, social damnation. He still stood at this\npoint, though safe to advance infallibly later on, since his nature was\ngood, and, at bottom, wholly formed of latent progress.\n\nIn this stage of his ideas, Jean Valjean appeared to him hideous and\nrepulsive. He was a man reproved, he was the convict. That word was\nfor him like the sound of the trump on the Day of Judgment; and, after\nhaving reflected upon Jean Valjean for a long time, his final gesture\nhad been to turn away his head. Vade retro.\n\nMarius, if we must recognize and even insist upon the fact, while\ninterrogating Jean Valjean to such a point that Jean Valjean had said:\n\"You are confessing me,\" had not, nevertheless, put to him two or three\ndecisive questions.\n\nIt was not that they had not presented themselves to his mind, but that\nhe had been afraid of them. The Jondrette attic? The barricade? Javert?\nWho knows where these revelations would have stopped? Jean Valjean did\nnot seem like a man who would draw back, and who knows whether Marius,\nafter having urged him on, would not have himself desired to hold him\nback?\n\nHas it not happened to all of us, in certain supreme conjunctures, to\nstop our ears in order that we may not hear the reply, after we have\nasked a question? It is especially when one loves that one gives way\nto these exhibitions of cowardice. It is not wise to question sinister\nsituations to the last point, particularly when the indissoluble side of\nour life is fatally intermingled with them. What a terrible light might\nhave proceeded from the despairing explanations of Jean Valjean, and who\nknows whether that hideous glare would not have darted forth as far\nas Cosette? Who knows whether a sort of infernal glow would not have\nlingered behind it on the brow of that angel? The spattering of a\nlightning-flash is of the thunder also. Fatality has points of juncture\nwhere innocence itself is stamped with crime by the gloomy law of the\nreflections which give color. The purest figures may forever preserve\nthe reflection of a horrible association. Rightly or wrongly, Marius\nhad been afraid. He already knew too much. He sought to dull his senses\nrather than to gain further light.\n\nIn dismay he bore off Cosette in his arms and shut his eyes to Jean\nValjean.\n\nThat man was the night, the living and horrible night. How should he\ndare to seek the bottom of it? It is a terrible thing to interrogate\nthe shadow. Who knows what its reply will be? The dawn may be blackened\nforever by it.\n\nIn this state of mind the thought that that man would, henceforth, come\ninto any contact whatever with Cosette was a heartrending perplexity to\nMarius.\n\nHe now almost reproached himself for not having put those formidable\nquestions, before which he had recoiled, and from which an implacable\nand definitive decision might have sprung. He felt that he was too good,\ntoo gentle, too weak, if we must say the word. This weakness had led him\nto an imprudent concession. He had allowed himself to be touched. He\nhad been in the wrong. He ought to have simply and purely rejected\nJean Valjean. Jean Valjean played the part of fire, and that is what he\nshould have done, and have freed his house from that man.\n\nHe was vexed with himself, he was angry with that whirlwind of emotions\nwhich had deafened, blinded, and carried him away. He was displeased\nwith himself.\n\nWhat was he to do now? Jean Valjean's visits were profoundly repugnant\nto him. What was the use in having that man in his house? What did the\nman want? Here, he became dismayed, he did not wish to dig down, he did\nnot wish to penetrate deeply; he did not wish to sound himself. He\nhad promised, he had allowed himself to be drawn into a promise; Jean\nValjean held his promise; one must keep one's word even to a convict,\nabove all to a convict. Still, his first duty was to Cosette. In short,\nhe was carried away by the repugnance which dominated him.\n\nMarius turned over all this confusion of ideas in his mind, passing\nfrom one to the other, and moved by all of them. Hence arose a profound\ntrouble.\n\nIt was not easy for him to hide this trouble from Cosette, but love is a\ntalent, and Marius succeeded in doing it.\n\nHowever, without any apparent object, he questioned Cosette, who was as\ncandid as a dove is white and who suspected nothing; he talked of her\nchildhood and her youth, and he became more and more convinced that that\nconvict had been everything good, paternal and respectable that a man\ncan be towards Cosette. All that Marius had caught a glimpse of and had\nsurmised was real. That sinister nettle had loved and protected that\nlily.\n\n\n\n\nBOOK EIGHTH.--FADING AWAY OF THE TWILIGHT\n\n[Illustration: The Twilight Decline  5b8-1-decline]\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I--THE LOWER CHAMBER\n\nOn the following day, at nightfall, Jean Valjean knocked at the carriage\ngate of the Gillenormand house. It was Basque who received him. Basque\nwas in the courtyard at the appointed hour, as though he had received\nhis orders. It sometimes happens that one says to a servant: \"You will\nwatch for Mr. So and So, when he arrives.\"\n\nBasque addressed Jean Valjean without waiting for the latter to approach\nhim:\n\n\"Monsieur le Baron has charged me to inquire whether monsieur desires to\ngo upstairs or to remain below?\"\n\n\"I will remain below,\" replied Jean Valjean.\n\nBasque, who was perfectly respectful, opened the door of the\nwaiting-room and said:\n\n\"I will go and inform Madame.\"\n\nThe room which Jean Valjean entered was a damp, vaulted room on the\nground floor, which served as a cellar on occasion, which opened on the\nstreet, was paved with red squares and was badly lighted by a grated\nwindow.\n\nThis chamber was not one of those which are harassed by the\nfeather-duster, the pope's head brush, and the broom. The dust rested\ntranquilly there. Persecution of the spiders was not organized there. A\nfine web, which spread far and wide, and was very black and ornamented\nwith dead flies, formed a wheel on one of the window-panes. The room,\nwhich was small and low-ceiled, was furnished with a heap of empty\nbottles piled up in one corner.\n\nThe wall, which was daubed with an ochre yellow wash, was scaling off in\nlarge flakes. At one end there was a chimney-piece painted in black\nwith a narrow shelf. A fire was burning there; which indicated that Jean\nValjean's reply: \"I will remain below,\" had been foreseen.\n\nTwo arm-chairs were placed at the two corners of the fireplace. Between\nthe chairs an old bedside rug, which displayed more foundation thread\nthan wool, had been spread by way of a carpet.\n\nThe chamber was lighted by the fire on the hearth and the twilight\nfalling through the window.\n\nJean Valjean was fatigued. For days he had neither eaten nor slept. He\nthrew himself into one of the arm-chairs.\n\nBasque returned, set a lighted candle on the chimney-piece and retired.\nJean Valjean, his head drooping and his chin resting on his breast,\nperceived neither Basque nor the candle.\n\nAll at once, he drew himself up with a start. Cosette was standing\nbeside him.\n\nHe had not seen her enter, but he had felt that she was there.\n\nHe turned round. He gazed at her. She was adorably lovely. But what he\nwas contemplating with that profound gaze was not her beauty but her\nsoul.\n\n\"Well,\" exclaimed Cosette, \"father, I knew that you were peculiar, but\nI never should have expected this. What an idea! Marius told me that you\nwish me to receive you here.\"\n\n\"Yes, it is my wish.\"\n\n\"I expected that reply. Good. I warn you that I am going to make a scene\nfor you. Let us begin at the beginning. Embrace me, father.\"\n\nAnd she offered him her cheek.\n\nJean Valjean remained motionless.\n\n\"You do not stir. I take note of it. Attitude of guilt. But never mind,\nI pardon you. Jesus Christ said: Offer the other cheek. Here it is.\"\n\nAnd she presented her other cheek.\n\nJean Valjean did not move. It seemed as though his feet were nailed to\nthe pavement.\n\n\"This is becoming serious,\" said Cosette. \"What have I done to you? I\ndeclare that I am perplexed. You owe me reparation. You will dine with\nus.\"\n\n\"I have dined.\"\n\n\"That is not true. I will get M. Gillenormand to scold you. Grandfathers\nare made to reprimand fathers. Come. Go upstairs with me to the\ndrawing-room. Immediately.\"\n\n\"Impossible.\"\n\nHere Cosette lost ground a little. She ceased to command and passed to\nquestioning.\n\n\"But why? and you choose the ugliest chamber in the house in which to\nsee me. It's horrible here.\"\n\n\"Thou knowest . . .\"\n\nJean Valjean caught himself up.\n\n\"You know, madame, that I am peculiar, I have my freaks.\"\n\nCosette struck her tiny hands together.\n\n\"Madame! . . . You know! . . . more novelties! What is the meaning of\nthis?\"\n\nJean Valjean directed upon her that heartrending smile to which he\noccasionally had recourse:\n\n\"You wished to be Madame. You are so.\"\n\n\"Not for you, father.\"\n\n\"Do not call me father.\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"Call me 'Monsieur Jean.' 'Jean,' if you like.\"\n\n\"You are no longer my father? I am no longer Cosette? 'Monsieur Jean'?\nWhat does this mean? why, these are revolutions, aren't they? what has\ntaken place? come, look me in the face. And you won't live with us!\nAnd you won't have my chamber! What have I done to you? Has anything\nhappened?\"\n\n\"Nothing.\"\n\n\"Well then?\"\n\n\"Everything is as usual.\"\n\n\"Why do you change your name?\"\n\n\"You have changed yours, surely.\"\n\nHe smiled again with the same smile as before and added:\n\n\"Since you are Madame Pontmercy, I certainly can be Monsieur Jean.\"\n\n\"I don't understand anything about it. All this is idiotic. I shall ask\npermission of my husband for you to be 'Monsieur Jean.' I hope that he\nwill not consent to it. You cause me a great deal of pain. One does\nhave freaks, but one does not cause one's little Cosette grief. That is\nwrong. You have no right to be wicked, you who are so good.\"\n\nHe made no reply.\n\nShe seized his hands with vivacity, and raising them to her face with\nan irresistible movement, she pressed them against her neck beneath her\nchin, which is a gesture of profound tenderness.\n\n\"Oh!\" she said to him, \"be good!\"\n\nAnd she went on:\n\n\"This is what I call being good: being nice and coming and living\nhere,--there are birds here as there are in the Rue Plumet,--living with\nus, quitting that hole of a Rue de l'Homme Arme, not giving us riddles\nto guess, being like all the rest of the world, dining with us,\nbreakfasting with us, being my father.\"\n\nHe loosed her hands.\n\n\"You no longer need a father, you have a husband.\"\n\nCosette became angry.\n\n\"I no longer need a father! One really does not know what to say to\nthings like that, which are not common sense!\"\n\n\"If Toussaint were here,\" resumed Jean Valjean, like a person who is\ndriven to seek authorities, and who clutches at every branch, \"she would\nbe the first to agree that it is true that I have always had ways of my\nown. There is nothing new in this. I always have loved my black corner.\"\n\n\"But it is cold here. One cannot see distinctly. It is abominable, that\nit is, to wish to be Monsieur Jean! I will not have you say 'you' to me.\n\n\"Just now, as I was coming hither,\" replied Jean Valjean, \"I saw a piece\nof furniture in the Rue Saint Louis. It was at a cabinet-maker's. If I\nwere a pretty woman, I would treat myself to that bit of furniture. A\nvery neat toilet table in the reigning style. What you call rosewood, I\nthink. It is inlaid. The mirror is quite large. There are drawers. It is\npretty.\"\n\n\"Hou! the villainous bear!\" replied Cosette.\n\nAnd with supreme grace, setting her teeth and drawing back her lips, she\nblew at Jean Valjean. She was a Grace copying a cat.\n\n\"I am furious,\" she resumed. \"Ever since yesterday, you have made me\nrage, all of you. I am greatly vexed. I don't understand. You do not\ndefend me against Marius. Marius will not uphold me against you. I am\nall alone. I arrange a chamber prettily. If I could have put the good\nGod there I would have done it. My chamber is left on my hands. My\nlodger sends me into bankruptcy. I order a nice little dinner of\nNicolette. We will have nothing to do with your dinner, Madame. And my\nfather Fauchelevent wants me to call him 'Monsieur Jean,' and to receive\nhim in a frightful, old, ugly cellar, where the walls have beards, and\nwhere the crystal consists of empty bottles, and the curtains are of\nspiders' webs! You are singular, I admit, that is your style, but people\nwho get married are granted a truce. You ought not to have begun being\nsingular again instantly. So you are going to be perfectly contented in\nyour abominable Rue de l'Homme Arme. I was very desperate indeed there,\nthat I was. What have you against me? You cause me a great deal of\ngrief. Fi!\"\n\nAnd, becoming suddenly serious, she gazed intently at Jean Valjean and\nadded:\n\n\"Are you angry with me because I am happy?\"\n\nIngenuousness sometimes unconsciously penetrates deep. This question,\nwhich was simple for Cosette, was profound for Jean Valjean. Cosette had\nmeant to scratch, and she lacerated.\n\nJean Valjean turned pale.\n\nHe remained for a moment without replying, then, with an inexpressible\nintonation, and speaking to himself, he murmured:\n\n\"Her happiness was the object of my life. Now God may sign my dismissal.\nCosette, thou art happy; my day is over.\"\n\n\"Ah, you have said thou to me!\" exclaimed Cosette.\n\nAnd she sprang to his neck.\n\nJean Valjean, in bewilderment, strained her wildly to his breast. It\nalmost seemed to him as though he were taking her back.\n\n\"Thanks, father!\" said Cosette.\n\nThis enthusiastic impulse was on the point of becoming poignant for Jean\nValjean. He gently removed Cosette's arms, and took his hat.\n\n\"Well?\" said Cosette.\n\n\"I leave you, Madame, they are waiting for you.\"\n\nAnd, from the threshold, he added:\n\n\"I have said thou to you. Tell your husband that this shall not happen\nagain. Pardon me.\"\n\nJean Valjean quitted the room, leaving Cosette stupefied at this\nenigmatical farewell.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II--ANOTHER STEP BACKWARDS\n\nOn the following day, at the same hour, Jean Valjean came.\n\nCosette asked him no questions, was no longer astonished, no longer\nexclaimed that she was cold, no longer spoke of the drawing-room, she\navoided saying either \"father\" or \"Monsieur Jean.\" She allowed herself\nto be addressed as you. She allowed herself to be called Madame. Only,\nher joy had undergone a certain diminution. She would have been sad, if\nsadness had been possible to her.\n\nIt is probable that she had had with Marius one of those conversations\nin which the beloved man says what he pleases, explains nothing, and\nsatisfies the beloved woman. The curiosity of lovers does not extend\nvery far beyond their own love.\n\nThe lower room had made a little toilet. Basque had suppressed the\nbottles, and Nicolette the spiders.\n\nAll the days which followed brought Jean Valjean at the same hour. He\ncame every day, because he had not the strength to take Marius' words\notherwise than literally. Marius arranged matters so as to be absent at\nthe hours when Jean Valjean came. The house grew accustomed to the novel\nways of M. Fauchelevent. Toussaint helped in this direction: \"Monsieur\nhas always been like that,\" she repeated. The grandfather issued this\ndecree:--\"He's an original.\" And all was said. Moreover, at the age of\nninety-six, no bond is any longer possible, all is merely juxtaposition;\na newcomer is in the way. There is no longer any room; all habits are\nacquired. M. Fauchelevent, M. Tranchelevent, Father Gillenormand\nasked nothing better than to be relieved from \"that gentleman.\" He\nadded:--\"Nothing is more common than those originals. They do all sorts\nof queer things. They have no reason. The Marquis de Canaples was still\nworse. He bought a palace that he might lodge in the garret. These are\nfantastic appearances that people affect.\"\n\nNo one caught a glimpse of the sinister foundation. And moreover, who\ncould have guessed such a thing? There are marshes of this description\nin India. The water seems extraordinary, inexplicable, rippling though\nthere is no wind, and agitated where it should be calm. One gazes at the\nsurface of these causeless ebullitions; one does not perceive the hydra\nwhich crawls on the bottom.\n\nMany men have a secret monster in this same manner, a dragon which gnaws\nthem, a despair which inhabits their night. Such a man resembles\nother men, he goes and comes. No one knows that he bears within him a\nfrightful parasitic pain with a thousand teeth, which lives within the\nunhappy man, and of which he is dying. No one knows that this man is a\ngulf. He is stagnant but deep. From time to time, a trouble of which\nthe onlooker understands nothing appears on his surface. A mysterious\nwrinkle is formed, then vanishes, then re-appears; an air-bubble rises\nand bursts. It is the breathing of the unknown beast.\n\nCertain strange habits: arriving at the hour when other people are\ntaking their leave, keeping in the background when other people\nare displaying themselves, preserving on all occasions what may be\ndesignated as the wall-colored mantle, seeking the solitary walk,\npreferring the deserted street, avoiding any share in conversation,\navoiding crowds and festivals, seeming at one's ease and living poorly,\nhaving one's key in one's pocket, and one's candle at the porter's\nlodge, however rich one may be, entering by the side door, ascending\nthe private staircase,--all these insignificant singularities, fugitive\nfolds on the surface, often proceed from a formidable foundation.\n\nMany weeks passed in this manner. A new life gradually took possession\nof Cosette: the relations which marriage creates, visits, the care\nof the house, pleasures, great matters. Cosette's pleasures were not\ncostly, they consisted in one thing: being with Marius. The great\noccupation of her life was to go out with him, to remain with him. It\nwas for them a joy that was always fresh, to go out arm in arm, in the\nface of the sun, in the open street, without hiding themselves, before\nthe whole world, both of them completely alone.\n\nCosette had one vexation. Toussaint could not get on with Nicolette, the\nsoldering of two elderly maids being impossible, and she went away.\nThe grandfather was well; Marius argued a case here and there; Aunt\nGillenormand peacefully led that life aside which sufficed for her,\nbeside the new household. Jean Valjean came every day.\n\nThe address as thou disappeared, the you, the \"Madame,\" the \"Monsieur\nJean,\" rendered him another person to Cosette. The care which he had\nhimself taken to detach her from him was succeeding. She became more and\nmore gay and less and less tender. Yet she still loved him sincerely,\nand he felt it.\n\nOne day she said to him suddenly: \"You used to be my father, you are\nno longer my father, you were my uncle, you are no longer my uncle, you\nwere Monsieur Fauchelevent, you are Jean. Who are you then? I don't\nlike all this. If I did not know how good you are, I should be afraid of\nyou.\"\n\nHe still lived in the Rue de l'Homme Arme, because he could not make up\nhis mind to remove to a distance from the quarter where Cosette dwelt.\n\nAt first, he only remained a few minutes with Cosette, and then went\naway.\n\nLittle by little he acquired the habit of making his visits less brief.\nOne would have said that he was taking advantage of the authorization of\nthe days which were lengthening, he arrived earlier and departed later.\n\nOne day Cosette chanced to say \"father\" to him. A flash of joy\nilluminated Jean Valjean's melancholy old countenance. He caught her\nup: \"Say Jean.\"--\"Ah! truly,\" she replied with a burst of laughter,\n\"Monsieur Jean.\"--\"That is right,\" said he. And he turned aside so that\nshe might not see him wipe his eyes.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III--THEY RECALL THE GARDEN OF THE RUE PLUMET\n\nThis was the last time. After that last flash of light, complete\nextinction ensued. No more familiarity, no more good-morning with a\nkiss, never more that word so profoundly sweet: \"My father!\" He was at\nhis own request and through his own complicity driven out of all his\nhappinesses one after the other; and he had this sorrow, that after\nhaving lost Cosette wholly in one day, he was afterwards obliged to lose\nher again in detail.\n\nThe eye eventually becomes accustomed to the light of a cellar. In\nshort, it sufficed for him to have an apparition of Cosette every day.\nHis whole life was concentrated in that one hour.\n\nHe seated himself close to her, he gazed at her in silence, or he talked\nto her of years gone by, of her childhood, of the convent, of her little\nfriends of those bygone days.\n\nOne afternoon,--it was on one of those early days in April, already\nwarm and fresh, the moment of the sun's great gayety, the gardens which\nsurrounded the windows of Marius and Cosette felt the emotion of waking,\nthe hawthorn was on the point of budding, a jewelled garniture of\ngillyflowers spread over the ancient walls, snapdragons yawned through\nthe crevices of the stones, amid the grass there was a charming\nbeginning of daisies, and buttercups, the white butterflies of the\nyear were making their first appearance, the wind, that minstrel of the\neternal wedding, was trying in the trees the first notes of that grand,\nauroral symphony which the old poets called the springtide,--Marius said\nto Cosette:--\"We said that we would go back to take a look at our garden\nin the Rue Plumet. Let us go thither. We must not be ungrateful.\"--And\naway they flitted, like two swallows towards the spring. This garden of\nthe Rue Plumet produced on them the effect of the dawn. They already\nhad behind them in life something which was like the springtime of their\nlove. The house in the Rue Plumet being held on a lease, still belonged\nto Cosette. They went to that garden and that house. There they\nfound themselves again, there they forgot themselves. That\nevening, at the usual hour, Jean Valjean came to the Rue des\nFilles-du-Calvaire.--\"Madame went out with Monsieur and has not yet\nreturned,\" Basque said to him. He seated himself in silence, and waited\nan hour. Cosette did not return. He departed with drooping head.\n\nCosette was so intoxicated with her walk to \"their garden,\" and so\njoyous at having \"lived a whole day in her past,\" that she talked of\nnothing else on the morrow. She did not notice that she had not seen\nJean Valjean.\n\n\"In what way did you go thither?\" Jean Valjean asked her.\"\n\n\"On foot.\"\n\n\"And how did you return?\"\n\n\"In a hackney carriage.\"\n\nFor some time, Jean Valjean had noticed the economical life led by the\nyoung people. He was troubled by it. Marius' economy was severe, and\nthat word had its absolute meaning for Jean Valjean. He hazarded a\nquery:\n\n\"Why do you not have a carriage of your own? A pretty coupe would only\ncost you five hundred francs a month. You are rich.\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" replied Cosette.\n\n\"It is like Toussaint,\" resumed Jean Valjean. \"She is gone. You have not\nreplaced her. Why?\"\n\n\"Nicolette suffices.\"\n\n\"But you ought to have a maid.\"\n\n\"Have I not Marius?\"\n\n\"You ought to have a house of your own, your own servants, a carriage, a\nbox at the theatre. There is nothing too fine for you. Why not profit by\nyour riches? Wealth adds to happiness.\"\n\nCosette made no reply.\n\nJean Valjean's visits were not abridged. Far from it. When it is the\nheart which is slipping, one does not halt on the downward slope.\n\nWhen Jean Valjean wished to prolong his visit and to induce\nforgetfulness of the hour, he sang the praises of Marius; he pronounced\nhim handsome, noble, courageous, witty, eloquent, good. Cosette outdid\nhim. Jean Valjean began again. They were never weary. Marius--that word\nwas inexhaustible; those six letters contained volumes. In this manner,\nJean Valjean contrived to remain a long time.\n\nIt was so sweet to see Cosette, to forget by her side! It alleviated his\nwounds. It frequently happened that Basque came twice to announce:\n\"M. Gillenormand sends me to remind Madame la Baronne that dinner is\nserved.\"\n\nOn those days, Jean Valjean was very thoughtful on his return home.\n\nWas there, then, any truth in that comparison of the chrysalis which\nhad presented itself to the mind of Marius? Was Jean Valjean really a\nchrysalis who would persist, and who would come to visit his butterfly?\n\nOne day he remained still longer than usual. On the following day he\nobserved that there was no fire on the hearth.--\"Hello!\" he thought. \"No\nfire.\"--And he furnished the explanation for himself.--\"It is perfectly\nsimple. It is April. The cold weather has ceased.\"\n\n\"Heavens! how cold it is here!\" exclaimed Cosette when she entered.\n\n\"Why, no,\" said Jean Valjean.\n\n\"Was it you who told Basque not to make a fire then?\"\n\n\"Yes, since we are now in the month of May.\"\n\n\"But we have a fire until June. One is needed all the year in this\ncellar.\"\n\n\"I thought that a fire was unnecessary.\"\n\n\"That is exactly like one of your ideas!\" retorted Cosette.\n\nOn the following day there was a fire. But the two arm-chairs were\narranged at the other end of the room near the door. \"--What is the\nmeaning of this?\" thought Jean Valjean.\n\nHe went for the arm-chairs and restored them to their ordinary place\nnear the hearth.\n\nThis fire lighted once more encouraged him, however. He prolonged the\nconversation even beyond its customary limits. As he rose to take his\nleave, Cosette said to him:\n\n\"My husband said a queer thing to me yesterday.\"\n\n\"What was it?\"\n\n\"He said to me: 'Cosette, we have an income of thirty thousand livres.\nTwenty-seven that you own, and three that my grandfather gives me.' I\nreplied: 'That makes thirty.' He went on: 'Would you have the courage to\nlive on the three thousand?' I answered: 'Yes, on nothing. Provided\nthat it was with you.' And then I asked: 'Why do you say that to me?' He\nreplied: 'I wanted to know.'\"\n\nJean Valjean found not a word to answer. Cosette probably expected some\nexplanation from him; he listened in gloomy silence. He went back to the\nRue de l'Homme Arme; he was so deeply absorbed that he mistook the\ndoor and instead of entering his own house, he entered the adjoining\ndwelling. It was only after having ascended nearly two stories that he\nperceived his error and went down again.\n\nHis mind was swarming with conjectures. It was evident that Marius had\nhis doubts as to the origin of the six hundred thousand francs, that\nhe feared some source that was not pure, who knows? that he had even,\nperhaps, discovered that the money came from him, Jean Valjean, that he\nhesitated before this suspicious fortune, and was disinclined to take\nit as his own,--preferring that both he and Cosette should remain poor,\nrather than that they should be rich with wealth that was not clean.\n\nMoreover, Jean Valjean began vaguely to surmise that he was being shown\nthe door.\n\nOn the following day, he underwent something like a shock on entering\nthe ground-floor room. The arm-chairs had disappeared. There was not a\nsingle chair of any sort.\n\n\"Ah, what's this!\" exclaimed Cosette as she entered, \"no chairs! Where\nare the arm-chairs?\"\n\n\"They are no longer here,\" replied Jean Valjean.\n\n\"This is too much!\"\n\nJean Valjean stammered:\n\n\"It was I who told Basque to remove them.\"\n\n\"And your reason?\"\n\n\"I have only a few minutes to stay to-day.\"\n\n\"A brief stay is no reason for remaining standing.\"\n\n\"I think that Basque needed the chairs for the drawing-room.\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"You have company this evening, no doubt.\"\n\n\"We expect no one.\"\n\nJean Valjean had not another word to say.\n\nCosette shrugged her shoulders.\n\n\"To have the chairs carried off! The other day you had the fire put out.\nHow odd you are!\"\n\n\"Adieu!\" murmured Jean Valjean.\n\nHe did not say: \"Adieu, Cosette.\" But he had not the strength to say:\n\"Adieu, Madame.\"\n\nHe went away utterly overwhelmed.\n\nThis time he had understood.\n\nOn the following day he did not come. Cosette only observed the fact in\nthe evening.\n\n\"Why,\" said she, \"Monsieur Jean has not been here today.\"\n\nAnd she felt a slight twinge at her heart, but she hardly perceived it,\nbeing immediately diverted by a kiss from Marius.\n\nOn the following day he did not come.\n\nCosette paid no heed to this, passed her evening and slept well that\nnight, as usual, and thought of it only when she woke. She was so happy!\nShe speedily despatched Nicolette to M. Jean's house to inquire whether\nhe were ill, and why he had not come on the previous evening. Nicolette\nbrought back the reply of M. Jean that he was not ill. He was busy. He\nwould come soon. As soon as he was able. Moreover, he was on the point\nof taking a little journey. Madame must remember that it was his custom\nto take trips from time to time. They were not to worry about him. They\nwere not to think of him.\n\nNicolette on entering M. Jean's had repeated to him her mistress' very\nwords. That Madame had sent her to inquire why M. Jean bad not come on\nthe preceding evening.\"--It is two days since I have been there,\" said\nJean Valjean gently.\n\nBut the remark passed unnoticed by Nicolette, who did not report it to\nCosette.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV--ATTRACTION AND EXTINCTION\n\nDuring the last months of spring and the first months of summer in 1833,\nthe rare passersby in the Marais, the petty shopkeepers, the loungers on\nthresholds, noticed an old man neatly clad in black, who emerged every\nday at the same hour, towards nightfall, from the Rue de l'Homme Arme,\non the side of the Rue Sainte-Croix-de-la-Bretonnerie, passed in front\nof the Blancs Manteaux, gained the Rue Culture-Sainte-Catherine, and,\non arriving at the Rue de l'Echarpe, turned to the left, and entered the\nRue Saint-Louis.\n\nThere he walked at a slow pace, with his head strained forward, seeing\nnothing, hearing nothing, his eye immovably fixed on a point which\nseemed to be a star to him, which never varied, and which was no\nother than the corner of the Rue des Filles-du-Calvaire. The nearer he\napproached the corner of the street the more his eye lighted up; a sort\nof joy illuminated his pupils like an inward aurora, he had a fascinated\nand much affected air, his lips indulged in obscure movements, as though\nhe were talking to some one whom he did not see, he smiled vaguely and\nadvanced as slowly as possible. One would have said that, while desirous\nof reaching his destination, he feared the moment when he should be\nclose at hand. When only a few houses remained between him and that\nstreet which appeared to attract him his pace slackened, to such a\ndegree that, at times, one might have thought that he was no longer\nadvancing at all. The vacillation of his head and the fixity of his\neyeballs suggested the thought of the magnetic needle seeking the pole.\nWhatever time he spent on arriving, he was obliged to arrive at last; he\nreached the Rue des Filles-du-Calvaire; then he halted, he trembled, he\nthrust his head with a sort of melancholy timidity round the corner of\nthe last house, and gazed into that street, and there was in that tragic\nlook something which resembled the dazzling light of the impossible,\nand the reflection from a paradise that was closed to him. Then a tear,\nwhich had slowly gathered in the corner of his lids, and had become\nlarge enough to fall, trickled down his cheek, and sometimes stopped at\nhis mouth. The old man tasted its bitter flavor. Thus he remained for\nseveral minutes as though made of stone, then he returned by the same\nroad and with the same step, and, in proportion as he retreated, his\nglance died out.\n\nLittle by little, this old man ceased to go as far as the corner of the\nRue des Filles-du-Calvaire; he halted half way in the Rue Saint-Louis;\nsometimes a little further off, sometimes a little nearer.\n\nOne day he stopped at the corner of the Rue Culture-Sainte-Catherine and\nlooked at the Rue des Filles-du-Calvaire from a distance. Then he\nshook his head slowly from right to left, as though refusing himself\nsomething, and retraced his steps.\n\nSoon he no longer came as far as the Rue Saint-Louis. He got as far as\nthe Rue Pavee, shook his head and turned back; then he went no\nfurther than the Rue des Trois-Pavillons; then he did not overstep the\nBlancs-Manteaux. One would have said that he was a pendulum which was\nno longer wound up, and whose oscillations were growing shorter before\nceasing altogether.\n\nEvery day he emerged from his house at the same hour, he undertook the\nsame trip, but he no longer completed it, and, perhaps without\nhimself being aware of the fact, he constantly shortened it. His whole\ncountenance expressed this single idea: What is the use?--His eye was\ndim; no more radiance. His tears were also exhausted; they no longer\ncollected in the corner of his eye-lid; that thoughtful eye was dry. The\nold man's head was still craned forward; his chin moved at times; the\nfolds in his gaunt neck were painful to behold. Sometimes, when the\nweather was bad, he had an umbrella under his arm, but he never opened\nit.\n\nThe good women of the quarter said: \"He is an innocent.\" The children\nfollowed him and laughed.\n\n\n\n\nBOOK NINTH.--SUPREME SHADOW, SUPREME DAWN\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I--PITY FOR THE UNHAPPY, BUT INDULGENCE FOR THE HAPPY\n\nIt is a terrible thing to be happy! How content one is! How\nall-sufficient one finds it! How, being in possession of the false\nobject of life, happiness, one forgets the true object, duty!\n\nLet us say, however, that the reader would do wrong were he to blame\nMarius.\n\nMarius, as we have explained, before his marriage, had put no questions\nto M. Fauchelevent, and, since that time, he had feared to put any to\nJean Valjean. He had regretted the promise into which he had allowed\nhimself to be drawn. He had often said to himself that he had done\nwrong in making that concession to despair. He had confined himself to\ngradually estranging Jean Valjean from his house and to effacing him,\nas much as possible, from Cosette's mind. He had, in a manner, always\nplaced himself between Cosette and Jean Valjean, sure that, in this\nway, she would not perceive nor think of the latter. It was more than\neffacement, it was an eclipse.\n\nMarius did what he considered necessary and just. He thought that he had\nserious reasons which the reader has already seen, and others which will\nbe seen later on, for getting rid of Jean Valjean without harshness, but\nwithout weakness.\n\nChance having ordained that he should encounter, in a case which he had\nargued, a former employee of the Laffitte establishment, he had acquired\nmysterious information, without seeking it, which he had not been\nable, it is true, to probe, out of respect for the secret which he had\npromised to guard, and out of consideration for Jean Valjean's perilous\nposition. He believed at that moment that he had a grave duty to\nperform: the restitution of the six hundred thousand francs to some\none whom he sought with all possible discretion. In the meanwhile, he\nabstained from touching that money.\n\nAs for Cosette, she had not been initiated into any of these secrets;\nbut it would be harsh to condemn her also.\n\nThere existed between Marius and her an all-powerful magnetism, which\ncaused her to do, instinctively and almost mechanically, what Marius\nwished. She was conscious of Marius' will in the direction of \"Monsieur\nJean,\" she conformed to it. Her husband had not been obliged to say\nanything to her; she yielded to the vague but clear pressure of his\ntacit intentions, and obeyed blindly. Her obedience in this instance\nconsisted in not remembering what Marius forgot. She was not obliged to\nmake any effort to accomplish this. Without her knowing why herself, and\nwithout his having any cause to accuse her of it, her soul had become\nso wholly her husband's that that which was shrouded in gloom in Marius'\nmind became overcast in hers.\n\nLet us not go too far, however; in what concerns Jean Valjean, this\nforgetfulness and obliteration were merely superficial. She was rather\nheedless than forgetful. At bottom, she was sincerely attached to the\nman whom she had so long called her father; but she loved her husband\nstill more dearly. This was what had somewhat disturbed the balance of\nher heart, which leaned to one side only.\n\nIt sometimes happened that Cosette spoke of Jean Valjean and expressed\nher surprise. Then Marius calmed her: \"He is absent, I think. Did not\nhe say that he was setting out on a journey?\"--\"That is true,\" thought\nCosette. \"He had a habit of disappearing in this fashion. But not for so\nlong.\" Two or three times she despatched Nicolette to inquire in the\nRue de l'Homme Arme whether M. Jean had returned from his journey. Jean\nValjean caused the answer \"no\" to be given.\n\nCosette asked nothing more, since she had but one need on earth, Marius.\n\nLet us also say that, on their side, Cosette and Marius had also\nbeen absent. They had been to Vernon. Marius had taken Cosette to his\nfather's grave.\n\nMarius gradually won Cosette away from Jean Valjean. Cosette allowed it.\n\nMoreover that which is called, far too harshly in certain cases, the\ningratitude of children, is not always a thing so deserving of reproach\nas it is supposed. It is the ingratitude of nature. Nature, as we have\nelsewhere said, \"looks before her.\" Nature divides living beings into\nthose who are arriving and those who are departing. Those who are\ndeparting are turned towards the shadows, those who are arriving towards\nthe light. Hence a gulf which is fatal on the part of the old, and\ninvoluntary on the part of the young. This breach, at first insensible,\nincreases slowly, like all separations of branches. The boughs, without\nbecoming detached from the trunk, grow away from it. It is no fault of\ntheirs. Youth goes where there is joy, festivals, vivid lights, love.\nOld age goes towards the end. They do not lose sight of each other, but\nthere is no longer a close connection. Young people feel the cooling\noff of life; old people, that of the tomb. Let us not blame these poor\nchildren.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II--LAST FLICKERINGS OF A LAMP WITHOUT OIL\n\nOne day, Jean Valjean descended his staircase, took three steps in the\nstreet, seated himself on a post, on that same stone post where Gavroche\nhad found him meditating on the night between the 5th and the 6th of\nJune; he remained there a few moments, then went up stairs again. This\nwas the last oscillation of the pendulum. On the following day he did\nnot leave his apartment. On the day after that, he did not leave his\nbed.\n\nHis portress, who prepared his scanty repasts, a few cabbages or\npotatoes with bacon, glanced at the brown earthenware plate and\nexclaimed:\n\n\"But you ate nothing yesterday, poor, dear man!\"\n\n\"Certainly I did,\" replied Jean Valjean.\n\n\"The plate is quite full.\"\n\n\"Look at the water jug. It is empty.\"\n\n\"That proves that you have drunk; it does not prove that you have\neaten.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Jean Valjean, \"what if I felt hungry only for water?\"\n\n\"That is called thirst, and, when one does not eat at the same time, it\nis called fever.\"\n\n\"I will eat to-morrow.\"\n\n\"Or at Trinity day. Why not to-day? Is it the thing to say: 'I will eat\nto-morrow'? The idea of leaving my platter without even touching it! My\nladyfinger potatoes were so good!\"\n\nJean Valjean took the old woman's hand:\n\n\"I promise you that I will eat them,\" he said, in his benevolent voice.\n\n\"I am not pleased with you,\" replied the portress.\n\nJean Valjean saw no other human creature than this good woman. There are\nstreets in Paris through which no one ever passes, and houses to which\nno one ever comes. He was in one of those streets and one of those\nhouses.\n\nWhile he still went out, he had purchased of a coppersmith, for a few\nsous, a little copper crucifix which he had hung up on a nail opposite\nhis bed. That gibbet is always good to look at.\n\nA week passed, and Jean Valjean had not taken a step in his room. He\nstill remained in bed. The portress said to her husband:--\"The good man\nupstairs yonder does not get up, he no longer eats, he will not last\nlong. That man has his sorrows, that he has. You won't get it out of my\nhead that his daughter has made a bad marriage.\"\n\nThe porter replied, with the tone of marital sovereignty:\n\n\"If he's rich, let him have a doctor. If he is not rich, let him go\nwithout. If he has no doctor he will die.\"\n\n\"And if he has one?\"\n\n\"He will die,\" said the porter.\n\nThe portress set to scraping away the grass from what she called her\npavement, with an old knife, and, as she tore out the blades, she\ngrumbled:\n\n\"It's a shame. Such a neat old man! He's as white as a chicken.\"\n\nShe caught sight of the doctor of the quarter as he passed the end of\nthe street; she took it upon herself to request him to come up stairs.\n\n\"It's on the second floor,\" said she. \"You have only to enter. As the\ngood man no longer stirs from his bed, the door is always unlocked.\"\n\nThe doctor saw Jean Valjean and spoke with him.\n\nWhen he came down again the portress interrogated him:\n\n\"Well, doctor?\"\n\n\"Your sick man is very ill indeed.\"\n\n\"What is the matter with him?\"\n\n\"Everything and nothing. He is a man who, to all appearances, has lost\nsome person who is dear to him. People die of that.\"\n\n\"What did he say to you?\"\n\n\"He told me that he was in good health.\"\n\n\"Shall you come again, doctor?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" replied the doctor. \"But some one else besides must come.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III--A PEN IS HEAVY TO THE MAN WHO LIFTED THE FAUCHELEVENT'S\nCART\n\nOne evening Jean Valjean found difficulty in raising himself on his\nelbow; he felt of his wrist and could not find his pulse; his breath\nwas short and halted at times; he recognized the fact that he was weaker\nthan he had ever been before. Then, no doubt under the pressure of some\nsupreme preoccupation, he made an effort, drew himself up into a sitting\nposture and dressed himself. He put on his old workingman's clothes. As\nhe no longer went out, he had returned to them and preferred them. He\nwas obliged to pause many times while dressing himself; merely putting\nhis arms through his waistcoat made the perspiration trickle from his\nforehead.\n\nSince he had been alone, he had placed his bed in the antechamber, in\norder to inhabit that deserted apartment as little as possible.\n\nHe opened the valise and drew from it Cosette's outfit.\n\nHe spread it out on his bed.\n\nThe Bishop's candlesticks were in their place on the chimney-piece. He\ntook from a drawer two wax candles and put them in the candlesticks.\nThen, although it was still broad daylight,--it was summer,--he lighted\nthem. In the same way candles are to be seen lighted in broad daylight\nin chambers where there is a corpse.\n\nEvery step that he took in going from one piece of furniture to another\nexhausted him, and he was obliged to sit down. It was not ordinary\nfatigue which expends the strength only to renew it; it was the remnant\nof all movement possible to him, it was life drained which flows away\ndrop by drop in overwhelming efforts and which will never be renewed.\n\nThe chair into which he allowed himself to fall was placed in front of\nthat mirror, so fatal for him, so providential for Marius, in which\nhe had read Cosette's reversed writing on the blotting book. He caught\nsight of himself in this mirror, and did not recognize himself. He was\neighty years old; before Marius' marriage, he would have hardly been\ntaken for fifty; that year had counted for thirty. What he bore on his\nbrow was no longer the wrinkles of age, it was the mysterious mark of\ndeath. The hollowing of that pitiless nail could be felt there. His\ncheeks were pendulous; the skin of his face had the color which would\nlead one to think that it already had earth upon it; the corners of his\nmouth drooped as in the mask which the ancients sculptured on tombs. He\ngazed into space with an air of reproach; one would have said that he\nwas one of those grand tragic beings who have cause to complain of some\none.\n\nHe was in that condition, the last phase of dejection, in which sorrow\nno longer flows; it is coagulated, so to speak; there is something on\nthe soul like a clot of despair.\n\nNight had come. He laboriously dragged a table and the old arm-chair to\nthe fireside, and placed upon the table a pen, some ink and some paper.\n\nThat done, he had a fainting fit. When he recovered consciousness, he\nwas thirsty. As he could not lift the jug, he tipped it over painfully\ntowards his mouth, and swallowed a draught.\n\nAs neither the pen nor the ink had been used for a long time, the point\nof the pen had curled up, the ink had dried away, he was forced to rise\nand put a few drops of water in the ink, which he did not accomplish\nwithout pausing and sitting down two or three times, and he was\ncompelled to write with the back of the pen. He wiped his brow from time\nto time.\n\nThen he turned towards the bed, and, still seated, for he could not\nstand, he gazed at the little black gown and all those beloved objects.\n\nThese contemplations lasted for hours which seemed minutes.\n\nAll at once he shivered, he felt that a child was taking possession of\nhim; he rested his elbows on the table, which was illuminated by the\nBishop's candles and took up the pen. His hand trembled. He wrote slowly\nthe few following lines:\n\n\"Cosette, I bless thee. I am going to explain to thee. Thy husband was\nright in giving me to understand that I ought to go away; but there is\na little error in what he believed, though he was in the right. He is\nexcellent. Love him well even after I am dead. Monsieur Pontmercy, love\nmy darling child well. Cosette, this paper will be found; this is what\nI wish to say to thee, thou wilt see the figures, if I have the strength\nto recall them, listen well, this money is really thine. Here is the\nwhole matter: White jet comes from Norway, black jet comes from England,\nblack glass jewellery comes from Germany. Jet is the lightest, the most\nprecious, the most costly. Imitations can be made in France as well as\nin Germany. What is needed is a little anvil two inches square, and a\nlamp burning spirits of wine to soften the wax. The wax was formerly\nmade with resin and lampblack, and cost four livres the pound. I\ninvented a way of making it with gum shellac and turpentine. It does not\ncost more than thirty sous, and is much better. Buckles are made with\na violet glass which is stuck fast, by means of this wax, to a little\nframework of black iron. The glass must be violet for iron jewellery,\nand black for gold jewellery. Spain buys a great deal of it. It is the\ncountry of jet . . .\"\n\nHere he paused, the pen fell from his fingers, he was seized by one of\nthose sobs which at times welled up from the very depths of his being;\nthe poor man clasped his head in both hands, and meditated.\n\n\"Oh!\" he exclaimed within himself [lamentable cries, heard by God\nalone], \"all is over. I shall never see her more. She is a smile which\npassed over me. I am about to plunge into the night without even seeing\nher again. Oh! one minute, one instant, to hear her voice, to touch her\ndress, to gaze upon her, upon her, the angel! and then to die! It is\nnothing to die, what is frightful is to die without seeing her. She\nwould smile on me, she would say a word to me, would that do any harm to\nany one? No, all is over, and forever. Here I am all alone. My God! My\nGod! I shall never see her again!\" At that moment there came a knock at\nthe door.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV--A BOTTLE OF INK WHICH ONLY SUCCEEDED IN WHITENING\n\nThat same day, or to speak more accurately, that same evening, as Marius\nleft the table, and was on the point of withdrawing to his study, having\na case to look over, Basque handed him a letter saying: \"The person who\nwrote the letter is in the antechamber.\"\n\nCosette had taken the grandfather's arm and was strolling in the garden.\n\nA letter, like a man, may have an unprepossessing exterior. Coarse\npaper, coarsely folded--the very sight of certain missives is\ndispleasing.\n\nThe letter which Basque had brought was of this sort.\n\nMarius took it. It smelled of tobacco. Nothing evokes a memory like an\nodor. Marius recognized that tobacco. He looked at the superscription:\n\"To Monsieur, Monsieur le Baron Pommerci. At his hotel.\" The recognition\nof the tobacco caused him to recognize the writing as well. It may be\nsaid that amazement has its lightning flashes.\n\nMarius was, as it were, illuminated by one of these flashes.\n\nThe sense of smell, that mysterious aid to memory, had just revived a\nwhole world within him. This was certainly the paper, the fashion\nof folding, the dull tint of ink; it was certainly the well-known\nhandwriting, especially was it the same tobacco.\n\nThe Jondrette garret rose before his mind.\n\nThus, strange freak of chance! one of the two scents which he had so\ndiligently sought, the one in connection with which he had lately again\nexerted so many efforts and which he supposed to be forever lost, had\ncome and presented itself to him of its own accord.\n\nHe eagerly broke the seal, and read:\n\n\n \"Monsieur le Baron:--If the Supreme Being had given me the talents,\n I might have been baron Thenard, member of the Institute [academy\n of ciences], but I am not.  I only bear the same as him, happy if\n this memory recommends me to the eccellence of your kindnesses.\n The benefit with which you will honor me will be reciprocle.\n I am in possession of a secret concerning an individual.\n This individual concerns you.  I hold the secret at your disposal\n desiring to have the honor to be huseful to you.  I will furnish\n you with the simple means of driving from your honorabel family\n that individual who has no right there, madame la baronne being\n of lofty birth.  The sanctuary of virtue cannot cohabit longer\n with crime without abdicating.\n\n \"I awate in the entichamber the orders of monsieur le baron.\n\n                                               \"With respect.\"\n\n\nThe letter was signed \"Thenard.\"\n\nThis signature was not false. It was merely a trifle abridged.\n\nMoreover, the rigmarole and the orthography completed the revelation.\nThe certificate of origin was complete.\n\nMarius' emotion was profound. After a start of surprise, he underwent a\nfeeling of happiness. If he could now but find that other man of whom he\nwas in search, the man who had saved him, Marius, there would be nothing\nleft for him to desire.\n\nHe opened the drawer of his secretary, took out several bank-notes,\nput them in his pocket, closed the secretary again, and rang the bell.\nBasque half opened the door.\n\n\"Show the man in,\" said Marius.\n\nBasque announced:\n\n\"Monsieur Thenard.\"\n\nA man entered.\n\nA fresh surprise for Marius. The man who entered was an utter stranger\nto him.\n\nThis man, who was old, moreover, had a thick nose, his chin swathed in a\ncravat, green spectacles with a double screen of green taffeta over his\neyes, and his hair was plastered and flattened down on his brow on\na level with his eyebrows like the wigs of English coachmen in \"high\nlife.\" His hair was gray. He was dressed in black from head to foot, in\ngarments that were very threadbare but clean; a bunch of seals depending\nfrom his fob suggested the idea of a watch. He held in his hand an old\nhat! He walked in a bent attitude, and the curve in his spine augmented\nthe profundity of his bow.\n\nThe first thing that struck the observer was, that this personage's\ncoat, which was too ample although carefully buttoned, had not been made\nfor him.\n\nHere a short digression becomes necessary.\n\nThere was in Paris at that epoch, in a low-lived old lodging in the Rue\nBeautreillis, near the Arsenal, an ingenious Jew whose profession was\nto change villains into honest men. Not for too long, which might have\nproved embarrassing for the villain. The change was on sight, for a day\nor two, at the rate of thirty sous a day, by means of a costume which\nresembled the honesty of the world in general as nearly as possible.\nThis costumer was called \"the Changer\"; the pickpockets of Paris\nhad given him this name and knew him by no other. He had a tolerably\ncomplete wardrobe. The rags with which he tricked out people were almost\nprobable. He had specialties and categories; on each nail of his\nshop hung a social status, threadbare and worn; here the suit of a\nmagistrate, there the outfit of a Cure, beyond the outfit of a banker,\nin one corner the costume of a retired military man, elsewhere\nthe habiliments of a man of letters, and further on the dress of a\nstatesman.\n\nThis creature was the costumer of the immense drama which knavery plays\nin Paris. His lair was the green-room whence theft emerged, and into\nwhich roguery retreated. A tattered knave arrived at this dressing-room,\ndeposited his thirty sous and selected, according to the part which\nhe wished to play, the costume which suited him, and on descending the\nstairs once more, the knave was a somebody. On the following day, the\nclothes were faithfully returned, and the Changer, who trusted the\nthieves with everything, was never robbed. There was one inconvenience\nabout these clothes, they \"did not fit\"; not having been made for those\nwho wore them, they were too tight for one, too loose for another and\ndid not adjust themselves to any one. Every pickpocket who exceeded or\nfell short of the human average was ill at his ease in the Changer's\ncostumes. It was necessary that one should not be either too fat or\ntoo lean. The changer had foreseen only ordinary men. He had taken the\nmeasure of the species from the first rascal who came to hand, who is\nneither stout nor thin, neither tall nor short. Hence adaptations which\nwere sometimes difficult and from which the Changer's clients extricated\nthemselves as best they might. So much the worse for the exceptions!\nThe suit of the statesman, for instance, black from head to foot, and\nconsequently proper, would have been too large for Pitt and too small\nfor Castelcicala. The costume of a statesman was designated as follows\nin the Changer's catalogue; we copy:\n\n\"A coat of black cloth, trowsers of black wool, a silk waistcoat, boots\nand linen.\" On the margin there stood: ex-ambassador, and a note\nwhich we also copy: \"In a separate box, a neatly frizzed peruke, green\nglasses, seals, and two small quills an inch long, wrapped in cotton.\"\nAll this belonged to the statesman, the ex-ambassador. This whole\ncostume was, if we may so express ourselves, debilitated; the seams were\nwhite, a vague button-hole yawned at one of the elbows; moreover, one of\nthe coat buttons was missing on the breast; but this was only detail; as\nthe hand of the statesman should always be thrust into his coat and laid\nupon his heart, its function was to conceal the absent button.\n\nIf Marius had been familiar with the occult institutions of Paris, he\nwould instantly have recognized upon the back of the visitor whom\nBasque had just shown in, the statesman's suit borrowed from the\npick-me-down-that shop of the Changer.\n\nMarius' disappointment on beholding another man than the one whom he\nexpected to see turned to the newcomer's disadvantage.\n\nHe surveyed him from head to foot, while that personage made exaggerated\nbows, and demanded in a curt tone:\n\n\"What do you want?\"\n\nThe man replied with an amiable grin of which the caressing smile of a\ncrocodile will furnish some idea:\n\n\"It seems to me impossible that I should not have already had the honor\nof seeing Monsieur le Baron in society. I think I actually did meet\nmonsieur personally, several years ago, at the house of Madame la\nPrincesse Bagration and in the drawing-rooms of his Lordship the Vicomte\nDambray, peer of France.\"\n\nIt is always a good bit of tactics in knavery to pretend to recognize\nsome one whom one does not know.\n\nMarius paid attention to the manner of this man's speech. He spied\non his accent and gesture, but his disappointment increased; the\npronunciation was nasal and absolutely unlike the dry, shrill tone which\nhe had expected.\n\nHe was utterly routed.\n\n\"I know neither Madame Bagration nor M. Dambray,\" said he. \"I have never\nset foot in the house of either of them in my life.\"\n\nThe reply was ungracious. The personage, determined to be gracious at\nany cost, insisted.\n\n\"Then it must have been at Chateaubriand's that I have seen Monsieur! I\nknow Chateaubriand very well. He is very affable. He sometimes says to\nme: 'Thenard, my friend . . . won't you drink a glass of wine with me?'\"\n\nMarius' brow grew more and more severe:\n\n\"I have never had the honor of being received by M. de Chateaubriand.\nLet us cut it short. What do you want?\"\n\nThe man bowed lower at that harsh voice.\n\n\"Monsieur le Baron, deign to listen to me. There is in America, in a\ndistrict near Panama, a village called la Joya. That village is composed\nof a single house, a large, square house of three stories, built of\nbricks dried in the sun, each side of the square five hundred feet in\nlength, each story retreating twelve feet back of the story below, in\nsuch a manner as to leave in front a terrace which makes the circuit\nof the edifice, in the centre an inner court where the provisions and\nmunitions are kept; no windows, loopholes, no doors, ladders, ladders\nto mount from the ground to the first terrace, and from the first to the\nsecond, and from the second to the third, ladders to descend into the\ninner court, no doors to the chambers, trap-doors, no staircases to the\nchambers, ladders; in the evening the traps are closed, the ladders\nare withdrawn carbines and blunderbusses trained from the loopholes;\nno means of entering, a house by day, a citadel by night, eight hundred\ninhabitants,--that is the village. Why so many precautions? because the\ncountry is dangerous; it is full of cannibals. Then why do people go\nthere? because the country is marvellous; gold is found there.\"\n\n\"What are you driving at?\" interrupted Marius, who had passed from\ndisappointment to impatience.\n\n\"At this, Monsieur le Baron. I am an old and weary diplomat. Ancient\ncivilization has thrown me on my own devices. I want to try savages.\"\n\n\"Well?\"\n\n\"Monsieur le Baron, egotism is the law of the world. The proletarian\npeasant woman, who toils by the day, turns round when the diligence\npasses by, the peasant proprietress, who toils in her field, does not\nturn round. The dog of the poor man barks at the rich man, the dog\nof the rich man barks at the poor man. Each one for himself.\nSelf-interest--that's the object of men. Gold, that's the loadstone.\"\n\n\"What then? Finish.\"\n\n\"I should like to go and establish myself at la Joya. There are three\nof us. I have my spouse and my young lady; a very beautiful girl. The\njourney is long and costly. I need a little money.\"\n\n\"What concern is that of mine?\" demanded Marius.\n\nThe stranger stretched his neck out of his cravat, a gesture\ncharacteristic of the vulture, and replied with an augmented smile.\n\n\"Has not Monsieur le Baron perused my letter?\"\n\nThere was some truth in this. The fact is, that the contents of the\nepistle had slipped Marius' mind. He had seen the writing rather than\nread the letter. He could hardly recall it. But a moment ago a fresh\nstart had been given him. He had noted that detail: \"my spouse and my\nyoung lady.\"\n\nHe fixed a penetrating glance on the stranger. An examining judge could\nnot have done the look better. He almost lay in wait for him.\n\nHe confined himself to replying:\n\n\"State the case precisely.\"\n\nThe stranger inserted his two hands in both his fobs, drew himself up\nwithout straightening his dorsal column, but scrutinizing Marius in his\nturn, with the green gaze of his spectacles.\n\n\"So be it, Monsieur le Baron. I will be precise. I have a secret to sell\nto you.\"\n\n\"A secret?\"\n\n\"A secret.\"\n\n\"Which concerns me?\"\n\n\"Somewhat.\"\n\n\"What is the secret?\"\n\nMarius scrutinized the man more and more as he listened to him.\n\n\"I commence gratis,\" said the stranger. \"You will see that I am\ninteresting.\"\n\n\"Speak.\"\n\n\"Monsieur le Baron, you have in your house a thief and an assassin.\"\n\nMarius shuddered.\n\n\"In my house? no,\" said he.\n\nThe imperturbable stranger brushed his hat with his elbow and went on:\n\n\"An assassin and a thief. Remark, Monsieur le Baron, that I do not here\nspeak of ancient deeds, deeds of the past which have lapsed, which can\nbe effaced by limitation before the law and by repentance before God.\nI speak of recent deeds, of actual facts as still unknown to justice\nat this hour. I continue. This man has insinuated himself into your\nconfidence, and almost into your family under a false name. I am about\nto tell you his real name. And to tell it to you for nothing.\"\n\n\"I am listening.\"\n\n\"His name is Jean Valjean.\"\n\n\"I know it.\"\n\n\"I am going to tell you, equally for nothing, who he is.\"\n\n\"Say on.\"\n\n\"He is an ex-convict.\"\n\n\"I know it.\"\n\n\"You know it since I have had the honor of telling you.\"\n\n\"No. I knew it before.\"\n\nMarius' cold tone, that double reply of \"I know it,\" his laconicism,\nwhich was not favorable to dialogue, stirred up some smouldering wrath\nin the stranger. He launched a furious glance on the sly at Marius,\nwhich was instantly extinguished. Rapid as it was, this glance was of\nthe kind which a man recognizes when he has once beheld it; it did not\nescape Marius. Certain flashes can only proceed from certain souls;\nthe eye, that vent-hole of the thought, glows with it; spectacles hide\nnothing; try putting a pane of glass over hell!\n\nThe stranger resumed with a smile:\n\n\"I will not permit myself to contradict Monsieur le Baron. In any case,\nyou ought to perceive that I am well informed. Now what I have to tell\nyou is known to myself alone. This concerns the fortune of Madame la\nBaronne. It is an extraordinary secret. It is for sale--I make you the\nfirst offer of it. Cheap. Twenty thousand francs.\"\n\n\"I know that secret as well as the others,\" said Marius.\n\nThe personage felt the necessity of lowering his price a trifle.\n\n\"Monsieur le Baron, say ten thousand francs and I will speak.\"\n\n\"I repeat to you that there is nothing which you can tell me. I know\nwhat you wish to say to me.\"\n\nA fresh flash gleamed in the man's eye. He exclaimed:\n\n\"But I must dine to-day, nevertheless. It is an extraordinary secret,\nI tell you. Monsieur le Baron, I will speak. I speak. Give me twenty\nfrancs.\"\n\nMarius gazed intently at him:\n\n\"I know your extraordinary secret, just as I knew Jean Valjean's name,\njust as I know your name.\"\n\n\"My name?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"That is not difficult, Monsieur le Baron. I had the honor to write to\nyou and to tell it to you. Thenard.\"\n\n\"--Dier.\"\n\n\"Hey?\"\n\n\"Thenardier.\"\n\n\"Who's that?\"\n\nIn danger the porcupine bristles up, the beetle feigns death, the old\nguard forms in a square; this man burst into laughter.\n\nThen he flicked a grain of dust from the sleeve of his coat with a\nfillip.\n\nMarius continued:\n\n\"You are also Jondrette the workman, Fabantou the comedian, Genflot the\npoet, Don Alvares the Spaniard, and Mistress Balizard.\"\n\n\"Mistress what?\"\n\n\"And you kept a pot-house at Montfermeil.\"\n\n\"A pot-house! Never.\"\n\n\"And I tell you that your name is Thenardier.\"\n\n\"I deny it.\"\n\n\"And that you are a rascal. Here.\"\n\nAnd Marius drew a bank-note from his pocket and flung it in his face.\n\n\"Thanks! Pardon me! five hundred francs! Monsieur le Baron!\"\n\nAnd the man, overcome, bowed, seized the note and examined it.\n\n\"Five hundred francs!\" he began again, taken aback. And he stammered in\na low voice: \"An honest rustler.\"[69]\n\nThen brusquely:\n\n\"Well, so be it!\" he exclaimed. \"Let us put ourselves at our ease.\"\n\nAnd with the agility of a monkey, flinging back his hair, tearing off\nhis spectacles, and withdrawing from his nose by sleight of hand the two\nquills of which mention was recently made, and which the reader has also\nmet with on another page of this book, he took off his face as the man\ntakes off his hat.\n\nHis eye lighted up; his uneven brow, with hollows in some places and\nbumps in others, hideously wrinkled at the top, was laid bare, his nose\nhad become as sharp as a beak; the fierce and sagacious profile of the\nman of prey reappeared.\n\n\"Monsieur le Baron is infallible,\" he said in a clear voice whence all\nnasal twang had disappeared, \"I am Thenardier.\"\n\nAnd he straightened up his crooked back.\n\nThenardier, for it was really he, was strangely surprised; he would have\nbeen troubled, had he been capable of such a thing. He had come to bring\nastonishment, and it was he who had received it. This humiliation had\nbeen worth five hundred francs to him, and, taking it all in all, he\naccepted it; but he was none the less bewildered.\n\nHe beheld this Baron Pontmercy for the first time, and, in spite of\nhis disguise, this Baron Pontmercy recognized him, and recognized\nhim thoroughly. And not only was this Baron perfectly informed as to\nThenardier, but he seemed well posted as to Jean Valjean. Who was this\nalmost beardless young man, who was so glacial and so generous, who knew\npeople's names, who knew all their names, and who opened his purse to\nthem, who bullied rascals like a judge, and who paid them like a dupe?\n\nThenardier, the reader will remember, although he had been Marius'\nneighbor, had never seen him, which is not unusual in Paris; he had\nformerly, in a vague way, heard his daughters talk of a very poor young\nman named Marius who lived in the house. He had written to him, without\nknowing him, the letter with which the reader is acquainted.\n\nNo connection between that Marius and M. le Baron Pontmercy was possible\nin his mind.\n\nAs for the name Pontmercy, it will be recalled that, on the battlefield\nof Waterloo, he had only heard the last two syllables, for which he\nalways entertained the legitimate scorn which one owes to what is merely\nan expression of thanks.\n\nHowever, through his daughter Azelma, who had started on the scent of\nthe married pair on the 16th of February, and through his own personal\nresearches, he had succeeded in learning many things, and, from the\ndepths of his own gloom, he had contrived to grasp more than one\nmysterious clew. He had discovered, by dint of industry, or, at least,\nby dint of induction, he had guessed who the man was whom he had\nencountered on a certain day in the Grand Sewer. From the man he had\neasily reached the name. He knew that Madame la Baronne Pontmercy was\nCosette. But he meant to be discreet in that quarter.\n\nWho was Cosette? He did not know exactly himself. He did, indeed, catch\nan inkling of illegitimacy, the history of Fantine had always seemed to\nhim equivocal; but what was the use of talking about that? in order to\ncause himself to be paid for his silence? He had, or thought he had,\nbetter wares than that for sale. And, according to all appearances, if\nhe were to come and make to the Baron Pontmercy this revelation--and\nwithout proof: \"Your wife is a bastard,\" the only result would be to\nattract the boot of the husband towards the loins of the revealer.\n\nFrom Thenardier's point of view, the conversation with Marius had not\nyet begun. He ought to have drawn back, to have modified his strategy,\nto have abandoned his position, to have changed his front; but nothing\nessential had been compromised as yet, and he had five hundred francs\nin his pocket. Moreover, he had something decisive to say, and, even\nagainst this very well-informed and well-armed Baron Pontmercy, he felt\nhimself strong. For men of Thenardier's nature, every dialogue is\na combat. In the one in which he was about to engage, what was his\nsituation? He did not know to whom he was speaking, but he did know of\nwhat he was speaking, he made this rapid review of his inner forces, and\nafter having said: \"I am Thenardier,\" he waited.\n\nMarius had become thoughtful. So he had hold of Thenardier at last.\nThat man whom he had so greatly desired to find was before him. He could\nhonor Colonel Pontmercy's recommendation.\n\nHe felt humiliated that that hero should have owned anything to this\nvillain, and that the letter of change drawn from the depths of the tomb\nby his father upon him, Marius, had been protested up to that day. It\nalso seemed to him, in the complex state of his mind towards Thenardier,\nthat there was occasion to avenge the Colonel for the misfortune of\nhaving been saved by such a rascal. In any case, he was content. He\nwas about to deliver the Colonel's shade from this unworthy creditor\nat last, and it seemed to him that he was on the point of rescuing his\nfather's memory from the debtors' prison. By the side of this duty there\nwas another--to elucidate, if possible, the source of Cosette's fortune.\nThe opportunity appeared to present itself. Perhaps Thenardier knew\nsomething. It might prove useful to see the bottom of this man.\n\nHe commenced with this.\n\nThenardier had caused the \"honest rustler\" to disappear in his fob, and\nwas gazing at Marius with a gentleness that was almost tender.\n\nMarius broke the silence.\n\n\"Thenardier, I have told you your name. Now, would you like to have me\ntell you your secret--the one that you came here to reveal to me? I have\ninformation of my own, also. You shall see that I know more about it\nthan you do. Jean Valjean, as you have said, is an assassin and a thief.\nA thief, because he robbed a wealthy manufacturer, whose ruin he brought\nabout. An assassin, because he assassinated police-agent Javert.\"\n\n\"I don't understand, sir,\" ejaculated Thenardier.\n\n\"I will make myself intelligible. In a certain arrondissement of the Pas\nde Calais, there was, in 1822, a man who had fallen out with justice,\nand who, under the name of M. Madeleine, had regained his status and\nrehabilitated himself. This man had become a just man in the full force\nof the term. In a trade, the manufacture of black glass goods, he\nmade the fortune of an entire city. As far as his personal fortune was\nconcerned he made that also, but as a secondary matter, and in some\nsort, by accident. He was the foster-father of the poor. He founded\nhospitals, opened schools, visited the sick, dowered young girls,\nsupported widows, and adopted orphans; he was like the guardian angel of\nthe country. He refused the cross, he was appointed Mayor. A liberated\nconvict knew the secret of a penalty incurred by this man in former\ndays; he denounced him, and had him arrested, and profited by the arrest\nto come to Paris and cause the banker Laffitte,--I have the fact from\nthe cashier himself,--by means of a false signature, to hand over to\nhim the sum of over half a million which belonged to M. Madeleine. This\nconvict who robbed M. Madeleine was Jean Valjean. As for the other fact,\nyou have nothing to tell me about it either. Jean Valjean killed the\nagent Javert; he shot him with a pistol. I, the person who is speaking\nto you, was present.\"\n\nThenardier cast upon Marius the sovereign glance of a conquered man who\nlays his hand once more upon the victory, and who has just regained, in\none instant, all the ground which he has lost. But the smile returned\ninstantly. The inferior's triumph in the presence of his superior must\nbe wheedling.\n\nThenardier contented himself with saying to Marius:\n\n\"Monsieur le Baron, we are on the wrong track.\"\n\nAnd he emphasized this phrase by making his bunch of seals execute an\nexpressive whirl.\n\n\"What!\" broke forth Marius, \"do you dispute that? These are facts.\"\n\n\"They are chimeras. The confidence with which Monsieur le Baron honors\nme renders it my duty to tell him so. Truth and justice before all\nthings. I do not like to see folks accused unjustly. Monsieur le Baron,\nJean Valjean did not rob M. Madeleine and Jean Valjean did not kill\nJavert.\"\n\n\"This is too much! How is this?\"\n\n\"For two reasons.\"\n\n\"What are they? Speak.\"\n\n\"This is the first: he did not rob M. Madeleine, because it is Jean\nValjean himself who was M. Madeleine.\"\n\n\"What tale are you telling me?\"\n\n\"And this is the second: he did not assassinate Javert, because the\nperson who killed Javert was Javert.\"\n\n\"What do you mean to say?\"\n\n\"That Javert committed suicide.\"\n\n\"Prove it! prove it!\" cried Marius beside himself.\n\nThenardier resumed, scanning his phrase after the manner of the ancient\nAlexandrine measure:\n\n\n\"Police-agent-Ja-vert-was-found-drowned-un-der-a-boat-of-the-Pont-au-Change.\"\n\n\"But prove it!\"\n\nThenardier drew from his pocket a large envelope of gray paper, which\nseemed to contain sheets folded in different sizes.\n\n\"I have my papers,\" he said calmly.\n\nAnd he added:\n\n\"Monsieur le Baron, in your interests I desired to know Jean Valjean\nthoroughly. I say that Jean Valjean and M. Madeleine are one and the\nsame man, and I say that Javert had no other assassin than Javert. If\nI speak, it is because I have proofs. Not manuscript proofs--writing is\nsuspicious, handwriting is complaisant,--but printed proofs.\"\n\nAs he spoke, Thenardier extracted from the envelope two copies of\nnewspapers, yellow, faded, and strongly saturated with tobacco. One of\nthese two newspapers, broken at every fold and falling into rags, seemed\nmuch older than the other.\n\n\"Two facts, two proofs,\" remarked Thenardier. And he offered the two\nnewspapers, unfolded, to Marius.\n\nThe reader is acquainted with these two papers. One, the most ancient, a\nnumber of the Drapeau Blanc of the 25th of July, 1823, the text of\nwhich can be seen in the first volume, established the identity of M.\nMadeleine and Jean Valjean.\n\nThe other, a Moniteur of the 15th of June, 1832, announced the suicide\nof Javert, adding that it appeared from a verbal report of Javert to the\nprefect that, having been taken prisoner in the barricade of the Rue de\nla Chanvrerie, he had owed his life to the magnanimity of an insurgent\nwho, holding him under his pistol, had fired into the air, instead of\nblowing out his brains.\n\nMarius read. He had evidence, a certain date, irrefragable proof, these\ntwo newspapers had not been printed expressly for the purpose of backing\nup Thenardier's statements; the note printed in the Moniteur had been an\nadministrative communication from the Prefecture of Police. Marius could\nnot doubt.\n\nThe information of the cashier-clerk had been false, and he himself had\nbeen deceived.\n\nJean Valjean, who had suddenly grown grand, emerged from his cloud.\nMarius could not repress a cry of joy.\n\n\"Well, then this unhappy wretch is an admirable man! the whole of that\nfortune really belonged to him! he is Madeleine, the providence of a\nwhole countryside! he is Jean Valjean, Javert's savior! he is a hero! he\nis a saint!\"\n\n\"He's not a saint, and he's not a hero!\" said Thenardier. \"He's an\nassassin and a robber.\"\n\nAnd he added, in the tone of a man who begins to feel that he possesses\nsome authority:\n\n\"Let us be calm.\"\n\nRobber, assassin--those words which Marius thought had disappeared and\nwhich returned, fell upon him like an ice-cold shower-bath.\n\n\"Again!\" said he.\n\n\"Always,\" ejaculated Thenardier. \"Jean Valjean did not rob Madeleine,\nbut he is a thief. He did not kill Javert, but he is a murderer.\"\n\n\"Will you speak,\" retorted Marius, \"of that miserable theft, committed\nforty years ago, and expiated, as your own newspapers prove, by a whole\nlife of repentance, of self-abnegation and of virtue?\"\n\n\"I say assassination and theft, Monsieur le Baron, and I repeat that I\nam speaking of actual facts. What I have to reveal to you is absolutely\nunknown. It belongs to unpublished matter. And perhaps you will find in\nit the source of the fortune so skilfully presented to Madame la Baronne\nby Jean Valjean. I say skilfully, because, by a gift of that nature it\nwould not be so very unskilful to slip into an honorable house whose\ncomforts one would then share, and, at the same stroke, to conceal one's\ncrime, and to enjoy one's theft, to bury one's name and to create for\noneself a family.\"\n\n\"I might interrupt you at this point,\" said Marius, \"but go on.\"\n\n\"Monsieur le Baron, I will tell you all, leaving the recompense to your\ngenerosity. This secret is worth massive gold. You will say to me: 'Why\ndo not you apply to Jean Valjean?' For a very simple reason; I know\nthat he has stripped himself, and stripped himself in your favor, and I\nconsider the combination ingenious; but he has no longer a son, he would\nshow me his empty hands, and, since I am in need of some money for\nmy trip to la Joya, I prefer you, you who have it all, to him who has\nnothing. I am a little fatigued, permit me to take a chair.\"\n\nMarius seated himself and motioned to him to do the same.\n\nThenardier installed himself on a tufted chair, picked up his two\nnewspapers, thrust them back into their envelope, and murmured as he\npecked at the Drapeau Blanc with his nail: \"It cost me a good deal of\ntrouble to get this one.\"\n\nThat done he crossed his legs and stretched himself out on the back of\nthe chair, an attitude characteristic of people who are sure of what\nthey are saying, then he entered upon his subject gravely, emphasizing\nhis words:\n\n\"Monsieur le Baron, on the 6th of June, 1832, about a year ago, on the\nday of the insurrection, a man was in the Grand Sewer of Paris, at the\npoint where the sewer enters the Seine, between the Pont des Invalides\nand the Pont de Jena.\"\n\nMarius abruptly drew his chair closer to that of Thenardier. Thenardier\nnoticed this movement and continued with the deliberation of an orator\nwho holds his interlocutor and who feels his adversary palpitating under\nhis words:\n\n\"This man, forced to conceal himself, and for reasons, moreover, which\nare foreign to politics, had adopted the sewer as his domicile and had\na key to it. It was, I repeat, on the 6th of June; it might have been\neight o'clock in the evening. The man hears a noise in the sewer.\nGreatly surprised, he hides himself and lies in wait. It was the sound\nof footsteps, some one was walking in the dark, and coming in his\ndirection. Strange to say, there was another man in the sewer besides\nhimself. The grating of the outlet from the sewer was not far off.\nA little light which fell through it permitted him to recognize the\nnewcomer, and to see that the man was carrying something on his back.\nHe was walking in a bent attitude. The man who was walking in a bent\nattitude was an ex-convict, and what he was dragging on his shoulders\nwas a corpse. Assassination caught in the very act, if ever there was\nsuch a thing. As for the theft, that is understood; one does not kill\na man gratis. This convict was on his way to fling the body into the\nriver. One fact is to be noticed, that before reaching the exit\ngrating, this convict, who had come a long distance in the sewer, must,\nnecessarily, have encountered a frightful quagmire where it seems as\nthough he might have left the body, but the sewermen would have found\nthe assassinated man the very next day, while at work on the quagmire,\nand that did not suit the assassin's plans. He had preferred to\ntraverse that quagmire with his burden, and his exertions must have been\nterrible, for it is impossible to risk one's life more completely; I\ndon't understand how he could have come out of that alive.\"\n\nMarius' chair approached still nearer. Thenardier took advantage of this\nto draw a long breath. He went on:\n\n\"Monsieur le Baron, a sewer is not the Champ de Mars. One lacks\neverything there, even room. When two men are there, they must meet.\nThat is what happened. The man domiciled there and the passer-by were\nforced to bid each other good-day, greatly to the regret of both. The\npasser-by said to the inhabitant:--\"You see what I have on my back, I\nmust get out, you have the key, give it to me.\" That convict was a man\nof terrible strength. There was no way of refusing. Nevertheless, the\nman who had the key parleyed, simply to gain time. He examined the dead\nman, but he could see nothing, except that the latter was young, well\ndressed, with the air of being rich, and all disfigured with blood.\nWhile talking, the man contrived to tear and pull off behind, without\nthe assassin perceiving it, a bit of the assassinated man's coat. A\ndocument for conviction, you understand; a means of recovering the trace\nof things and of bringing home the crime to the criminal. He put\nthis document for conviction in his pocket. After which he opened the\ngrating, made the man go out with his embarrassment on his back, closed\nthe grating again, and ran off, not caring to be mixed up with the\nremainder of the adventure and above all, not wishing to be present\nwhen the assassin threw the assassinated man into the river. Now you\ncomprehend. The man who was carrying the corpse was Jean Valjean; the\none who had the key is speaking to you at this moment; and the piece of\nthe coat . . .\"\n\nThenardier completed his phrase by drawing from his pocket, and holding,\non a level with his eyes, nipped between his two thumbs and his two\nforefingers, a strip of torn black cloth, all covered with dark spots.\n\nMarius had sprung to his feet, pale, hardly able to draw his breath,\nwith his eyes riveted on the fragment of black cloth, and, without\nuttering a word, without taking his eyes from that fragment, he\nretreated to the wall and fumbled with his right hand along the wall for\na key which was in the lock of a cupboard near the chimney.\n\nHe found the key, opened the cupboard, plunged his arm into it without\nlooking, and without his frightened gaze quitting the rag which\nThenardier still held outspread.\n\nBut Thenardier continued:\n\n\"Monsieur le Baron, I have the strongest of reasons for believing that\nthe assassinated young man was an opulent stranger lured into a trap by\nJean Valjean, and the bearer of an enormous sum of money.\"\n\n\"The young man was myself, and here is the coat!\" cried Marius, and he\nflung upon the floor an old black coat all covered with blood.\n\nThen, snatching the fragment from the hands of Thenardier, he crouched\ndown over the coat, and laid the torn morsel against the tattered skirt.\nThe rent fitted exactly, and the strip completed the coat.\n\nThenardier was petrified.\n\nThis is what he thought: \"I'm struck all of a heap.\"\n\nMarius rose to his feet trembling, despairing, radiant.\n\nHe fumbled in his pocket and stalked furiously to Thenardier, presenting\nto him and almost thrusting in his face his fist filled with bank-notes\nfor five hundred and a thousand francs.\n\n\"You are an infamous wretch! you are a liar, a calumniator, a villain.\nYou came to accuse that man, you have only justified him; you wanted to\nruin him, you have only succeeded in glorifying him. And it is you who\nare the thief! And it is you who are the assassin! I saw you, Thenardier\nJondrette, in that lair on the Rue de l'Hopital. I know enough about\nyou to send you to the galleys and even further if I choose. Here are a\nthousand francs, bully that you are!\"\n\nAnd he flung a thousand franc note at Thenardier.\n\n\"Ah! Jondrette Thenardier, vile rascal! Let this serve you as a lesson,\nyou dealer in second-hand secrets, merchant of mysteries, rummager of\nthe shadows, wretch! Take these five hundred francs and get out of here!\nWaterloo protects you.\"\n\n\"Waterloo!\" growled Thenardier, pocketing the five hundred francs along\nwith the thousand.\n\n\"Yes, assassin! You there saved the life of a Colonel. . .\"\n\n\"Of a General,\" said Thenardier, elevating his head.\n\n\"Of a Colonel!\" repeated Marius in a rage. \"I wouldn't give a ha'penny\nfor a general. And you come here to commit infamies! I tell you that\nyou have committed all crimes. Go! disappear! Only be happy, that is all\nthat I desire. Ah! monster! here are three thousand francs more. Take\nthem. You will depart to-morrow, for America, with your daughter;\nfor your wife is dead, you abominable liar. I shall watch over your\ndeparture, you ruffian, and at that moment I will count out to you\ntwenty thousand francs. Go get yourself hung elsewhere!\"\n\n\"Monsieur le Baron!\" replied Thenardier, bowing to the very earth,\n\"eternal gratitude.\" And Thenardier left the room, understanding\nnothing, stupefied and delighted with this sweet crushing beneath sacks\nof gold, and with that thunder which had burst forth over his head in\nbank-bills.\n\nStruck by lightning he was, but he was also content; and he would\nhave been greatly angered had he had a lightning rod to ward off such\nlightning as that.\n\nLet us finish with this man at once.\n\nTwo days after the events which we are at this moment narrating, he set\nout, thanks to Marius' care, for America under a false name, with his\ndaughter Azelma, furnished with a draft on New York for twenty thousand\nfrancs.\n\nThe moral wretchedness of Thenardier, the bourgeois who had missed\nhis vocation, was irremediable. He was in America what he had been in\nEurope. Contact with an evil man sometimes suffices to corrupt a good\naction and to cause evil things to spring from it. With Marius' money,\nThenardier set up as a slave-dealer.\n\nAs soon as Thenardier had left the house, Marius rushed to the garden,\nwhere Cosette was still walking.\n\n\"Cosette! Cosette!\" he cried. \"Come! come quick! Let us go. Basque, a\ncarriage! Cosette, come. Ah! My God! It was he who saved my life! Let us\nnot lose a minute! Put on your shawl.\"\n\nCosette thought him mad and obeyed.\n\nHe could not breathe, he laid his hand on his heart to restrain its\nthrobbing. He paced back and forth with huge strides, he embraced\nCosette:\n\n\"Ah! Cosette! I am an unhappy wretch!\" said he.\n\nMarius was bewildered. He began to catch a glimpse in Jean Valjean of\nsome indescribably lofty and melancholy figure. An unheard-of virtue,\nsupreme and sweet, humble in its immensity, appeared to him. The convict\nwas transfigured into Christ.\n\nMarius was dazzled by this prodigy. He did not know precisely what he\nbeheld, but it was grand.\n\nIn an instant, a hackney-carriage stood in front of the door.\n\nMarius helped Cosette in and darted in himself.\n\n\"Driver,\" said he, \"Rue de l'Homme Arme, Number 7.\"\n\nThe carriage drove off.\n\n\"Ah! what happiness!\" ejaculated Cosette. \"Rue de l'Homme Arme, I did\nnot dare to speak to you of that. We are going to see M. Jean.\"\n\n\"Thy father! Cosette, thy father more than ever. Cosette, I guess it.\nYou told me that you had never received the letter that I sent you by\nGavroche. It must have fallen into his hands. Cosette, he went to the\nbarricade to save me. As it is a necessity with him to be an angel, he\nsaved others also; he saved Javert. He rescued me from that gulf to give\nme to you. He carried me on his back through that frightful sewer. Ah! I\nam a monster of ingratitude. Cosette, after having been your providence,\nhe became mine. Just imagine, there was a terrible quagmire enough to\ndrown one a hundred times over, to drown one in mire. Cosette! he made\nme traverse it. I was unconscious; I saw nothing, I heard nothing, I\ncould know nothing of my own adventure. We are going to bring him back,\nto take him with us, whether he is willing or not, he shall never leave\nus again. If only he is at home! Provided only that we can find him,\nI will pass the rest of my life in venerating him. Yes, that is how it\nshould be, do you see, Cosette? Gavroche must have delivered my letter\nto him. All is explained. You understand.\"\n\nCosette did not understand a word.\n\n\"You are right,\" she said to him.\n\nMeanwhile the carriage rolled on.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V--A NIGHT BEHIND WHICH THERE IS DAY\n\nJean Valjean turned round at the knock which he heard on his door.\n\n\"Come in,\" he said feebly.\n\nThe door opened.\n\nCosette and Marius made their appearance.\n\nCosette rushed into the room.\n\nMarius remained on the threshold, leaning against the jamb of the door.\n\n\"Cosette!\" said Jean Valjean.\n\nAnd he sat erect in his chair, his arms outstretched and trembling,\nhaggard, livid, gloomy, an immense joy in his eyes.\n\nCosette, stifling with emotion, fell upon Jean Valjean's breast.\n\n\"Father!\" said she.\n\nJean Valjean, overcome, stammered:\n\n\"Cosette! she! you! Madame! it is thou! Ah! my God!\"\n\nAnd, pressed close in Cosette's arms, he exclaimed:\n\n\"It is thou! thou art here! Thou dost pardon me then!\"\n\nMarius, lowering his eyelids, in order to keep his tears from flowing,\ntook a step forward and murmured between lips convulsively contracted to\nrepress his sobs:\n\n\"My father!\"\n\n\"And you also, you pardon me!\" Jean Valjean said to him.\n\nMarius could find no words, and Jean Valjean added:\n\n\"Thanks.\"\n\nCosette tore off her shawl and tossed her hat on the bed.\n\n\"It embarrasses me,\" said she.\n\nAnd, seating herself on the old man's knees, she put aside his white\nlocks with an adorable movement, and kissed his brow.\n\nJean Valjean, bewildered, let her have her own way.\n\nCosette, who only understood in a very confused manner, redoubled her\ncaresses, as though she desired to pay Marius' debt.\n\nJean Valjean stammered:\n\n\"How stupid people are! I thought that I should never see her again.\nImagine, Monsieur Pontmercy, at the very moment when you entered, I\nwas saying to myself: 'All is over. Here is her little gown, I am a\nmiserable man, I shall never see Cosette again,' and I was saying that\nat the very moment when you were mounting the stairs. Was not I an\nidiot? Just see how idiotic one can be! One reckons without the good\nGod. The good God says:\n\n\"'You fancy that you are about to be abandoned, stupid! No. No, things\nwill not go so. Come, there is a good man yonder who is in need of an\nangel.' And the angel comes, and one sees one's Cosette again! and one\nsees one's little Cosette once more! Ah! I was very unhappy.\"\n\nFor a moment he could not speak, then he went on:\n\n\"I really needed to see Cosette a little bit now and then. A heart needs\na bone to gnaw. But I was perfectly conscious that I was in the way. I\ngave myself reasons: 'They do not want you, keep in your own course,\none has not the right to cling eternally.' Ah! God be praised, I see her\nonce more! Dost thou know, Cosette, thy husband is very handsome? Ah!\nwhat a pretty embroidered collar thou hast on, luckily. I am fond of\nthat pattern. It was thy husband who chose it, was it not? And then,\nthou shouldst have some cashmere shawls. Let me call her thou, Monsieur\nPontmercy. It will not be for long.\"\n\nAnd Cosette began again:\n\n\"How wicked of you to have left us like that! Where did you go? Why have\nyou stayed away so long? Formerly your journeys only lasted three or\nfour days. I sent Nicolette, the answer always was: 'He is absent.' How\nlong have you been back? Why did you not let us know? Do you know that\nyou are very much changed? Ah! what a naughty father! he has been ill,\nand we have not known it! Stay, Marius, feel how cold his hand is!\"\n\n\"So you are here! Monsieur Pontmercy, you pardon me!\" repeated Jean\nValjean.\n\nAt that word which Jean Valjean had just uttered once more, all that was\nswelling Marius' heart found vent.\n\nHe burst forth:\n\n\"Cosette, do you hear? he has come to that! he asks my forgiveness! And\ndo you know what he has done for me, Cosette? He has saved my life. He\nhas done more--he has given you to me. And after having saved me, and\nafter having given you to me, Cosette, what has he done with himself? He\nhas sacrificed himself. Behold the man. And he says to me the ingrate,\nto me the forgetful, to me the pitiless, to me the guilty one: Thanks!\nCosette, my whole life passed at the feet of this man would be too\nlittle. That barricade, that sewer, that furnace, that cesspool,--all\nthat he traversed for me, for thee, Cosette! He carried me away through\nall the deaths which he put aside before me, and accepted for himself.\nEvery courage, every virtue, every heroism, every sanctity he possesses!\nCosette, that man is an angel!\"\n\n\"Hush! hush!\" said Jean Valjean in a low voice. \"Why tell all that?\"\n\n\"But you!\" cried Marius with a wrath in which there was veneration, \"why\ndid you not tell it to me? It is your own fault, too. You save people's\nlives, and you conceal it from them! You do more, under the pretext of\nunmasking yourself, you calumniate yourself. It is frightful.\"\n\n\"I told the truth,\" replied Jean Valjean.\n\n\"No,\" retorted Marius, \"the truth is the whole truth; and that you did\nnot tell. You were Monsieur Madeleine, why not have said so? You saved\nJavert, why not have said so? I owed my life to you, why not have said\nso?\"\n\n\"Because I thought as you do. I thought that you were in the right. It\nwas necessary that I should go away. If you had known about that affair,\nof the sewer, you would have made me remain near you. I was therefore\nforced to hold my peace. If I had spoken, it would have caused\nembarrassment in every way.\"\n\n\"It would have embarrassed what? embarrassed whom?\" retorted Marius. \"Do\nyou think that you are going to stay here? We shall carry you off. Ah!\ngood heavens! when I reflect that it was by an accident that I have\nlearned all this. You form a part of ourselves. You are her father,\nand mine. You shall not pass another day in this dreadful house. Do not\nimagine that you will be here to-morrow.\"\n\n\"To-morrow,\" said Jean Valjean, \"I shall not be here, but I shall not be\nwith you.\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\" replied Marius. \"Ah! come now, we are not going to\npermit any more journeys. You shall never leave us again. You belong to\nus. We shall not loose our hold of you.\"\n\n\"This time it is for good,\" added Cosette. \"We have a carriage at the\ndoor. I shall run away with you. If necessary, I shall employ force.\"\n\nAnd she laughingly made a movement to lift the old man in her arms.\n\n\"Your chamber still stands ready in our house,\" she went on. \"If you\nonly knew how pretty the garden is now! The azaleas are doing very\nwell there. The walks are sanded with river sand; there are tiny violet\nshells. You shall eat my strawberries. I water them myself. And no\nmore 'madame,' no more 'Monsieur Jean,' we are living under a Republic,\neverybody says thou, don't they, Marius? The programme is changed. If\nyou only knew, father, I have had a sorrow, there was a robin redbreast\nwhich had made her nest in a hole in the wall, and a horrible cat ate\nher. My poor, pretty, little robin red-breast which used to put her head\nout of her window and look at me! I cried over it. I should have liked\nto kill the cat. But now nobody cries any more. Everybody laughs,\neverybody is happy. You are going to come with us. How delighted\ngrandfather will be! You shall have your plot in the garden, you shall\ncultivate it, and we shall see whether your strawberries are as fine as\nmine. And, then, I shall do everything that you wish, and then, you will\nobey me prettily.\"\n\nJean Valjean listened to her without hearing her. He heard the music of\nher voice rather than the sense of her words; one of those large tears\nwhich are the sombre pearls of the soul welled up slowly in his eyes.\n\nHe murmured:\n\n\"The proof that God is good is that she is here.\"\n\n\"Father!\" said Cosette.\n\nJean Valjean continued:\n\n\"It is quite true that it would be charming for us to live together.\nTheir trees are full of birds. I would walk with Cosette. It is sweet to\nbe among living people who bid each other 'good-day,' who call to each\nother in the garden. People see each other from early morning. We\nshould each cultivate our own little corner. She would make me eat her\nstrawberries. I would make her gather my roses. That would be charming.\nOnly . . .\"\n\nHe paused and said gently:\n\n\"It is a pity.\"\n\nThe tear did not fall, it retreated, and Jean Valjean replaced it with a\nsmile.\n\nCosette took both the old man's hands in hers.\n\n\"My God!\" said she, \"your hands are still colder than before. Are you\nill? Do you suffer?\"\n\n\"I? No,\" replied Jean Valjean. \"I am very well. Only . . .\"\n\nHe paused.\n\n\"Only what?\"\n\n\"I am going to die presently.\"\n\nCosette and Marius shuddered.\n\n\"To die!\" exclaimed Marius.\n\n\"Yes, but that is nothing,\" said Jean Valjean.\n\nHe took breath, smiled and resumed:\n\n\"Cosette, thou wert talking to me, go on, so thy little robin red-breast\nis dead? Speak, so that I may hear thy voice.\"\n\nMarius gazed at the old man in amazement.\n\nCosette uttered a heartrending cry.\n\n\"Father! my father! you will live. You are going to live. I insist upon\nyour living, do you hear?\"\n\nJean Valjean raised his head towards her with adoration.\n\n\"Oh! yes, forbid me to die. Who knows? Perhaps I shall obey. I was on\nthe verge of dying when you came. That stopped me, it seemed to me that\nI was born again.\"\n\n\"You are full of strength and life,\" cried Marius. \"Do you imagine that\na person can die like this? You have had sorrow, you shall have no more.\nIt is I who ask your forgiveness, and on my knees! You are going to\nlive, and to live with us, and to live a long time. We take possession\nof you once more. There are two of us here who will henceforth have no\nother thought than your happiness.\"\n\n\"You see,\" resumed Cosette, all bathed in tears, \"that Marius says that\nyou shall not die.\"\n\nJean Valjean continued to smile.\n\n\"Even if you were to take possession of me, Monsieur Pontmercy, would\nthat make me other than I am? No, God has thought like you and myself,\nand he does not change his mind; it is useful for me to go. Death is\na good arrangement. God knows better than we what we need. May you be\nhappy, may Monsieur Pontmercy have Cosette, may youth wed the morning,\nmay there be around you, my children, lilacs and nightingales; may your\nlife be a beautiful, sunny lawn, may all the enchantments of heaven fill\nyour souls, and now let me, who am good for nothing, die; it is certain\nthat all this is right. Come, be reasonable, nothing is possible now, I\nam fully conscious that all is over. And then, last night, I drank that\nwhole jug of water. How good thy husband is, Cosette! Thou art much\nbetter off with him than with me.\"\n\nA noise became audible at the door.\n\nIt was the doctor entering.\n\n\"Good-day, and farewell, doctor,\" said Jean Valjean. \"Here are my poor\nchildren.\"\n\nMarius stepped up to the doctor. He addressed to him only this single\nword: \"Monsieur? . . .\" But his manner of pronouncing it contained a\ncomplete question.\n\nThe doctor replied to the question by an expressive glance.\n\n\"Because things are not agreeable,\" said Jean Valjean, \"that is no\nreason for being unjust towards God.\"\n\nA silence ensued.\n\nAll breasts were oppressed.\n\nJean Valjean turned to Cosette. He began to gaze at her as though he\nwished to retain her features for eternity.\n\nIn the depths of the shadow into which he had already descended, ecstasy\nwas still possible to him when gazing at Cosette. The reflection of that\nsweet face lighted up his pale visage.\n\nThe doctor felt of his pulse.\n\n\"Ah! it was you that he wanted!\" he murmured, looking at Cosette and\nMarius.\n\nAnd bending down to Marius' ear, he added in a very low voice:\n\n\"Too late.\"\n\nJean Valjean surveyed the doctor and Marius serenely, almost without\nceasing to gaze at Cosette.\n\nThese barely articulate words were heard to issue from his mouth:\n\n\"It is nothing to die; it is dreadful not to live.\"\n\nAll at once he rose to his feet. These accesses of strength are\nsometimes the sign of the death agony. He walked with a firm step to\nthe wall, thrusting aside Marius and the doctor who tried to help him,\ndetached from the wall a little copper crucifix which was suspended\nthere, and returned to his seat with all the freedom of movement of\nperfect health, and said in a loud voice, as he laid the crucifix on the\ntable:\n\n\"Behold the great martyr.\"\n\nThen his chest sank in, his head wavered, as though the intoxication of\nthe tomb were seizing hold upon him.\n\nHis hands, which rested on his knees, began to press their nails into\nthe stuff of his trousers.\n\nCosette supported his shoulders, and sobbed, and tried to speak to him,\nbut could not.\n\nAmong the words mingled with that mournful saliva which accompanies\ntears, they distinguished words like the following:\n\n\"Father, do not leave us. Is it possible that we have found you only to\nlose you again?\"\n\nIt might be said that agony writhes. It goes, comes, advances towards\nthe sepulchre, and returns towards life. There is groping in the action\nof dying.\n\nJean Valjean rallied after this semi-swoon, shook his brow as though\nto make the shadows fall away from it and became almost perfectly lucid\nonce more.\n\nHe took a fold of Cosette's sleeve and kissed it.\n\n\"He is coming back! doctor, he is coming back,\" cried Marius.\n\n\"You are good, both of you,\" said Jean Valjean. \"I am going to tell you\nwhat has caused me pain. What has pained me, Monsieur Pontmercy, is that\nyou have not been willing to touch that money. That money really belongs\nto your wife. I will explain to you, my children, and for that reason,\nalso, I am glad to see you. Black jet comes from England, white jet\ncomes from Norway. All this is in this paper, which you will read. For\nbracelets, I invented a way of substituting for slides of soldered sheet\niron, slides of iron laid together. It is prettier, better and less\ncostly. You will understand how much money can be made in that way. So\nCosette's fortune is really hers. I give you these details, in order\nthat your mind may be set at rest.\"\n\nThe portress had come upstairs and was gazing in at the half-open door.\nThe doctor dismissed her.\n\nBut he could not prevent this zealous woman from exclaiming to the dying\nman before she disappeared: \"Would you like a priest?\"\n\n\"I have had one,\" replied Jean Valjean.\n\nAnd with his finger he seemed to indicate a point above his head where\none would have said that he saw some one.\n\nIt is probable, in fact, that the Bishop was present at this death\nagony.\n\nCosette gently slipped a pillow under his loins.\n\nJean Valjean resumed:\n\n\"Have no fear, Monsieur Pontmercy, I adjure you. The six hundred\nthousand francs really belong to Cosette. My life will have been wasted\nif you do not enjoy them! We managed to do very well with those glass\ngoods. We rivalled what is called Berlin jewellery. However, we could\nnot equal the black glass of England. A gross, which contains twelve\nhundred very well cut grains, only costs three francs.\"\n\nWhen a being who is dear to us is on the point of death, we gaze upon\nhim with a look which clings convulsively to him and which would fain\nhold him back.\n\nCosette gave her hand to Marius, and both, mute with anguish, not\nknowing what to say to the dying man, stood trembling and despairing\nbefore him.\n\nJean Valjean sank moment by moment. He was failing; he was drawing near\nto the gloomy horizon.\n\nHis breath had become intermittent; a little rattling interrupted it.\nHe found some difficulty in moving his forearm, his feet had lost all\nmovement, and in proportion as the wretchedness of limb and feebleness\nof body increased, all the majesty of his soul was displayed and spread\nover his brow. The light of the unknown world was already visible in his\neyes.\n\nHis face paled and smiled. Life was no longer there, it was something\nelse.\n\nHis breath sank, his glance grew grander. He was a corpse on which the\nwings could be felt.\n\nHe made a sign to Cosette to draw near, then to Marius; the last minute\nof the last hour had, evidently, arrived.\n\nHe began to speak to them in a voice so feeble that it seemed to come\nfrom a distance, and one would have said that a wall now rose between\nthem and him.\n\n\"Draw near, draw near, both of you. I love you dearly. Oh! how good it\nis to die like this! And thou lovest me also, my Cosette. I knew well\nthat thou still felt friendly towards thy poor old man. How kind it was\nof thee to place that pillow under my loins! Thou wilt weep for me a\nlittle, wilt thou not? Not too much. I do not wish thee to have any real\ngriefs. You must enjoy yourselves a great deal, my children. I forgot\nto tell you that the profit was greater still on the buckles without\ntongues than on all the rest. A gross of a dozen dozens cost ten francs\nand sold for sixty. It really was a good business. So there is no\noccasion for surprise at the six hundred thousand francs, Monsieur\nPontmercy. It is honest money. You may be rich with a tranquil mind.\nThou must have a carriage, a box at the theatres now and then, and\nhandsome ball dresses, my Cosette, and then, thou must give good dinners\nto thy friends, and be very happy. I was writing to Cosette a while ago.\nShe will find my letter. I bequeath to her the two candlesticks which\nstand on the chimney-piece. They are of silver, but to me they are gold,\nthey are diamonds; they change candles which are placed in them into\nwax-tapers. I do not know whether the person who gave them to me is\npleased with me yonder on high. I have done what I could. My children,\nyou will not forget that I am a poor man, you will have me buried in the\nfirst plot of earth that you find, under a stone to mark the spot. This\nis my wish. No name on the stone. If Cosette cares to come for a little\nwhile now and then, it will give me pleasure. And you too, Monsieur\nPontmercy. I must admit that I have not always loved you. I ask your\npardon for that. Now she and you form but one for me. I feel very\ngrateful to you. I am sure that you make Cosette happy. If you only\nknew, Monsieur Pontmercy, her pretty rosy cheeks were my delight; when I\nsaw her in the least pale, I was sad. In the chest of drawers, there is\na bank-bill for five hundred francs. I have not touched it. It is for\nthe poor. Cosette, dost thou see thy little gown yonder on the bed? dost\nthou recognize it? That was ten years ago, however. How time flies! We\nhave been very happy. All is over. Do not weep, my children, I am not\ngoing very far, I shall see you from there, you will only have to\nlook at night, and you will see me smile. Cosette, dost thou remember\nMontfermeil? Thou wert in the forest, thou wert greatly terrified; dost\nthou remember how I took hold of the handle of the water-bucket? That\nwas the first time that I touched thy poor, little hand. It was so cold!\nAh! your hands were red then, mademoiselle, they are very white now. And\nthe big doll! dost thou remember? Thou didst call her Catherine. Thou\nregrettedest not having taken her to the convent! How thou didst make\nme laugh sometimes, my sweet angel! When it had been raining, thou didst\nfloat bits of straw on the gutters, and watch them pass away. One day\nI gave thee a willow battledore and a shuttlecock with yellow, blue and\ngreen feathers. Thou hast forgotten it. Thou wert roguish so young! Thou\ndidst play. Thou didst put cherries in thy ears. Those are things of\nthe past. The forests through which one has passed with one's child, the\ntrees under which one has strolled, the convents where one has concealed\noneself, the games, the hearty laughs of childhood, are shadows. I\nimagined that all that belonged to me. In that lay my stupidity. Those\nThenardiers were wicked. Thou must forgive them. Cosette, the moment\nhas come to tell thee the name of thy mother. She was called Fantine.\nRemember that name--Fantine. Kneel whenever thou utterest it. She\nsuffered much. She loved thee dearly. She had as much unhappiness as\nthou hast had happiness. That is the way God apportions things. He is\nthere on high, he sees us all, and he knows what he does in the midst of\nhis great stars. I am on the verge of departure, my children. Love each\nother well and always. There is nothing else but that in the world: love\nfor each other. You will think sometimes of the poor old man who died\nhere. Oh my Cosette, it is not my fault, indeed, that I have not seen\nthee all this time, it cut me to the heart; I went as far as the corner\nof the street, I must have produced a queer effect on the people who\nsaw me pass, I was like a madman, I once went out without my hat. I no\nlonger see clearly, my children, I had still other things to say, but\nnever mind. Think a little of me. Come still nearer. I die happy. Give\nme your dear and well-beloved heads, so that I may lay my hands upon\nthem.\"\n\nCosette and Marius fell on their knees, in despair, suffocating with\ntears, each beneath one of Jean Valjean's hands. Those august hands no\nlonger moved.\n\nHe had fallen backwards, the light of the candles illuminated him.\n\nHis white face looked up to heaven, he allowed Cosette and Marius to\ncover his hands with kisses.\n\nHe was dead.\n\nThe night was starless and extremely dark. No doubt, in the gloom, some\nimmense angel stood erect with wings outspread, awaiting that soul.\n\n[Illustration: Darkness  5b9-1-Darkness]\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI--THE GRASS COVERS AND THE RAIN EFFACES\n\nIn the cemetery of Pere-Lachaise, in the vicinity of the common grave,\nfar from the elegant quarter of that city of sepulchres, far from all\nthe tombs of fancy which display in the presence of eternity all the\nhideous fashions of death, in a deserted corner, beside an old wall,\nbeneath a great yew tree over which climbs the wild convolvulus, amid\ndandelions and mosses, there lies a stone. That stone is no more exempt\nthan others from the leprosy of time, of dampness, of the lichens and\nfrom the defilement of the birds. The water turns it green, the air\nblackens it. It is not near any path, and people are not fond of\nwalking in that direction, because the grass is high and their feet\nare immediately wet. When there is a little sunshine, the lizards\ncome thither. All around there is a quivering of weeds. In the spring,\nlinnets warble in the trees.\n\nThis stone is perfectly plain. In cutting it the only thought was the\nrequirements of the tomb, and no other care was taken than to make the\nstone long enough and narrow enough to cover a man.\n\nNo name is to be read there.\n\nOnly, many years ago, a hand wrote upon it in pencil these four lines,\nwhich have become gradually illegible beneath the rain and the dust, and\nwhich are, to-day, probably effaced:\n\n           Il dort. Quoique le sort fut pour lui bien etrange,\n           Il vivait. Il mourut quand il n'eut plus son ange.\n           La chose simplement d'elle-meme arriva,\n           Comme la nuit se fait lorsque le jour s'en va.[70]\n\n\n\n\n\nLETTER TO M. DAELLI\n\nPublisher of the Italian translation of Les Miserables in Milan.\n\n                               HAUTEVILLE-HOUSE, October 18, 1862.\n\n\nYou are right, sir, when you tell me that Les Miserables is written for\nall nations. I do not know whether it will be read by all, but I wrote\nit for all. It is addressed to England as well as to Spain, to Italy as\nwell as to France, to Germany as well as to Ireland, to Republics which\nhave slaves as well as to Empires which have serfs. Social problems\noverstep frontiers. The sores of the human race, those great sores which\ncover the globe, do not halt at the red or blue lines traced upon the\nmap. In every place where man is ignorant and despairing, in every place\nwhere woman is sold for bread, wherever the child suffers for lack of\nthe book which should instruct him and of the hearth which should warm\nhim, the book of Les Miserables knocks at the door and says: \"Open to\nme, I come for you.\"\n\nAt the hour of civilization through which we are now passing, and which\nis still so sombre, the miserable's name is Man; he is agonizing in all\nclimes, and he is groaning in all languages.\n\nYour Italy is no more exempt from the evil than is our France. Your\nadmirable Italy has all miseries on the face of it. Does not banditism,\nthat raging form of pauperism, inhabit your mountains? Few nations are\nmore deeply eaten by that ulcer of convents which I have endeavored to\nfathom. In spite of your possessing Rome, Milan, Naples, Palermo, Turin,\nFlorence, Sienna, Pisa, Mantua, Bologna, Ferrara, Genoa, Venice, a\nheroic history, sublime ruins, magnificent ruins, and superb cities,\nyou are, like ourselves, poor. You are covered with marvels and vermin.\nAssuredly, the sun of Italy is splendid, but, alas, azure in the sky\ndoes not prevent rags on man.\n\nLike us, you have prejudices, superstitions, tyrannies, fanaticisms,\nblind laws lending assistance to ignorant customs. You taste nothing of\nthe present nor of the future without a flavor of the past being mingled\nwith it. You have a barbarian, the monk, and a savage, the lazzarone.\nThe social question is the same for you as for us. There are a few less\ndeaths from hunger with you, and a few more from fever; your social\nhygiene is not much better than ours; shadows, which are Protestant in\nEngland, are Catholic in Italy; but, under different names, the vescovo\nis identical with the bishop, and it always means night, and of pretty\nnearly the same quality. To explain the Bible badly amounts to the same\nthing as to understand the Gospel badly.\n\nIs it necessary to emphasize this? Must this melancholy parallelism\nbe yet more completely verified? Have you not indigent persons? Glance\nbelow. Have you not parasites? Glance up. Does not that hideous balance,\nwhose two scales, pauperism and parasitism, so mournfully preserve their\nmutual equilibrium, oscillate before you as it does before us? Where\nis your army of schoolmasters, the only army which civilization\nacknowledges?\n\nWhere are your free and compulsory schools? Does every one know how to\nread in the land of Dante and of Michael Angelo? Have you made public\nschools of your barracks? Have you not, like ourselves, an opulent\nwar-budget and a paltry budget of education? Have not you also that\npassive obedience which is so easily converted into soldierly obedience?\nmilitary establishment which pushes the regulations to the extreme of\nfiring upon Garibaldi; that is to say, upon the living honor of Italy?\nLet us subject your social order to examination, let us take it where it\nstands and as it stands, let us view its flagrant offences, show me the\nwoman and the child. It is by the amount of protection with which these\ntwo feeble creatures are surrounded that the degree of civilization\nis to be measured. Is prostitution less heartrending in Naples than in\nParis? What is the amount of truth that springs from your laws, and what\namount of justice springs from your tribunals? Do you chance to be so\nfortunate as to be ignorant of the meaning of those gloomy words: public\nprosecution, legal infamy, prison, the scaffold, the executioner, the\ndeath penalty? Italians, with you as with us, Beccaria is dead and\nFarinace is alive. And then, let us scrutinize your state reasons.\nHave you a government which comprehends the identity of morality and\npolitics? You have reached the point where you grant amnesty to heroes!\nSomething very similar has been done in France. Stay, let us pass\nmiseries in review, let each one contribute his pile, you are as rich\nas we. Have you not, like ourselves, two condemnations, religious\ncondemnation pronounced by the priest, and social condemnation decreed\nby the judge? Oh, great nation of Italy, thou resemblest the great\nnation of France! Alas! our brothers, you are, like ourselves,\nMiserables.\n\nFrom the depths of the gloom wherein you dwell, you do not see much more\ndistinctly than we the radiant and distant portals of Eden. Only, the\npriests are mistaken. These holy portals are before and not behind us.\n\nI resume. This book, Les Miserables, is no less your mirror than ours.\nCertain men, certain castes, rise in revolt against this book,--I\nunderstand that. Mirrors, those revealers of the truth, are hated; that\ndoes not prevent them from being of use.\n\nAs for myself, I have written for all, with a profound love for my own\ncountry, but without being engrossed by France more than by any other\nnation. In proportion as I advance in life, I grow more simple, and I\nbecome more and more patriotic for humanity.\n\nThis is, moreover, the tendency of our age, and the law of radiance\nof the French Revolution; books must cease to be exclusively French,\nItalian, German, Spanish, or English, and become European, I say more,\nhuman, if they are to correspond to the enlargement of civilization.\n\nHence a new logic of art, and of certain requirements of composition\nwhich modify everything, even the conditions, formerly narrow, of taste\nand language, which must grow broader like all the rest.\n\nIn France, certain critics have reproached me, to my great delight,\nwith having transgressed the bounds of what they call \"French taste\"; I\nshould be glad if this eulogium were merited.\n\nIn short, I am doing what I can, I suffer with the same universal\nsuffering, and I try to assuage it, I possess only the puny forces of a\nman, and I cry to all: \"Help me!\"\n\nThis, sir, is what your letter prompts me to say; I say it for you and\nfor your country. If I have insisted so strongly, it is because of one\nphrase in your letter. You write:--\n\n\"There are Italians, and they are numerous, who say: 'This book, Les\nMiserables, is a French book. It does not concern us. Let the French\nread it as a history, we read it as a romance.'\"--Alas! I repeat,\nwhether we be Italians or Frenchmen, misery concerns us all. Ever since\nhistory has been written, ever since philosophy has meditated, misery\nhas been the garment of the human race; the moment has at length arrived\nfor tearing off that rag, and for replacing, upon the naked limbs of the\nMan-People, the sinister fragment of the past with the grand purple robe\nof the dawn.\n\nIf this letter seems to you of service in enlightening some minds and\nin dissipating some prejudices, you are at liberty to publish it,\nsir. Accept, I pray you, a renewed assurance of my very distinguished\nsentiments.\n\n                                                  VICTOR HUGO.\n\n\n*****\n\nFOOTNOTES:\n\n\n[Footnote 1: Patois of the French Alps: chat de maraude, rascally\nmarauder.]\n\n[Footnote 2: Liege: a cork-tree.

How good she smells!\nWhat billowing hair! Beneath her mantle she hides a wing. Her charming\nbonnet is hardly unfolded. I wandered with thee, pressing thy supple\narm. The passers-by thought that love bewitched had wedded, in our happy\ncouple, the gentle month of April to the fair month of May. We lived\nconcealed, content, with closed doors, devouring love, that sweet\nforbidden fruit. My mouth had not uttered a thing when thy heart had\nalready responded.

I have read\na great deal of Plato, but nothing of it remains by me; better than\nMalebranche and then Lamennais thou didst demonstrate to me celestial\ngoodness with a flower which thou gavest to me, I obeyed thee, thou\ndidst submit to me; oh gilded garret! to lace thee! to behold thee going\nand coming from dawn in thy chemise, gazing at thy young brow in thine\nancient mirror! And who, then, would forego the memory of those days of\naurora and the firmament, of flowers, of gauze and of moire, when love\nstammers a charming slang? Our gardens consisted of a pot of tulips;\nthou didst mask the window with thy petticoat; I took the earthenware\nbowl and I gave thee the Japanese cup. And those great misfortunes which\nmade us laugh! Thy cuff scorched, thy boa lost! And that dear portrait\nof the divine Shakespeare which we sold one evening that we might sup! I\nwas a beggar and thou wert charitable. I kissed thy fresh round arms\nin haste. A folio Dante served us as a table on which to eat merrily a\ncentime's worth of chestnuts. The first time that, in my joyous den, I\nsnatched a kiss from thy fiery lip, when thou wentest forth, dishevelled\nand blushing, I turned deathly pale and I believed in God. Dost thou\nrecall our innumerable joys, and all those fichus changed to rags? Oh!\nwhat sighs from our hearts full of gloom fluttered forth to the heavenly\ndepths!]\n\n[Footnote 54: My nose is in tears, my friend Bugeaud, lend me thy\ngendarmes that I may say a word to them.

The jades are very charming, their poison which\nbewitched me would intoxicate Monsieur Orfila. I'm fond of love and its\nbickerings, I love Agnes, I love Pamela, Lise burned herself in setting\nme aflame. In former days when I saw the mantillas of Suzette and of\nZeila, my soul mingled with their folds. Love, when thou gleamest in\nthe dark thou crownest Lola with roses, I would lose my soul for that.\nJeanne, at thy mirror thou deckest thyself! One fine day, my heart flew\nforth. I think that it is Jeanne who has it. At night, when I come from\nthe quadrilles, I show Stella to the stars, and I say to them: \"Behold\nher.\" Where fair maids go, lon la.]\n\n\n[Footnote 57: But some prisons still remain, and I am going to put\na stop to this sort of public order.
