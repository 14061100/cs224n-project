{"summary": "Gabriel John Utterson, a lawyer, is on his weekly walk with his cousin, Richard Enfield. During that walk, they reach a door leading into a rather large house, and this motivates Enfield to tell Utterson of an encounter he had seen some months ago while coming home late at night between a man and a young girl. The man, a sinister figure named Edward Hyde, and a young girl, who has run to get a doctor, accidentally bump into one another, but Hyde proceeds to trample her. Enfield chases after Hyde, brings him back to the scene, and, after the doctor assures them that the girl is okay, though frightened, joins with the girl's family in forcing Hyde to pay £100 to avoid the scandal they will otherwise spread for his despicable behaviour. Hyde leads them to the building in front of which Enfield and Utterson have now paused, where he disappears, and re-emerges with £10 in gold and a cheque for the rest, drawn on the account of a reputable gentleman. (This gentleman is later revealed to be Dr. Henry Jekyll, one of Utterson's clients and old friends.) Jekyll had recently so draughted his will as to make Hyde the sole beneficiary in case of his death or—much to Utterson's disturbance—his disappearance for more than three months. This development concerns and disturbs Utterson, who makes an effort to seek out Hyde, fearing that Hyde is blackmailing Jekyll. When he finally sees Hyde, the latter's ugliness, as if deformed, amazes Utterson. Although Utterson cannot say exactly how or why, Hyde provokes an instinctive feeling of revulsion in him. Much to Utterson's surprise, Hyde willingly offers Utterson his address. After one of Jekyll's dinner parties, Utterson stays behind to discuss the matter of Hyde with Jekyll. This causes Jekyll to turn pale, which Utterson notices. Yet Jekyll assures Utterson that everything involving Hyde is in order and that Hyde should be left alone.\nA year passes uneventfully. One night in late October, a servant girl witnesses Hyde beat a man to death with a heavy cane. The victim was MP Sir Danvers Carew, another of Utterson's clients, who was carrying a letter addressed to Utterson when he was killed. The police, who suspect Hyde, contact Utterson. He leads the officers to Hyde's apartment, feeling a sense of foreboding amid the eerie weather. (The morning is dark and wreathed in fog.) When they arrive at the apartment, the murderer has vanished, but they find half of the cane (described as being made of a strong wood but broken due to the beating) left behind a door. It is revealed to be one which Utterson himself gave to Jekyll. Shortly thereafter, Utterson again visits Jekyll, who now claims to have ended all relations with Hyde. Jekyll shows Utterson a note, allegedly written to Jekyll by Hyde, apologising for the trouble that he has caused him and saying goodbye. That night, however, Utterson's clerk, Mr. Guest, points out that Hyde's handwriting bears a remarkable similarity to Jekyll's own.\nFor two months, Jekyll reverts to his former friendly and sociable manner, as if a weight has been lifted from his shoulders. But in early January, Jekyll suddenly starts refusing visitors, and Dr. Hastie Lanyon, a mutual acquaintance of Jekyll and Utterson, dies suddenly of shock after receiving information relating to Jekyll. Before his death, Lanyon gives Utterson a letter, with instructions that he should only open it after Jekyll's death or his disappearance. In late February, Utterson goes out walking with Enfield, and they see Jekyll at a window of his laboratory. The three men start conversing, but a look of horror suddenly comes over Jekyll's face, and he slams the window and disappears. Soon afterwards, in early March, Jekyll's butler, Mr. Poole, visits Utterson in a state of desperation and explains that Jekyll has secluded himself in his laboratory for several weeks. Utterson and Poole travel to Jekyll's house through empty, windswept, sinister streets. Once there, they find the servants huddled together in fear. They go to see the laboratory where they hear that the voice coming from inside is not the voice of Jekyll and the footsteps are light and not the heavy footsteps of the doctor. After arguing for a time, the two of them resolve to break into Jekyll's laboratory.\nInside, they find the body of Hyde wearing Jekyll's clothes and apparently dead from suicide. They find also, as the second of three enclosures within a large envelope, a letter from Jekyll to Utterson promising to explain the entire mystery. (The first is a re-draughted will which disinherits Edward Hyde and names Gabriel John Utterson sole residuary legatee.) Utterson takes the document, the third enclosure, back to his home, where he first reads Lanyon's letter and then Jekyll's. The first reveals that Lanyon's deterioration and eventual death resulted from the shock of seeing Hyde drinking a serum (potion or \"draught\") and, as a result of doing so, turning into Dr. Jekyll. The second letter explains that Jekyll, having previously indulged unstated vices (and with it the fear that discovery would lead to his losing his social position) found a way to transform himself (writing of \"the most racking pangs\" accompanying this transformation) and thereby indulge his vices without fear of detection. But Jekyll's transformed personality, Hyde, was effectively a sociopath—evil, self-indulgent, and utterly uncaring to anyone but himself. Initially, Jekyll was able to control the transformations, but one night in August, he became Hyde involuntarily in his sleep.\nAt this point, Jekyll resolved to cease becoming Hyde. On the October night of Sir Danvers Carew's murder, however, the urge gripped him too strongly, and after the transformation he immediately rushed out and violently killed Sir Danvers. Horrified, Jekyll tried more adamantly to stop the transformations, and for a time he proved successful by engaging in philanthropic work. One day in early January, at a park, he considered how good a person he had become as a result of his deeds in comparison to others, believing himself redeemed. However, before he completed his line of thought, he was seized by sensations of agony; once they had faded, he looked down at his hands and realised that he had suddenly transformed once again into Hyde. This was the first time that an involuntary metamorphosis had happened in waking hours. Far from the chemicals in his laboratory and now hunted by the police as a murderer, Hyde needed help to avoid being caught. He wrote to Lanyon (in Jekyll's hand), asking his friend to retrieve the contents of a cabinet in his laboratory and to meet him at midnight at Lanyon's home in Cavendish Square. In Lanyon's presence, Hyde mixed the chemicals, drank the draught, and transformed back into Jekyll. The shock of the sight, for which Lanyon condemned Jekyll and declared the two former friends irredeemably estranged, instigated Lanyon's deterioration and death. Meanwhile, Jekyll returned to his home, only to find himself ever more helpless and trapped as the transformations increased in frequency and necessitated even larger doses of the draught to reverse them. It was the onset of one of these spontaneous metamorphoses that caused Jekyll to slam his laboratory window shut in the middle of his conversation with Enfield and Utterson.\nEventually, one of the medicinal chemicals from which Jekyll had been preparing the draught ran low, and subsequent batches prepared by Jekyll from renewed stocks failed to produce the transformation. Jekyll speculated that the one essential ingredient that made the original draught work (a salt) must have itself been contaminated. After sending his butler Poole to one chemist after another, to purchase the salt that was running low, only to find it ineffective, he assumed that subsequent supplies all lacked the essential ingredient that made the draught successful for his experiments. His ability to change back from Hyde into Jekyll had slowly vanished in consequence. In March, as he inscribed his \"confession,\" Jekyll wrote that even as he composed his letter, he knew that he would soon become Hyde permanently, having used the last of this salt, and he wondered if Hyde would face execution for his crimes or choose to kill himself. Jekyll noted that, in either case, the end of his letter marked the end of the life of Dr. Jekyll. He ended the letter by saying, \"I bring the life of that unhappy Henry Jekyll to an end.\" With these words, both the document and the novella come to a close.\n\n", "full_text": "THE STRANGE CASE OF DR. JEKYLL AND MR. HYDE\n\nby Robert Louis Stevenson\n\n\n\n\nSTORY OF THE DOOR\n\n\nMr. Utterson the lawyer was a man of a rugged countenance that was never\nlighted by a smile; cold, scanty and embarrassed in discourse; backward\nin sentiment; lean, long, dusty, dreary and yet somehow lovable.\nAt friendly meetings, and when the wine was to his taste, something\neminently human beaconed from his eye; something indeed which never\nfound its way into his talk, but which spoke not only in these silent\nsymbols of the after-dinner face, but more often and loudly in the acts\nof his life. He was austere with himself; drank gin when he was alone,\nto mortify a taste for vintages; and though he enjoyed the theatre, had\nnot crossed the doors of one for twenty years. But he had an approved\ntolerance for others; sometimes wondering, almost with envy, at the high\npressure of spirits involved in their misdeeds; and in any extremity\ninclined to help rather than to reprove. \"I incline to Cain's heresy,\"\nhe used to say quaintly: \"I let my brother go to the devil in his own\nway.\" In this character, it was frequently his fortune to be the last\nreputable acquaintance and the last good influence in the lives of\ndowngoing men. And to such as these, so long as they came about his\nchambers, he never marked a shade of change in his demeanour.\n\nNo doubt the feat was easy to Mr. Utterson; for he was undemonstrative\nat the best, and even his friendship seemed to be founded in a similar\ncatholicity of good-nature. It is the mark of a modest man to accept his\nfriendly circle ready-made from the hands of opportunity; and that was\nthe lawyer's way. His friends were those of his own blood or those whom\nhe had known the longest; his affections, like ivy, were the growth of\ntime, they implied no aptness in the object. Hence, no doubt the\nbond that united him to Mr. Richard Enfield, his distant kinsman, the\nwell-known man about town. It was a nut to crack for many, what these\ntwo could see in each other, or what subject they could find in common.\nIt was reported by those who encountered them in their Sunday walks,\nthat they said nothing, looked singularly dull and would hail with\nobvious relief the appearance of a friend. For all that, the two men put\nthe greatest store by these excursions, counted them the chief jewel\nof each week, and not only set aside occasions of pleasure, but\neven resisted the calls of business, that they might enjoy them\nuninterrupted.\n\nIt chanced on one of these rambles that their way led them down a\nby-street in a busy quarter of London. The street was small and what\nis called quiet, but it drove a thriving trade on the weekdays. The\ninhabitants were all doing well, it seemed and all emulously hoping to\ndo better still, and laying out the surplus of their grains in coquetry;\nso that the shop fronts stood along that thoroughfare with an air of\ninvitation, like rows of smiling saleswomen. Even on Sunday, when it\nveiled its more florid charms and lay comparatively empty of passage,\nthe street shone out in contrast to its dingy neighbourhood, like a\nfire in a forest; and with its freshly painted shutters, well-polished\nbrasses, and general cleanliness and gaiety of note, instantly caught\nand pleased the eye of the passenger.\n\nTwo doors from one corner, on the left hand going east the line was\nbroken by the entry of a court; and just at that point a certain\nsinister block of building thrust forward its gable on the street. It\nwas two storeys high; showed no window, nothing but a door on the lower\nstorey and a blind forehead of discoloured wall on the upper; and bore\nin every feature, the marks of prolonged and sordid negligence. The\ndoor, which was equipped with neither bell nor knocker, was blistered\nand distained. Tramps slouched into the recess and struck matches on the\npanels; children kept shop upon the steps; the schoolboy had tried\nhis knife on the mouldings; and for close on a generation, no one had\nappeared to drive away these random visitors or to repair their ravages.\n\nMr. Enfield and the lawyer were on the other side of the by-street; but\nwhen they came abreast of the entry, the former lifted up his cane and\npointed.\n\n\"Did you ever remark that door?\" he asked; and when his companion had\nreplied in the affirmative. \"It is connected in my mind,\" added he,\n\"with a very odd story.\"\n\n\"Indeed?\" said Mr. Utterson, with a slight change of voice, \"and what\nwas that?\"\n\n\"Well, it was this way,\" returned Mr. Enfield: \"I was coming home from\nsome place at the end of the world, about three o'clock of a black\nwinter morning, and my way lay through a part of town where there was\nliterally nothing to be seen but lamps. Street after street and all the\nfolks asleep--street after street, all lighted up as if for a procession\nand all as empty as a church--till at last I got into that state of mind\nwhen a man listens and listens and begins to long for the sight of a\npoliceman. All at once, I saw two figures: one a little man who was\nstumping along eastward at a good walk, and the other a girl of maybe\neight or ten who was running as hard as she was able down a cross\nstreet. Well, sir, the two ran into one another naturally enough at\nthe corner; and then came the horrible part of the thing; for the man\ntrampled calmly over the child's body and left her screaming on the\nground. It sounds nothing to hear, but it was hellish to see. It wasn't\nlike a man; it was like some damned Juggernaut. I gave a few halloa,\ntook to my heels, collared my gentleman, and brought him back to where\nthere was already quite a group about the screaming child. He was\nperfectly cool and made no resistance, but gave me one look, so ugly\nthat it brought out the sweat on me like running. The people who had\nturned out were the girl's own family; and pretty soon, the doctor, for\nwhom she had been sent put in his appearance. Well, the child was not\nmuch the worse, more frightened, according to the Sawbones; and there\nyou might have supposed would be an end to it. But there was one curious\ncircumstance. I had taken a loathing to my gentleman at first sight. So\nhad the child's family, which was only natural. But the doctor's case\nwas what struck me. He was the usual cut and dry apothecary, of no\nparticular age and colour, with a strong Edinburgh accent and about as\nemotional as a bagpipe. Well, sir, he was like the rest of us; every\ntime he looked at my prisoner, I saw that Sawbones turn sick and white\nwith desire to kill him. I knew what was in his mind, just as he knew\nwhat was in mine; and killing being out of the question, we did the next\nbest. We told the man we could and would make such a scandal out of this\nas should make his name stink from one end of London to the other. If\nhe had any friends or any credit, we undertook that he should lose them.\nAnd all the time, as we were pitching it in red hot, we were keeping the\nwomen off him as best we could for they were as wild as harpies. I never\nsaw a circle of such hateful faces; and there was the man in the middle,\nwith a kind of black sneering coolness--frightened too, I could see\nthat--but carrying it off, sir, really like Satan. `If you choose to\nmake capital out of this accident,' said he, `I am naturally helpless.\nNo gentleman but wishes to avoid a scene,' says he. `Name your figure.'\nWell, we screwed him up to a hundred pounds for the child's family; he\nwould have clearly liked to stick out; but there was something about the\nlot of us that meant mischief, and at last he struck. The next thing was\nto get the money; and where do you think he carried us but to that place\nwith the door?--whipped out a key, went in, and presently came back\nwith the matter of ten pounds in gold and a cheque for the balance on\nCoutts's, drawn payable to bearer and signed with a name that I can't\nmention, though it's one of the points of my story, but it was a name at\nleast very well known and often printed. The figure was stiff; but the\nsignature was good for more than that if it was only genuine. I took the\nliberty of pointing out to my gentleman that the whole business looked\napocryphal, and that a man does not, in real life, walk into a cellar\ndoor at four in the morning and come out with another man's cheque for\nclose upon a hundred pounds. But he was quite easy and sneering. `Set\nyour mind at rest,' says he, `I will stay with you till the banks open\nand cash the cheque myself.' So we all set off, the doctor, and the\nchild's father, and our friend and myself, and passed the rest of the\nnight in my chambers; and next day, when we had breakfasted, went in\na body to the bank. I gave in the cheque myself, and said I had every\nreason to believe it was a forgery. Not a bit of it. The cheque was\ngenuine.\"\n\n\"Tut-tut,\" said Mr. Utterson.\n\n\"I see you feel as I do,\" said Mr. Enfield. \"Yes, it's a bad story. For\nmy man was a fellow that nobody could have to do with, a really damnable\nman; and the person that drew the cheque is the very pink of the\nproprieties, celebrated too, and (what makes it worse) one of your\nfellows who do what they call good. Black mail I suppose; an honest man\npaying through the nose for some of the capers of his youth. Black Mail\nHouse is what I call the place with the door, in consequence. Though\neven that, you know, is far from explaining all,\" he added, and with the\nwords fell into a vein of musing.\n\nFrom this he was recalled by Mr. Utterson asking rather suddenly: \"And\nyou don't know if the drawer of the cheque lives there?\"\n\n\"A likely place, isn't it?\" returned Mr. Enfield. \"But I happen to have\nnoticed his address; he lives in some square or other.\"\n\n\"And you never asked about the--place with the door?\" said Mr. Utterson.\n\n\"No, sir: I had a delicacy,\" was the reply. \"I feel very strongly about\nputting questions; it partakes too much of the style of the day of\njudgment. You start a question, and it's like starting a stone. You sit\nquietly on the top of a hill; and away the stone goes, starting others;\nand presently some bland old bird (the last you would have thought of)\nis knocked on the head in his own back garden and the family have to\nchange their name. No sir, I make it a rule of mine: the more it looks\nlike Queer Street, the less I ask.\"\n\n\"A very good rule, too,\" said the lawyer.\n\n\"But I have studied the place for myself,\" continued Mr. Enfield. \"It\nseems scarcely a house. There is no other door, and nobody goes in\nor out of that one but, once in a great while, the gentleman of my\nadventure. There are three windows looking on the court on the first\nfloor; none below; the windows are always shut but they're clean. And\nthen there is a chimney which is generally smoking; so somebody must\nlive there. And yet it's not so sure; for the buildings are so packed\ntogether about the court, that it's hard to say where one ends and\nanother begins.\"\n\nThe pair walked on again for a while in silence; and then \"Enfield,\"\nsaid Mr. Utterson, \"that's a good rule of yours.\"\n\n\"Yes, I think it is,\" returned Enfield.\n\n\"But for all that,\" continued the lawyer, \"there's one point I want to\nask: I want to ask the name of that man who walked over the child.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Mr. Enfield, \"I can't see what harm it would do. It was a\nman of the name of Hyde.\"\n\n\"Hm,\" said Mr. Utterson. \"What sort of a man is he to see?\"\n\n\"He is not easy to describe. There is something wrong with his\nappearance; something displeasing, something down-right detestable. I\nnever saw a man I so disliked, and yet I scarce know why. He must be\ndeformed somewhere; he gives a strong feeling of deformity, although I\ncouldn't specify the point. He's an extraordinary looking man, and yet\nI really can name nothing out of the way. No, sir; I can make no hand of\nit; I can't describe him. And it's not want of memory; for I declare I\ncan see him this moment.\"\n\nMr. Utterson again walked some way in silence and obviously under a\nweight of consideration. \"You are sure he used a key?\" he inquired at\nlast.\n\n\"My dear sir...\" began Enfield, surprised out of himself.\n\n\"Yes, I know,\" said Utterson; \"I know it must seem strange. The fact is,\nif I do not ask you the name of the other party, it is because I know\nit already. You see, Richard, your tale has gone home. If you have been\ninexact in any point you had better correct it.\"\n\n\"I think you might have warned me,\" returned the other with a touch of\nsullenness. \"But I have been pedantically exact, as you call it. The\nfellow had a key; and what's more, he has it still. I saw him use it not\na week ago.\"\n\nMr. Utterson sighed deeply but said never a word; and the young man\npresently resumed. \"Here is another lesson to say nothing,\" said he. \"I\nam ashamed of my long tongue. Let us make a bargain never to refer to\nthis again.\"\n\n\"With all my heart,\" said the lawyer. \"I shake hands on that, Richard.\"\n\n\n\n\nSEARCH FOR MR. HYDE\n\n\nThat evening Mr. Utterson came home to his bachelor house in sombre\nspirits and sat down to dinner without relish. It was his custom of a\nSunday, when this meal was over, to sit close by the fire, a volume\nof some dry divinity on his reading desk, until the clock of the\nneighbouring church rang out the hour of twelve, when he would go\nsoberly and gratefully to bed. On this night however, as soon as the\ncloth was taken away, he took up a candle and went into his business\nroom. There he opened his safe, took from the most private part of it a\ndocument endorsed on the envelope as Dr. Jekyll's Will and sat down with\na clouded brow to study its contents. The will was holograph, for Mr.\nUtterson though he took charge of it now that it was made, had refused\nto lend the least assistance in the making of it; it provided not only\nthat, in case of the decease of Henry Jekyll, M.D., D.C.L., L.L.D.,\nF.R.S., etc., all his possessions were to pass into the hands of his\n\"friend and benefactor Edward Hyde,\" but that in case of Dr. Jekyll's\n\"disappearance or unexplained absence for any period exceeding three\ncalendar months,\" the said Edward Hyde should step into the said Henry\nJekyll's shoes without further delay and free from any burthen or\nobligation beyond the payment of a few small sums to the members of the\ndoctor's household. This document had long been the lawyer's eyesore. It\noffended him both as a lawyer and as a lover of the sane and customary\nsides of life, to whom the fanciful was the immodest. And hitherto it\nwas his ignorance of Mr. Hyde that had swelled his indignation; now, by\na sudden turn, it was his knowledge. It was already bad enough when the\nname was but a name of which he could learn no more. It was worse when\nit began to be clothed upon with detestable attributes; and out of the\nshifting, insubstantial mists that had so long baffled his eye, there\nleaped up the sudden, definite presentment of a fiend.\n\n\"I thought it was madness,\" he said, as he replaced the obnoxious paper\nin the safe, \"and now I begin to fear it is disgrace.\"\n\nWith that he blew out his candle, put on a greatcoat, and set forth in\nthe direction of Cavendish Square, that citadel of medicine, where his\nfriend, the great Dr. Lanyon, had his house and received his crowding\npatients. \"If anyone knows, it will be Lanyon,\" he had thought.\n\nThe solemn butler knew and welcomed him; he was subjected to no stage\nof delay, but ushered direct from the door to the dining-room where\nDr. Lanyon sat alone over his wine. This was a hearty, healthy, dapper,\nred-faced gentleman, with a shock of hair prematurely white, and a\nboisterous and decided manner. At sight of Mr. Utterson, he sprang up\nfrom his chair and welcomed him with both hands. The geniality, as was\nthe way of the man, was somewhat theatrical to the eye; but it reposed\non genuine feeling. For these two were old friends, old mates both at\nschool and college, both thorough respectors of themselves and of each\nother, and what does not always follow, men who thoroughly enjoyed each\nother's company.\n\nAfter a little rambling talk, the lawyer led up to the subject which so\ndisagreeably preoccupied his mind.\n\n\"I suppose, Lanyon,\" said he, \"you and I must be the two oldest friends\nthat Henry Jekyll has?\"\n\n\"I wish the friends were younger,\" chuckled Dr. Lanyon. \"But I suppose\nwe are. And what of that? I see little of him now.\"\n\n\"Indeed?\" said Utterson. \"I thought you had a bond of common interest.\"\n\n\"We had,\" was the reply. \"But it is more than ten years since Henry\nJekyll became too fanciful for me. He began to go wrong, wrong in mind;\nand though of course I continue to take an interest in him for old\nsake's sake, as they say, I see and I have seen devilish little of the\nman. Such unscientific balderdash,\" added the doctor, flushing suddenly\npurple, \"would have estranged Damon and Pythias.\"\n\nThis little spirit of temper was somewhat of a relief to Mr. Utterson.\n\"They have only differed on some point of science,\" he thought;\nand being a man of no scientific passions (except in the matter of\nconveyancing), he even added: \"It is nothing worse than that!\" He gave\nhis friend a few seconds to recover his composure, and then approached\nthe question he had come to put. \"Did you ever come across a protege of\nhis--one Hyde?\" he asked.\n\n\"Hyde?\" repeated Lanyon. \"No. Never heard of him. Since my time.\"\n\nThat was the amount of information that the lawyer carried back with him\nto the great, dark bed on which he tossed to and fro, until the small\nhours of the morning began to grow large. It was a night of little ease\nto his toiling mind, toiling in mere darkness and beseiged by questions.\n\nSix o'clock struck on the bells of the church that was so conveniently\nnear to Mr. Utterson's dwelling, and still he was digging at the\nproblem. Hitherto it had touched him on the intellectual side alone; but\nnow his imagination also was engaged, or rather enslaved; and as he lay\nand tossed in the gross darkness of the night and the curtained room,\nMr. Enfield's tale went by before his mind in a scroll of lighted\npictures. He would be aware of the great field of lamps of a nocturnal\ncity; then of the figure of a man walking swiftly; then of a child\nrunning from the doctor's; and then these met, and that human Juggernaut\ntrod the child down and passed on regardless of her screams. Or else he\nwould see a room in a rich house, where his friend lay asleep, dreaming\nand smiling at his dreams; and then the door of that room would be\nopened, the curtains of the bed plucked apart, the sleeper recalled, and\nlo! there would stand by his side a figure to whom power was given, and\neven at that dead hour, he must rise and do its bidding. The figure in\nthese two phases haunted the lawyer all night; and if at any time he\ndozed over, it was but to see it glide more stealthily through sleeping\nhouses, or move the more swiftly and still the more swiftly, even to\ndizziness, through wider labyrinths of lamplighted city, and at every\nstreet corner crush a child and leave her screaming. And still the\nfigure had no face by which he might know it; even in his dreams, it had\nno face, or one that baffled him and melted before his eyes; and thus\nit was that there sprang up and grew apace in the lawyer's mind a\nsingularly strong, almost an inordinate, curiosity to behold the\nfeatures of the real Mr. Hyde. If he could but once set eyes on him, he\nthought the mystery would lighten and perhaps roll altogether away, as\nwas the habit of mysterious things when well examined. He might see a\nreason for his friend's strange preference or bondage (call it which you\nplease) and even for the startling clause of the will. At least it would\nbe a face worth seeing: the face of a man who was without bowels of\nmercy: a face which had but to show itself to raise up, in the mind of\nthe unimpressionable Enfield, a spirit of enduring hatred.\n\nFrom that time forward, Mr. Utterson began to haunt the door in the\nby-street of shops. In the morning before office hours, at noon when\nbusiness was plenty, and time scarce, at night under the face of\nthe fogged city moon, by all lights and at all hours of solitude or\nconcourse, the lawyer was to be found on his chosen post.\n\n\"If he be Mr. Hyde,\" he had thought, \"I shall be Mr. Seek.\"\n\nAnd at last his patience was rewarded. It was a fine dry night; frost in\nthe air; the streets as clean as a ballroom floor; the lamps, unshaken\nby any wind, drawing a regular pattern of light and shadow. By ten\no'clock, when the shops were closed the by-street was very solitary and,\nin spite of the low growl of London from all round, very silent. Small\nsounds carried far; domestic sounds out of the houses were clearly\naudible on either side of the roadway; and the rumour of the approach\nof any passenger preceded him by a long time. Mr. Utterson had been some\nminutes at his post, when he was aware of an odd light footstep drawing\nnear. In the course of his nightly patrols, he had long grown accustomed\nto the quaint effect with which the footfalls of a single person, while\nhe is still a great way off, suddenly spring out distinct from the vast\nhum and clatter of the city. Yet his attention had never before been so\nsharply and decisively arrested; and it was with a strong, superstitious\nprevision of success that he withdrew into the entry of the court.\n\nThe steps drew swiftly nearer, and swelled out suddenly louder as they\nturned the end of the street. The lawyer, looking forth from the entry,\ncould soon see what manner of man he had to deal with. He was small and\nvery plainly dressed and the look of him, even at that distance, went\nsomehow strongly against the watcher's inclination. But he made straight\nfor the door, crossing the roadway to save time; and as he came, he drew\na key from his pocket like one approaching home.\n\nMr. Utterson stepped out and touched him on the shoulder as he passed.\n\"Mr. Hyde, I think?\"\n\nMr. Hyde shrank back with a hissing intake of the breath. But his fear\nwas only momentary; and though he did not look the lawyer in the face,\nhe answered coolly enough: \"That is my name. What do you want?\"\n\n\"I see you are going in,\" returned the lawyer. \"I am an old friend of\nDr. Jekyll's--Mr. Utterson of Gaunt Street--you must have heard of my\nname; and meeting you so conveniently, I thought you might admit me.\"\n\n\"You will not find Dr. Jekyll; he is from home,\" replied Mr. Hyde,\nblowing in the key. And then suddenly, but still without looking up,\n\"How did you know me?\" he asked.\n\n\"On your side,\" said Mr. Utterson \"will you do me a favour?\"\n\n\"With pleasure,\" replied the other. \"What shall it be?\"\n\n\"Will you let me see your face?\" asked the lawyer.\n\nMr. Hyde appeared to hesitate, and then, as if upon some sudden\nreflection, fronted about with an air of defiance; and the pair stared\nat each other pretty fixedly for a few seconds. \"Now I shall know you\nagain,\" said Mr. Utterson. \"It may be useful.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" returned Mr. Hyde, \"It is as well we have met; and apropos, you\nshould have my address.\" And he gave a number of a street in Soho.\n\n\"Good God!\" thought Mr. Utterson, \"can he, too, have been thinking\nof the will?\" But he kept his feelings to himself and only grunted in\nacknowledgment of the address.\n\n\"And now,\" said the other, \"how did you know me?\"\n\n\"By description,\" was the reply.\n\n\"Whose description?\"\n\n\"We have common friends,\" said Mr. Utterson.\n\n\"Common friends,\" echoed Mr. Hyde, a little hoarsely. \"Who are they?\"\n\n\"Jekyll, for instance,\" said the lawyer.\n\n\"He never told you,\" cried Mr. Hyde, with a flush of anger. \"I did not\nthink you would have lied.\"\n\n\"Come,\" said Mr. Utterson, \"that is not fitting language.\"\n\nThe other snarled aloud into a savage laugh; and the next moment, with\nextraordinary quickness, he had unlocked the door and disappeared into\nthe house.\n\nThe lawyer stood awhile when Mr. Hyde had left him, the picture of\ndisquietude. Then he began slowly to mount the street, pausing every\nstep or two and putting his hand to his brow like a man in mental\nperplexity. The problem he was thus debating as he walked, was one of a\nclass that is rarely solved. Mr. Hyde was pale and dwarfish, he gave\nan impression of deformity without any nameable malformation, he had\na displeasing smile, he had borne himself to the lawyer with a sort of\nmurderous mixture of timidity and boldness, and he spoke with a husky,\nwhispering and somewhat broken voice; all these were points against\nhim, but not all of these together could explain the hitherto unknown\ndisgust, loathing and fear with which Mr. Utterson regarded him.\n\"There must be something else,\" said the perplexed gentleman. \"There\nis something more, if I could find a name for it. God bless me, the man\nseems hardly human! Something troglodytic, shall we say? or can it be\nthe old story of Dr. Fell? or is it the mere radiance of a foul soul\nthat thus transpires through, and transfigures, its clay continent? The\nlast, I think; for, O my poor old Harry Jekyll, if ever I read Satan's\nsignature upon a face, it is on that of your new friend.\"\n\nRound the corner from the by-street, there was a square of ancient,\nhandsome houses, now for the most part decayed from their high estate\nand let in flats and chambers to all sorts and conditions of men;\nmap-engravers, architects, shady lawyers and the agents of obscure\nenterprises. One house, however, second from the corner, was still\noccupied entire; and at the door of this, which wore a great air of\nwealth and comfort, though it was now plunged in darkness except for\nthe fanlight, Mr. Utterson stopped and knocked. A well-dressed, elderly\nservant opened the door.\n\n\"Is Dr. Jekyll at home, Poole?\" asked the lawyer.\n\n\"I will see, Mr. Utterson,\" said Poole, admitting the visitor, as he\nspoke, into a large, low-roofed, comfortable hall paved with flags,\nwarmed (after the fashion of a country house) by a bright, open fire,\nand furnished with costly cabinets of oak. \"Will you wait here by the\nfire, sir? or shall I give you a light in the dining-room?\"\n\n\"Here, thank you,\" said the lawyer, and he drew near and leaned on the\ntall fender. This hall, in which he was now left alone, was a pet fancy\nof his friend the doctor's; and Utterson himself was wont to speak of\nit as the pleasantest room in London. But tonight there was a shudder in\nhis blood; the face of Hyde sat heavy on his memory; he felt (what was\nrare with him) a nausea and distaste of life; and in the gloom of his\nspirits, he seemed to read a menace in the flickering of the firelight\non the polished cabinets and the uneasy starting of the shadow on the\nroof. He was ashamed of his relief, when Poole presently returned to\nannounce that Dr. Jekyll was gone out.\n\n\"I saw Mr. Hyde go in by the old dissecting room, Poole,\" he said. \"Is\nthat right, when Dr. Jekyll is from home?\"\n\n\"Quite right, Mr. Utterson, sir,\" replied the servant. \"Mr. Hyde has a\nkey.\"\n\n\"Your master seems to repose a great deal of trust in that young man,\nPoole,\" resumed the other musingly.\n\n\"Yes, sir, he does indeed,\" said Poole. \"We have all orders to obey\nhim.\"\n\n\"I do not think I ever met Mr. Hyde?\" asked Utterson.\n\n\"O, dear no, sir. He never dines here,\" replied the butler. \"Indeed we\nsee very little of him on this side of the house; he mostly comes and\ngoes by the laboratory.\"\n\n\"Well, good-night, Poole.\"\n\n\"Good-night, Mr. Utterson.\"\n\nAnd the lawyer set out homeward with a very heavy heart. \"Poor Harry\nJekyll,\" he thought, \"my mind misgives me he is in deep waters! He was\nwild when he was young; a long while ago to be sure; but in the law of\nGod, there is no statute of limitations. Ay, it must be that; the ghost\nof some old sin, the cancer of some concealed disgrace: punishment\ncoming, PEDE CLAUDO, years after memory has forgotten and self-love\ncondoned the fault.\" And the lawyer, scared by the thought, brooded\nawhile on his own past, groping in all the corners of memory, least\nby chance some Jack-in-the-Box of an old iniquity should leap to light\nthere. His past was fairly blameless; few men could read the rolls of\ntheir life with less apprehension; yet he was humbled to the dust by\nthe many ill things he had done, and raised up again into a sober and\nfearful gratitude by the many he had come so near to doing yet avoided.\nAnd then by a return on his former subject, he conceived a spark of\nhope. \"This Master Hyde, if he were studied,\" thought he, \"must have\nsecrets of his own; black secrets, by the look of him; secrets compared\nto which poor Jekyll's worst would be like sunshine. Things cannot\ncontinue as they are. It turns me cold to think of this creature\nstealing like a thief to Harry's bedside; poor Harry, what a wakening!\nAnd the danger of it; for if this Hyde suspects the existence of the\nwill, he may grow impatient to inherit. Ay, I must put my shoulders to\nthe wheel--if Jekyll will but let me,\" he added, \"if Jekyll will\nonly let me.\" For once more he saw before his mind's eye, as clear as\ntransparency, the strange clauses of the will.\n\n\n\n\n\nDR. JEKYLL WAS QUITE AT EASE\n\n\nA fortnight later, by excellent good fortune, the doctor gave one of\nhis pleasant dinners to some five or six old cronies, all intelligent,\nreputable men and all judges of good wine; and Mr. Utterson so contrived\nthat he remained behind after the others had departed. This was no new\narrangement, but a thing that had befallen many scores of times. Where\nUtterson was liked, he was liked well. Hosts loved to detain the dry\nlawyer, when the light-hearted and loose-tongued had already their foot\non the threshold; they liked to sit a while in his unobtrusive company,\npractising for solitude, sobering their minds in the man's rich silence\nafter the expense and strain of gaiety. To this rule, Dr. Jekyll was no\nexception; and as he now sat on the opposite side of the fire--a large,\nwell-made, smooth-faced man of fifty, with something of a stylish cast\nperhaps, but every mark of capacity and kindness--you could see by his\nlooks that he cherished for Mr. Utterson a sincere and warm affection.\n\n\"I have been wanting to speak to you, Jekyll,\" began the latter. \"You\nknow that will of yours?\"\n\nA close observer might have gathered that the topic was distasteful; but\nthe doctor carried it off gaily. \"My poor Utterson,\" said he, \"you are\nunfortunate in such a client. I never saw a man so distressed as you\nwere by my will; unless it were that hide-bound pedant, Lanyon, at what\nhe called my scientific heresies. O, I know he's a good fellow--you\nneedn't frown--an excellent fellow, and I always mean to see more of\nhim; but a hide-bound pedant for all that; an ignorant, blatant pedant.\nI was never more disappointed in any man than Lanyon.\"\n\n\"You know I never approved of it,\" pursued Utterson, ruthlessly\ndisregarding the fresh topic.\n\n\"My will? Yes, certainly, I know that,\" said the doctor, a trifle\nsharply. \"You have told me so.\"\n\n\"Well, I tell you so again,\" continued the lawyer. \"I have been learning\nsomething of young Hyde.\"\n\nThe large handsome face of Dr. Jekyll grew pale to the very lips, and\nthere came a blackness about his eyes. \"I do not care to hear more,\"\nsaid he. \"This is a matter I thought we had agreed to drop.\"\n\n\"What I heard was abominable,\" said Utterson.\n\n\"It can make no change. You do not understand my position,\" returned the\ndoctor, with a certain incoherency of manner. \"I am painfully situated,\nUtterson; my position is a very strange--a very strange one. It is one\nof those affairs that cannot be mended by talking.\"\n\n\"Jekyll,\" said Utterson, \"you know me: I am a man to be trusted. Make\na clean breast of this in confidence; and I make no doubt I can get you\nout of it.\"\n\n\"My good Utterson,\" said the doctor, \"this is very good of you, this\nis downright good of you, and I cannot find words to thank you in. I\nbelieve you fully; I would trust you before any man alive, ay, before\nmyself, if I could make the choice; but indeed it isn't what you fancy;\nit is not as bad as that; and just to put your good heart at rest, I\nwill tell you one thing: the moment I choose, I can be rid of Mr. Hyde.\nI give you my hand upon that; and I thank you again and again; and I\nwill just add one little word, Utterson, that I'm sure you'll take in\ngood part: this is a private matter, and I beg of you to let it sleep.\"\n\nUtterson reflected a little, looking in the fire.\n\n\"I have no doubt you are perfectly right,\" he said at last, getting to\nhis feet.\n\n\"Well, but since we have touched upon this business, and for the last\ntime I hope,\" continued the doctor, \"there is one point I should like\nyou to understand. I have really a very great interest in poor Hyde. I\nknow you have seen him; he told me so; and I fear he was rude. But I do\nsincerely take a great, a very great interest in that young man; and if\nI am taken away, Utterson, I wish you to promise me that you will bear\nwith him and get his rights for him. I think you would, if you knew all;\nand it would be a weight off my mind if you would promise.\"\n\n\"I can't pretend that I shall ever like him,\" said the lawyer.\n\n\"I don't ask that,\" pleaded Jekyll, laying his hand upon the other's\narm; \"I only ask for justice; I only ask you to help him for my sake,\nwhen I am no longer here.\"\n\nUtterson heaved an irrepressible sigh. \"Well,\" said he, \"I promise.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nTHE CAREW MURDER CASE\n\n\nNearly a year later, in the month of October, 18--, London was startled\nby a crime of singular ferocity and rendered all the more notable by the\nhigh position of the victim. The details were few and startling. A\nmaid servant living alone in a house not far from the river, had gone\nupstairs to bed about eleven. Although a fog rolled over the city in the\nsmall hours, the early part of the night was cloudless, and the lane,\nwhich the maid's window overlooked, was brilliantly lit by the full\nmoon. It seems she was romantically given, for she sat down upon her\nbox, which stood immediately under the window, and fell into a dream of\nmusing. Never (she used to say, with streaming tears, when she narrated\nthat experience), never had she felt more at peace with all men or\nthought more kindly of the world. And as she so sat she became aware\nof an aged beautiful gentleman with white hair, drawing near along the\nlane; and advancing to meet him, another and very small gentleman, to\nwhom at first she paid less attention. When they had come within speech\n(which was just under the maid's eyes) the older man bowed and accosted\nthe other with a very pretty manner of politeness. It did not seem as\nif the subject of his address were of great importance; indeed, from his\npointing, it some times appeared as if he were only inquiring his way;\nbut the moon shone on his face as he spoke, and the girl was pleased to\nwatch it, it seemed to breathe such an innocent and old-world kindness\nof disposition, yet with something high too, as of a well-founded\nself-content. Presently her eye wandered to the other, and she was\nsurprised to recognise in him a certain Mr. Hyde, who had once visited\nher master and for whom she had conceived a dislike. He had in his hand\na heavy cane, with which he was trifling; but he answered never a word,\nand seemed to listen with an ill-contained impatience. And then all of\na sudden he broke out in a great flame of anger, stamping with his foot,\nbrandishing the cane, and carrying on (as the maid described it) like\na madman. The old gentleman took a step back, with the air of one very\nmuch surprised and a trifle hurt; and at that Mr. Hyde broke out of\nall bounds and clubbed him to the earth. And next moment, with ape-like\nfury, he was trampling his victim under foot and hailing down a storm of\nblows, under which the bones were audibly shattered and the body jumped\nupon the roadway. At the horror of these sights and sounds, the maid\nfainted.\n\nIt was two o'clock when she came to herself and called for the police.\nThe murderer was gone long ago; but there lay his victim in the middle\nof the lane, incredibly mangled. The stick with which the deed had been\ndone, although it was of some rare and very tough and heavy wood, had\nbroken in the middle under the stress of this insensate cruelty; and\none splintered half had rolled in the neighbouring gutter--the other,\nwithout doubt, had been carried away by the murderer. A purse and gold\nwatch were found upon the victim: but no cards or papers, except a\nsealed and stamped envelope, which he had been probably carrying to the\npost, and which bore the name and address of Mr. Utterson.\n\nThis was brought to the lawyer the next morning, before he was out of\nbed; and he had no sooner seen it and been told the circumstances, than\nhe shot out a solemn lip. \"I shall say nothing till I have seen the\nbody,\" said he; \"this may be very serious. Have the kindness to wait\nwhile I dress.\" And with the same grave countenance he hurried through\nhis breakfast and drove to the police station, whither the body had been\ncarried. As soon as he came into the cell, he nodded.\n\n\"Yes,\" said he, \"I recognise him. I am sorry to say that this is Sir\nDanvers Carew.\"\n\n\"Good God, sir,\" exclaimed the officer, \"is it possible?\" And the next\nmoment his eye lighted up with professional ambition. \"This will make a\ndeal of noise,\" he said. \"And perhaps you can help us to the man.\" And\nhe briefly narrated what the maid had seen, and showed the broken stick.\n\nMr. Utterson had already quailed at the name of Hyde; but when the stick\nwas laid before him, he could doubt no longer; broken and battered as it\nwas, he recognized it for one that he had himself presented many years\nbefore to Henry Jekyll.\n\n\"Is this Mr. Hyde a person of small stature?\" he inquired.\n\n\"Particularly small and particularly wicked-looking, is what the maid\ncalls him,\" said the officer.\n\nMr. Utterson reflected; and then, raising his head, \"If you will come\nwith me in my cab,\" he said, \"I think I can take you to his house.\"\n\nIt was by this time about nine in the morning, and the first fog of the\nseason. A great chocolate-coloured pall lowered over heaven, but the\nwind was continually charging and routing these embattled vapours; so\nthat as the cab crawled from street to street, Mr. Utterson beheld a\nmarvelous number of degrees and hues of twilight; for here it would be\ndark like the back-end of evening; and there would be a glow of a rich,\nlurid brown, like the light of some strange conflagration; and here,\nfor a moment, the fog would be quite broken up, and a haggard shaft\nof daylight would glance in between the swirling wreaths. The dismal\nquarter of Soho seen under these changing glimpses, with its muddy\nways, and slatternly passengers, and its lamps, which had never\nbeen extinguished or had been kindled afresh to combat this mournful\nreinvasion of darkness, seemed, in the lawyer's eyes, like a district of\nsome city in a nightmare. The thoughts of his mind, besides, were of the\ngloomiest dye; and when he glanced at the companion of his drive, he\nwas conscious of some touch of that terror of the law and the law's\nofficers, which may at times assail the most honest.\n\nAs the cab drew up before the address indicated, the fog lifted a little\nand showed him a dingy street, a gin palace, a low French eating house,\na shop for the retail of penny numbers and twopenny salads, many ragged\nchildren huddled in the doorways, and many women of many different\nnationalities passing out, key in hand, to have a morning glass; and\nthe next moment the fog settled down again upon that part, as brown as\number, and cut him off from his blackguardly surroundings. This was the\nhome of Henry Jekyll's favourite; of a man who was heir to a quarter of\na million sterling.\n\nAn ivory-faced and silvery-haired old woman opened the door. She had an\nevil face, smoothed by hypocrisy: but her manners were excellent. Yes,\nshe said, this was Mr. Hyde's, but he was not at home; he had been in\nthat night very late, but he had gone away again in less than an hour;\nthere was nothing strange in that; his habits were very irregular, and\nhe was often absent; for instance, it was nearly two months since she\nhad seen him till yesterday.\n\n\"Very well, then, we wish to see his rooms,\" said the lawyer; and when\nthe woman began to declare it was impossible, \"I had better tell you\nwho this person is,\" he added. \"This is Inspector Newcomen of Scotland\nYard.\"\n\nA flash of odious joy appeared upon the woman's face. \"Ah!\" said she,\n\"he is in trouble! What has he done?\"\n\nMr. Utterson and the inspector exchanged glances. \"He don't seem a very\npopular character,\" observed the latter. \"And now, my good woman, just\nlet me and this gentleman have a look about us.\"\n\nIn the whole extent of the house, which but for the old woman remained\notherwise empty, Mr. Hyde had only used a couple of rooms; but these\nwere furnished with luxury and good taste. A closet was filled with\nwine; the plate was of silver, the napery elegant; a good picture hung\nupon the walls, a gift (as Utterson supposed) from Henry Jekyll, who was\nmuch of a connoisseur; and the carpets were of many plies and agreeable\nin colour. At this moment, however, the rooms bore every mark of having\nbeen recently and hurriedly ransacked; clothes lay about the floor,\nwith their pockets inside out; lock-fast drawers stood open; and on the\nhearth there lay a pile of grey ashes, as though many papers had been\nburned. From these embers the inspector disinterred the butt end of a\ngreen cheque book, which had resisted the action of the fire; the other\nhalf of the stick was found behind the door; and as this clinched his\nsuspicions, the officer declared himself delighted. A visit to the bank,\nwhere several thousand pounds were found to be lying to the murderer's\ncredit, completed his gratification.\n\n\"You may depend upon it, sir,\" he told Mr. Utterson: \"I have him in my\nhand. He must have lost his head, or he never would have left the stick\nor, above all, burned the cheque book. Why, money's life to the man.\nWe have nothing to do but wait for him at the bank, and get out the\nhandbills.\"\n\nThis last, however, was not so easy of accomplishment; for Mr. Hyde had\nnumbered few familiars--even the master of the servant maid had only\nseen him twice; his family could nowhere be traced; he had never been\nphotographed; and the few who could describe him differed widely, as\ncommon observers will. Only on one point were they agreed; and that\nwas the haunting sense of unexpressed deformity with which the fugitive\nimpressed his beholders.\n\n\n\n\nINCIDENT OF THE LETTER\n\n\nIt was late in the afternoon, when Mr. Utterson found his way to Dr.\nJekyll's door, where he was at once admitted by Poole, and carried down\nby the kitchen offices and across a yard which had once been a garden,\nto the building which was indifferently known as the laboratory or\ndissecting rooms. The doctor had bought the house from the heirs of\na celebrated surgeon; and his own tastes being rather chemical than\nanatomical, had changed the destination of the block at the bottom of\nthe garden. It was the first time that the lawyer had been received in\nthat part of his friend's quarters; and he eyed the dingy, windowless\nstructure with curiosity, and gazed round with a distasteful sense of\nstrangeness as he crossed the theatre, once crowded with eager\nstudents and now lying gaunt and silent, the tables laden with chemical\napparatus, the floor strewn with crates and littered with packing straw,\nand the light falling dimly through the foggy cupola. At the further\nend, a flight of stairs mounted to a door covered with red baize;\nand through this, Mr. Utterson was at last received into the doctor's\ncabinet. It was a large room fitted round with glass presses, furnished,\namong other things, with a cheval-glass and a business table, and\nlooking out upon the court by three dusty windows barred with iron. The\nfire burned in the grate; a lamp was set lighted on the chimney shelf,\nfor even in the houses the fog began to lie thickly; and there, close up\nto the warmth, sat Dr. Jekyll, looking deathly sick. He did not rise\nto meet his visitor, but held out a cold hand and bade him welcome in a\nchanged voice.\n\n\"And now,\" said Mr. Utterson, as soon as Poole had left them, \"you have\nheard the news?\"\n\nThe doctor shuddered. \"They were crying it in the square,\" he said. \"I\nheard them in my dining-room.\"\n\n\"One word,\" said the lawyer. \"Carew was my client, but so are you, and I\nwant to know what I am doing. You have not been mad enough to hide this\nfellow?\"\n\n\"Utterson, I swear to God,\" cried the doctor, \"I swear to God I will\nnever set eyes on him again. I bind my honour to you that I am done with\nhim in this world. It is all at an end. And indeed he does not want my\nhelp; you do not know him as I do; he is safe, he is quite safe; mark my\nwords, he will never more be heard of.\"\n\nThe lawyer listened gloomily; he did not like his friend's feverish\nmanner. \"You seem pretty sure of him,\" said he; \"and for your sake, I\nhope you may be right. If it came to a trial, your name might appear.\"\n\n\"I am quite sure of him,\" replied Jekyll; \"I have grounds for certainty\nthat I cannot share with any one. But there is one thing on which you\nmay advise me. I have--I have received a letter; and I am at a loss\nwhether I should show it to the police. I should like to leave it in\nyour hands, Utterson; you would judge wisely, I am sure; I have so great\na trust in you.\"\n\n\"You fear, I suppose, that it might lead to his detection?\" asked the\nlawyer.\n\n\"No,\" said the other. \"I cannot say that I care what becomes of Hyde; I\nam quite done with him. I was thinking of my own character, which this\nhateful business has rather exposed.\"\n\nUtterson ruminated awhile; he was surprised at his friend's selfishness,\nand yet relieved by it. \"Well,\" said he, at last, \"let me see the\nletter.\"\n\nThe letter was written in an odd, upright hand and signed \"Edward Hyde\":\nand it signified, briefly enough, that the writer's benefactor,\nDr. Jekyll, whom he had long so unworthily repaid for a thousand\ngenerosities, need labour under no alarm for his safety, as he had means\nof escape on which he placed a sure dependence. The lawyer liked this\nletter well enough; it put a better colour on the intimacy than he had\nlooked for; and he blamed himself for some of his past suspicions.\n\n\"Have you the envelope?\" he asked.\n\n\"I burned it,\" replied Jekyll, \"before I thought what I was about. But\nit bore no postmark. The note was handed in.\"\n\n\"Shall I keep this and sleep upon it?\" asked Utterson.\n\n\"I wish you to judge for me entirely,\" was the reply. \"I have lost\nconfidence in myself.\"\n\n\"Well, I shall consider,\" returned the lawyer. \"And now one word\nmore: it was Hyde who dictated the terms in your will about that\ndisappearance?\"\n\nThe doctor seemed seized with a qualm of faintness; he shut his mouth\ntight and nodded.\n\n\"I knew it,\" said Utterson. \"He meant to murder you. You had a fine\nescape.\"\n\n\"I have had what is far more to the purpose,\" returned the doctor\nsolemnly: \"I have had a lesson--O God, Utterson, what a lesson I have\nhad!\" And he covered his face for a moment with his hands.\n\nOn his way out, the lawyer stopped and had a word or two with Poole. \"By\nthe bye,\" said he, \"there was a letter handed in to-day: what was the\nmessenger like?\" But Poole was positive nothing had come except by post;\n\"and only circulars by that,\" he added.\n\nThis news sent off the visitor with his fears renewed. Plainly the\nletter had come by the laboratory door; possibly, indeed, it had been\nwritten in the cabinet; and if that were so, it must be differently\njudged, and handled with the more caution. The newsboys, as he went,\nwere crying themselves hoarse along the footways: \"Special edition.\nShocking murder of an M.P.\" That was the funeral oration of one friend\nand client; and he could not help a certain apprehension lest the good\nname of another should be sucked down in the eddy of the scandal. It\nwas, at least, a ticklish decision that he had to make; and self-reliant\nas he was by habit, he began to cherish a longing for advice. It was not\nto be had directly; but perhaps, he thought, it might be fished for.\n\nPresently after, he sat on one side of his own hearth, with Mr.\nGuest, his head clerk, upon the other, and midway between, at a nicely\ncalculated distance from the fire, a bottle of a particular old wine\nthat had long dwelt unsunned in the foundations of his house. The\nfog still slept on the wing above the drowned city, where the lamps\nglimmered like carbuncles; and through the muffle and smother of these\nfallen clouds, the procession of the town's life was still rolling in\nthrough the great arteries with a sound as of a mighty wind. But the\nroom was gay with firelight. In the bottle the acids were long ago\nresolved; the imperial dye had softened with time, as the colour grows\nricher in stained windows; and the glow of hot autumn afternoons on\nhillside vineyards, was ready to be set free and to disperse the fogs of\nLondon. Insensibly the lawyer melted. There was no man from whom he kept\nfewer secrets than Mr. Guest; and he was not always sure that he kept as\nmany as he meant. Guest had often been on business to the doctor's;\nhe knew Poole; he could scarce have failed to hear of Mr. Hyde's\nfamiliarity about the house; he might draw conclusions: was it not as\nwell, then, that he should see a letter which put that mystery to\nright? and above all since Guest, being a great student and critic of\nhandwriting, would consider the step natural and obliging? The clerk,\nbesides, was a man of counsel; he could scarce read so strange a\ndocument without dropping a remark; and by that remark Mr. Utterson\nmight shape his future course.\n\n\"This is a sad business about Sir Danvers,\" he said.\n\n\"Yes, sir, indeed. It has elicited a great deal of public feeling,\"\nreturned Guest. \"The man, of course, was mad.\"\n\n\"I should like to hear your views on that,\" replied Utterson. \"I have a\ndocument here in his handwriting; it is between ourselves, for I scarce\nknow what to do about it; it is an ugly business at the best. But there\nit is; quite in your way: a murderer's autograph.\"\n\nGuest's eyes brightened, and he sat down at once and studied it with\npassion. \"No sir,\" he said: \"not mad; but it is an odd hand.\"\n\n\"And by all accounts a very odd writer,\" added the lawyer.\n\nJust then the servant entered with a note.\n\n\"Is that from Dr. Jekyll, sir?\" inquired the clerk. \"I thought I knew\nthe writing. Anything private, Mr. Utterson?\"\n\n\"Only an invitation to dinner. Why? Do you want to see it?\"\n\n\"One moment. I thank you, sir;\" and the clerk laid the two sheets of\npaper alongside and sedulously compared their contents. \"Thank you,\nsir,\" he said at last, returning both; \"it's a very interesting\nautograph.\"\n\nThere was a pause, during which Mr. Utterson struggled with himself.\n\"Why did you compare them, Guest?\" he inquired suddenly.\n\n\"Well, sir,\" returned the clerk, \"there's a rather singular resemblance;\nthe two hands are in many points identical: only differently sloped.\"\n\n\"Rather quaint,\" said Utterson.\n\n\"It is, as you say, rather quaint,\" returned Guest.\n\n\"I wouldn't speak of this note, you know,\" said the master.\n\n\"No, sir,\" said the clerk. \"I understand.\"\n\nBut no sooner was Mr. Utterson alone that night, than he locked the\nnote into his safe, where it reposed from that time forward. \"What!\" he\nthought. \"Henry Jekyll forge for a murderer!\" And his blood ran cold in\nhis veins.\n\n\n\n\nINCIDENT OF DR. LANYON\n\n\nTime ran on; thousands of pounds were offered in reward, for the\ndeath of Sir Danvers was resented as a public injury; but Mr. Hyde had\ndisappeared out of the ken of the police as though he had never existed.\nMuch of his past was unearthed, indeed, and all disreputable: tales came\nout of the man's cruelty, at once so callous and violent; of his vile\nlife, of his strange associates, of the hatred that seemed to have\nsurrounded his career; but of his present whereabouts, not a whisper.\nFrom the time he had left the house in Soho on the morning of the\nmurder, he was simply blotted out; and gradually, as time drew on, Mr.\nUtterson began to recover from the hotness of his alarm, and to grow\nmore at quiet with himself. The death of Sir Danvers was, to his way of\nthinking, more than paid for by the disappearance of Mr. Hyde. Now that\nthat evil influence had been withdrawn, a new life began for Dr. Jekyll.\nHe came out of his seclusion, renewed relations with his friends, became\nonce more their familiar guest and entertainer; and whilst he had always\nbeen known for charities, he was now no less distinguished for religion.\nHe was busy, he was much in the open air, he did good; his face seemed\nto open and brighten, as if with an inward consciousness of service; and\nfor more than two months, the doctor was at peace.\n\nOn the 8th of January Utterson had dined at the doctor's with a small\nparty; Lanyon had been there; and the face of the host had looked from\none to the other as in the old days when the trio were inseparable\nfriends. On the 12th, and again on the 14th, the door was shut against\nthe lawyer. \"The doctor was confined to the house,\" Poole said, \"and saw\nno one.\" On the 15th, he tried again, and was again refused; and having\nnow been used for the last two months to see his friend almost daily, he\nfound this return of solitude to weigh upon his spirits. The fifth night\nhe had in Guest to dine with him; and the sixth he betook himself to Dr.\nLanyon's.\n\nThere at least he was not denied admittance; but when he came in, he was\nshocked at the change which had taken place in the doctor's appearance.\nHe had his death-warrant written legibly upon his face. The rosy man had\ngrown pale; his flesh had fallen away; he was visibly balder and older;\nand yet it was not so much these tokens of a swift physical decay that\narrested the lawyer's notice, as a look in the eye and quality of manner\nthat seemed to testify to some deep-seated terror of the mind. It\nwas unlikely that the doctor should fear death; and yet that was what\nUtterson was tempted to suspect. \"Yes,\" he thought; \"he is a doctor, he\nmust know his own state and that his days are counted; and the knowledge\nis more than he can bear.\" And yet when Utterson remarked on his\nill-looks, it was with an air of great firmness that Lanyon declared\nhimself a doomed man.\n\n\"I have had a shock,\" he said, \"and I shall never recover. It is a\nquestion of weeks. Well, life has been pleasant; I liked it; yes, sir,\nI used to like it. I sometimes think if we knew all, we should be more\nglad to get away.\"\n\n\"Jekyll is ill, too,\" observed Utterson. \"Have you seen him?\"\n\nBut Lanyon's face changed, and he held up a trembling hand. \"I wish to\nsee or hear no more of Dr. Jekyll,\" he said in a loud, unsteady voice.\n\"I am quite done with that person; and I beg that you will spare me any\nallusion to one whom I regard as dead.\"\n\n\"Tut-tut,\" said Mr. Utterson; and then after a considerable pause,\n\"Can't I do anything?\" he inquired. \"We are three very old friends,\nLanyon; we shall not live to make others.\"\n\n\"Nothing can be done,\" returned Lanyon; \"ask himself.\"\n\n\"He will not see me,\" said the lawyer.\n\n\"I am not surprised at that,\" was the reply. \"Some day, Utterson, after\nI am dead, you may perhaps come to learn the right and wrong of this. I\ncannot tell you. And in the meantime, if you can sit and talk with me\nof other things, for God's sake, stay and do so; but if you cannot keep\nclear of this accursed topic, then in God's name, go, for I cannot bear\nit.\"\n\nAs soon as he got home, Utterson sat down and wrote to Jekyll,\ncomplaining of his exclusion from the house, and asking the cause of\nthis unhappy break with Lanyon; and the next day brought him a long\nanswer, often very pathetically worded, and sometimes darkly mysterious\nin drift. The quarrel with Lanyon was incurable. \"I do not blame our old\nfriend,\" Jekyll wrote, \"but I share his view that we must never meet. I\nmean from henceforth to lead a life of extreme seclusion; you must not\nbe surprised, nor must you doubt my friendship, if my door is often shut\neven to you. You must suffer me to go my own dark way. I have brought on\nmyself a punishment and a danger that I cannot name. If I am the chief\nof sinners, I am the chief of sufferers also. I could not think that\nthis earth contained a place for sufferings and terrors so unmanning;\nand you can do but one thing, Utterson, to lighten this destiny, and\nthat is to respect my silence.\" Utterson was amazed; the dark influence\nof Hyde had been withdrawn, the doctor had returned to his old tasks\nand amities; a week ago, the prospect had smiled with every promise of a\ncheerful and an honoured age; and now in a moment, friendship, and peace\nof mind, and the whole tenor of his life were wrecked. So great and\nunprepared a change pointed to madness; but in view of Lanyon's manner\nand words, there must lie for it some deeper ground.\n\nA week afterwards Dr. Lanyon took to his bed, and in something less than\na fortnight he was dead. The night after the funeral, at which he had\nbeen sadly affected, Utterson locked the door of his business room,\nand sitting there by the light of a melancholy candle, drew out and set\nbefore him an envelope addressed by the hand and sealed with the seal of\nhis dead friend. \"PRIVATE: for the hands of G. J. Utterson ALONE, and in\ncase of his predecease to be destroyed unread,\" so it was emphatically\nsuperscribed; and the lawyer dreaded to behold the contents. \"I have\nburied one friend to-day,\" he thought: \"what if this should cost me\nanother?\" And then he condemned the fear as a disloyalty, and broke the\nseal. Within there was another enclosure, likewise sealed, and marked\nupon the cover as \"not to be opened till the death or disappearance\nof Dr. Henry Jekyll.\" Utterson could not trust his eyes. Yes, it was\ndisappearance; here again, as in the mad will which he had long ago\nrestored to its author, here again were the idea of a disappearance\nand the name of Henry Jekyll bracketted. But in the will, that idea had\nsprung from the sinister suggestion of the man Hyde; it was set there\nwith a purpose all too plain and horrible. Written by the hand of\nLanyon, what should it mean? A great curiosity came on the trustee,\nto disregard the prohibition and dive at once to the bottom of these\nmysteries; but professional honour and faith to his dead friend were\nstringent obligations; and the packet slept in the inmost corner of his\nprivate safe.\n\nIt is one thing to mortify curiosity, another to conquer it; and it may\nbe doubted if, from that day forth, Utterson desired the society of his\nsurviving friend with the same eagerness. He thought of him kindly; but\nhis thoughts were disquieted and fearful. He went to call indeed; but he\nwas perhaps relieved to be denied admittance; perhaps, in his heart, he\npreferred to speak with Poole upon the doorstep and surrounded by the\nair and sounds of the open city, rather than to be admitted into that\nhouse of voluntary bondage, and to sit and speak with its inscrutable\nrecluse. Poole had, indeed, no very pleasant news to communicate. The\ndoctor, it appeared, now more than ever confined himself to the cabinet\nover the laboratory, where he would sometimes even sleep; he was out of\nspirits, he had grown very silent, he did not read; it seemed as if\nhe had something on his mind. Utterson became so used to the unvarying\ncharacter of these reports, that he fell off little by little in the\nfrequency of his visits.\n\n\n\n\nINCIDENT AT THE WINDOW\n\n\nIt chanced on Sunday, when Mr. Utterson was on his usual walk with Mr.\nEnfield, that their way lay once again through the by-street; and that\nwhen they came in front of the door, both stopped to gaze on it.\n\n\"Well,\" said Enfield, \"that story's at an end at least. We shall never\nsee more of Mr. Hyde.\"\n\n\"I hope not,\" said Utterson. \"Did I ever tell you that I once saw him,\nand shared your feeling of repulsion?\"\n\n\"It was impossible to do the one without the other,\" returned Enfield.\n\"And by the way, what an ass you must have thought me, not to know that\nthis was a back way to Dr. Jekyll's! It was partly your own fault that I\nfound it out, even when I did.\"\n\n\"So you found it out, did you?\" said Utterson. \"But if that be so, we\nmay step into the court and take a look at the windows. To tell you the\ntruth, I am uneasy about poor Jekyll; and even outside, I feel as if the\npresence of a friend might do him good.\"\n\nThe court was very cool and a little damp, and full of premature\ntwilight, although the sky, high up overhead, was still bright with\nsunset. The middle one of the three windows was half-way open; and\nsitting close beside it, taking the air with an infinite sadness of\nmien, like some disconsolate prisoner, Utterson saw Dr. Jekyll.\n\n\"What! Jekyll!\" he cried. \"I trust you are better.\"\n\n\"I am very low, Utterson,\" replied the doctor drearily, \"very low. It\nwill not last long, thank God.\"\n\n\"You stay too much indoors,\" said the lawyer. \"You should be out,\nwhipping up the circulation like Mr. Enfield and me. (This is my\ncousin--Mr. Enfield--Dr. Jekyll.) Come now; get your hat and take a\nquick turn with us.\"\n\n\"You are very good,\" sighed the other. \"I should like to very much; but\nno, no, no, it is quite impossible; I dare not. But indeed, Utterson,\nI am very glad to see you; this is really a great pleasure; I would ask\nyou and Mr. Enfield up, but the place is really not fit.\"\n\n\"Why, then,\" said the lawyer, good-naturedly, \"the best thing we can do\nis to stay down here and speak with you from where we are.\"\n\n\"That is just what I was about to venture to propose,\" returned the\ndoctor with a smile. But the words were hardly uttered, before the smile\nwas struck out of his face and succeeded by an expression of such abject\nterror and despair, as froze the very blood of the two gentlemen below.\nThey saw it but for a glimpse for the window was instantly thrust down;\nbut that glimpse had been sufficient, and they turned and left the court\nwithout a word. In silence, too, they traversed the by-street; and it\nwas not until they had come into a neighbouring thoroughfare, where even\nupon a Sunday there were still some stirrings of life, that Mr. Utterson\nat last turned and looked at his companion. They were both pale; and\nthere was an answering horror in their eyes.\n\n\"God forgive us, God forgive us,\" said Mr. Utterson.\n\nBut Mr. Enfield only nodded his head very seriously, and walked on once\nmore in silence.\n\n\n\n\nTHE LAST NIGHT\n\n\nMr. Utterson was sitting by his fireside one evening after dinner, when\nhe was surprised to receive a visit from Poole.\n\n\"Bless me, Poole, what brings you here?\" he cried; and then taking a\nsecond look at him, \"What ails you?\" he added; \"is the doctor ill?\"\n\n\"Mr. Utterson,\" said the man, \"there is something wrong.\"\n\n\"Take a seat, and here is a glass of wine for you,\" said the lawyer.\n\"Now, take your time, and tell me plainly what you want.\"\n\n\"You know the doctor's ways, sir,\" replied Poole, \"and how he shuts\nhimself up. Well, he's shut up again in the cabinet; and I don't like\nit, sir--I wish I may die if I like it. Mr. Utterson, sir, I'm afraid.\"\n\n\"Now, my good man,\" said the lawyer, \"be explicit. What are you afraid\nof?\"\n\n\"I've been afraid for about a week,\" returned Poole, doggedly\ndisregarding the question, \"and I can bear it no more.\"\n\nThe man's appearance amply bore out his words; his manner was altered\nfor the worse; and except for the moment when he had first announced his\nterror, he had not once looked the lawyer in the face. Even now, he sat\nwith the glass of wine untasted on his knee, and his eyes directed to a\ncorner of the floor. \"I can bear it no more,\" he repeated.\n\n\"Come,\" said the lawyer, \"I see you have some good reason, Poole; I see\nthere is something seriously amiss. Try to tell me what it is.\"\n\n\"I think there's been foul play,\" said Poole, hoarsely.\n\n\"Foul play!\" cried the lawyer, a good deal frightened and rather\ninclined to be irritated in consequence. \"What foul play! What does the\nman mean?\"\n\n\"I daren't say, sir,\" was the answer; \"but will you come along with me\nand see for yourself?\"\n\nMr. Utterson's only answer was to rise and get his hat and greatcoat;\nbut he observed with wonder the greatness of the relief that appeared\nupon the butler's face, and perhaps with no less, that the wine was\nstill untasted when he set it down to follow.\n\nIt was a wild, cold, seasonable night of March, with a pale moon, lying\non her back as though the wind had tilted her, and flying wrack of the\nmost diaphanous and lawny texture. The wind made talking difficult, and\nflecked the blood into the face. It seemed to have swept the streets\nunusually bare of passengers, besides; for Mr. Utterson thought he had\nnever seen that part of London so deserted. He could have wished it\notherwise; never in his life had he been conscious of so sharp a wish to\nsee and touch his fellow-creatures; for struggle as he might, there was\nborne in upon his mind a crushing anticipation of calamity. The square,\nwhen they got there, was full of wind and dust, and the thin trees in\nthe garden were lashing themselves along the railing. Poole, who had\nkept all the way a pace or two ahead, now pulled up in the middle of\nthe pavement, and in spite of the biting weather, took off his hat and\nmopped his brow with a red pocket-handkerchief. But for all the hurry of\nhis coming, these were not the dews of exertion that he wiped away, but\nthe moisture of some strangling anguish; for his face was white and his\nvoice, when he spoke, harsh and broken.\n\n\"Well, sir,\" he said, \"here we are, and God grant there be nothing\nwrong.\"\n\n\"Amen, Poole,\" said the lawyer.\n\nThereupon the servant knocked in a very guarded manner; the door was\nopened on the chain; and a voice asked from within, \"Is that you,\nPoole?\"\n\n\"It's all right,\" said Poole. \"Open the door.\"\n\nThe hall, when they entered it, was brightly lighted up; the fire was\nbuilt high; and about the hearth the whole of the servants, men and\nwomen, stood huddled together like a flock of sheep. At the sight of Mr.\nUtterson, the housemaid broke into hysterical whimpering; and the cook,\ncrying out \"Bless God! it's Mr. Utterson,\" ran forward as if to take him\nin her arms.\n\n\"What, what? Are you all here?\" said the lawyer peevishly. \"Very\nirregular, very unseemly; your master would be far from pleased.\"\n\n\"They're all afraid,\" said Poole.\n\nBlank silence followed, no one protesting; only the maid lifted her\nvoice and now wept loudly.\n\n\"Hold your tongue!\" Poole said to her, with a ferocity of accent that\ntestified to his own jangled nerves; and indeed, when the girl had so\nsuddenly raised the note of her lamentation, they had all started and\nturned towards the inner door with faces of dreadful expectation.\n\"And now,\" continued the butler, addressing the knife-boy, \"reach me a\ncandle, and we'll get this through hands at once.\" And then he begged\nMr. Utterson to follow him, and led the way to the back garden.\n\n\"Now, sir,\" said he, \"you come as gently as you can. I want you to hear,\nand I don't want you to be heard. And see here, sir, if by any chance he\nwas to ask you in, don't go.\"\n\nMr. Utterson's nerves, at this unlooked-for termination, gave a jerk\nthat nearly threw him from his balance; but he recollected his courage\nand followed the butler into the laboratory building through the\nsurgical theatre, with its lumber of crates and bottles, to the foot\nof the stair. Here Poole motioned him to stand on one side and listen;\nwhile he himself, setting down the candle and making a great and obvious\ncall on his resolution, mounted the steps and knocked with a somewhat\nuncertain hand on the red baize of the cabinet door.\n\n\"Mr. Utterson, sir, asking to see you,\" he called; and even as he did\nso, once more violently signed to the lawyer to give ear.\n\nA voice answered from within: \"Tell him I cannot see anyone,\" it said\ncomplainingly.\n\n\"Thank you, sir,\" said Poole, with a note of something like triumph in\nhis voice; and taking up his candle, he led Mr. Utterson back across the\nyard and into the great kitchen, where the fire was out and the beetles\nwere leaping on the floor.\n\n\"Sir,\" he said, looking Mr. Utterson in the eyes, \"Was that my master's\nvoice?\"\n\n\"It seems much changed,\" replied the lawyer, very pale, but giving look\nfor look.\n\n\"Changed? Well, yes, I think so,\" said the butler. \"Have I been twenty\nyears in this man's house, to be deceived about his voice? No, sir;\nmaster's made away with; he was made away with eight days ago, when we\nheard him cry out upon the name of God; and who's in there instead\nof him, and why it stays there, is a thing that cries to Heaven, Mr.\nUtterson!\"\n\n\"This is a very strange tale, Poole; this is rather a wild tale my man,\"\nsaid Mr. Utterson, biting his finger. \"Suppose it were as you suppose,\nsupposing Dr. Jekyll to have been--well, murdered what could induce the\nmurderer to stay? That won't hold water; it doesn't commend itself to\nreason.\"\n\n\"Well, Mr. Utterson, you are a hard man to satisfy, but I'll do it yet,\"\nsaid Poole. \"All this last week (you must know) him, or it, whatever it\nis that lives in that cabinet, has been crying night and day for some\nsort of medicine and cannot get it to his mind. It was sometimes his\nway--the master's, that is--to write his orders on a sheet of paper and\nthrow it on the stair. We've had nothing else this week back; nothing\nbut papers, and a closed door, and the very meals left there to be\nsmuggled in when nobody was looking. Well, sir, every day, ay, and twice\nand thrice in the same day, there have been orders and complaints, and I\nhave been sent flying to all the wholesale chemists in town. Every time\nI brought the stuff back, there would be another paper telling me to\nreturn it, because it was not pure, and another order to a different\nfirm. This drug is wanted bitter bad, sir, whatever for.\"\n\n\"Have you any of these papers?\" asked Mr. Utterson.\n\nPoole felt in his pocket and handed out a crumpled note, which the\nlawyer, bending nearer to the candle, carefully examined. Its contents\nran thus: \"Dr. Jekyll presents his compliments to Messrs. Maw. He\nassures them that their last sample is impure and quite useless for his\npresent purpose. In the year 18--, Dr. J. purchased a somewhat large\nquantity from Messrs. M. He now begs them to search with most sedulous\ncare, and should any of the same quality be left, forward it to him at\nonce. Expense is no consideration. The importance of this to Dr. J. can\nhardly be exaggerated.\" So far the letter had run composedly enough, but\nhere with a sudden splutter of the pen, the writer's emotion had broken\nloose. \"For God's sake,\" he added, \"find me some of the old.\"\n\n\"This is a strange note,\" said Mr. Utterson; and then sharply, \"How do\nyou come to have it open?\"\n\n\"The man at Maw's was main angry, sir, and he threw it back to me like\nso much dirt,\" returned Poole.\n\n\"This is unquestionably the doctor's hand, do you know?\" resumed the\nlawyer.\n\n\"I thought it looked like it,\" said the servant rather sulkily; and\nthen, with another voice, \"But what matters hand of write?\" he said.\n\"I've seen him!\"\n\n\"Seen him?\" repeated Mr. Utterson. \"Well?\"\n\n\"That's it!\" said Poole. \"It was this way. I came suddenly into the\ntheatre from the garden. It seems he had slipped out to look for this\ndrug or whatever it is; for the cabinet door was open, and there he was\nat the far end of the room digging among the crates. He looked up when\nI came in, gave a kind of cry, and whipped upstairs into the cabinet. It\nwas but for one minute that I saw him, but the hair stood upon my head\nlike quills. Sir, if that was my master, why had he a mask upon his\nface? If it was my master, why did he cry out like a rat, and run from\nme? I have served him long enough. And then...\" The man paused and\npassed his hand over his face.\n\n\"These are all very strange circumstances,\" said Mr. Utterson, \"but I\nthink I begin to see daylight. Your master, Poole, is plainly seized\nwith one of those maladies that both torture and deform the sufferer;\nhence, for aught I know, the alteration of his voice; hence the mask and\nthe avoidance of his friends; hence his eagerness to find this drug, by\nmeans of which the poor soul retains some hope of ultimate recovery--God\ngrant that he be not deceived! There is my explanation; it is sad\nenough, Poole, ay, and appalling to consider; but it is plain and\nnatural, hangs well together, and delivers us from all exorbitant\nalarms.\"\n\n\"Sir,\" said the butler, turning to a sort of mottled pallor, \"that thing\nwas not my master, and there's the truth. My master\"--here he looked\nround him and began to whisper--\"is a tall, fine build of a man, and\nthis was more of a dwarf.\" Utterson attempted to protest. \"O, sir,\"\ncried Poole, \"do you think I do not know my master after twenty years?\nDo you think I do not know where his head comes to in the cabinet door,\nwhere I saw him every morning of my life? No, sir, that thing in the\nmask was never Dr. Jekyll--God knows what it was, but it was never Dr.\nJekyll; and it is the belief of my heart that there was murder done.\"\n\n\"Poole,\" replied the lawyer, \"if you say that, it will become my duty to\nmake certain. Much as I desire to spare your master's feelings, much as\nI am puzzled by this note which seems to prove him to be still alive, I\nshall consider it my duty to break in that door.\"\n\n\"Ah, Mr. Utterson, that's talking!\" cried the butler.\n\n\"And now comes the second question,\" resumed Utterson: \"Who is going to\ndo it?\"\n\n\"Why, you and me, sir,\" was the undaunted reply.\n\n\"That's very well said,\" returned the lawyer; \"and whatever comes of it,\nI shall make it my business to see you are no loser.\"\n\n\"There is an axe in the theatre,\" continued Poole; \"and you might take\nthe kitchen poker for yourself.\"\n\nThe lawyer took that rude but weighty instrument into his hand, and\nbalanced it. \"Do you know, Poole,\" he said, looking up, \"that you and I\nare about to place ourselves in a position of some peril?\"\n\n\"You may say so, sir, indeed,\" returned the butler.\n\n\"It is well, then that we should be frank,\" said the other. \"We both\nthink more than we have said; let us make a clean breast. This masked\nfigure that you saw, did you recognise it?\"\n\n\"Well, sir, it went so quick, and the creature was so doubled up, that\nI could hardly swear to that,\" was the answer. \"But if you mean, was it\nMr. Hyde?--why, yes, I think it was! You see, it was much of the same\nbigness; and it had the same quick, light way with it; and then who else\ncould have got in by the laboratory door? You have not forgot, sir, that\nat the time of the murder he had still the key with him? But that's not\nall. I don't know, Mr. Utterson, if you ever met this Mr. Hyde?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said the lawyer, \"I once spoke with him.\"\n\n\"Then you must know as well as the rest of us that there was something\nqueer about that gentleman--something that gave a man a turn--I don't\nknow rightly how to say it, sir, beyond this: that you felt in your\nmarrow kind of cold and thin.\"\n\n\"I own I felt something of what you describe,\" said Mr. Utterson.\n\n\"Quite so, sir,\" returned Poole. \"Well, when that masked thing like a\nmonkey jumped from among the chemicals and whipped into the cabinet, it\nwent down my spine like ice. O, I know it's not evidence, Mr. Utterson;\nI'm book-learned enough for that; but a man has his feelings, and I give\nyou my bible-word it was Mr. Hyde!\"\n\n\"Ay, ay,\" said the lawyer. \"My fears incline to the same point. Evil,\nI fear, founded--evil was sure to come--of that connection. Ay truly, I\nbelieve you; I believe poor Harry is killed; and I believe his murderer\n(for what purpose, God alone can tell) is still lurking in his victim's\nroom. Well, let our name be vengeance. Call Bradshaw.\"\n\nThe footman came at the summons, very white and nervous.\n\n\"Put yourself together, Bradshaw,\" said the lawyer. \"This suspense, I\nknow, is telling upon all of you; but it is now our intention to make\nan end of it. Poole, here, and I are going to force our way into the\ncabinet. If all is well, my shoulders are broad enough to bear\nthe blame. Meanwhile, lest anything should really be amiss, or any\nmalefactor seek to escape by the back, you and the boy must go round the\ncorner with a pair of good sticks and take your post at the laboratory\ndoor. We give you ten minutes, to get to your stations.\"\n\nAs Bradshaw left, the lawyer looked at his watch. \"And now, Poole, let\nus get to ours,\" he said; and taking the poker under his arm, led the\nway into the yard. The scud had banked over the moon, and it was now\nquite dark. The wind, which only broke in puffs and draughts into that\ndeep well of building, tossed the light of the candle to and fro about\ntheir steps, until they came into the shelter of the theatre, where they\nsat down silently to wait. London hummed solemnly all around; but nearer\nat hand, the stillness was only broken by the sounds of a footfall\nmoving to and fro along the cabinet floor.\n\n\"So it will walk all day, sir,\" whispered Poole; \"ay, and the better\npart of the night. Only when a new sample comes from the chemist,\nthere's a bit of a break. Ah, it's an ill conscience that's such an\nenemy to rest! Ah, sir, there's blood foully shed in every step of\nit! But hark again, a little closer--put your heart in your ears, Mr.\nUtterson, and tell me, is that the doctor's foot?\"\n\nThe steps fell lightly and oddly, with a certain swing, for all they\nwent so slowly; it was different indeed from the heavy creaking tread of\nHenry Jekyll. Utterson sighed. \"Is there never anything else?\" he asked.\n\nPoole nodded. \"Once,\" he said. \"Once I heard it weeping!\"\n\n\"Weeping? how that?\" said the lawyer, conscious of a sudden chill of\nhorror.\n\n\"Weeping like a woman or a lost soul,\" said the butler. \"I came away\nwith that upon my heart, that I could have wept too.\"\n\nBut now the ten minutes drew to an end. Poole disinterred the axe from\nunder a stack of packing straw; the candle was set upon the nearest\ntable to light them to the attack; and they drew near with bated breath\nto where that patient foot was still going up and down, up and down, in\nthe quiet of the night. \"Jekyll,\" cried Utterson, with a loud voice, \"I\ndemand to see you.\" He paused a moment, but there came no reply. \"I give\nyou fair warning, our suspicions are aroused, and I must and shall see\nyou,\" he resumed; \"if not by fair means, then by foul--if not of your\nconsent, then by brute force!\"\n\n\"Utterson,\" said the voice, \"for God's sake, have mercy!\"\n\n\"Ah, that's not Jekyll's voice--it's Hyde's!\" cried Utterson. \"Down with\nthe door, Poole!\"\n\nPoole swung the axe over his shoulder; the blow shook the building, and\nthe red baize door leaped against the lock and hinges. A dismal screech,\nas of mere animal terror, rang from the cabinet. Up went the axe again,\nand again the panels crashed and the frame bounded; four times the\nblow fell; but the wood was tough and the fittings were of excellent\nworkmanship; and it was not until the fifth, that the lock burst and the\nwreck of the door fell inwards on the carpet.\n\nThe besiegers, appalled by their own riot and the stillness that had\nsucceeded, stood back a little and peered in. There lay the cabinet\nbefore their eyes in the quiet lamplight, a good fire glowing and\nchattering on the hearth, the kettle singing its thin strain, a drawer\nor two open, papers neatly set forth on the business table, and nearer\nthe fire, the things laid out for tea; the quietest room, you would\nhave said, and, but for the glazed presses full of chemicals, the most\ncommonplace that night in London.\n\nRight in the middle there lay the body of a man sorely contorted and\nstill twitching. They drew near on tiptoe, turned it on its back and\nbeheld the face of Edward Hyde. He was dressed in clothes far too large\nfor him, clothes of the doctor's bigness; the cords of his face still\nmoved with a semblance of life, but life was quite gone: and by the\ncrushed phial in the hand and the strong smell of kernels that hung\nupon the air, Utterson knew that he was looking on the body of a\nself-destroyer.\n\n\"We have come too late,\" he said sternly, \"whether to save or punish.\nHyde is gone to his account; and it only remains for us to find the body\nof your master.\"\n\nThe far greater proportion of the building was occupied by the theatre,\nwhich filled almost the whole ground storey and was lighted from above,\nand by the cabinet, which formed an upper story at one end and looked\nupon the court. A corridor joined the theatre to the door on the\nby-street; and with this the cabinet communicated separately by a second\nflight of stairs. There were besides a few dark closets and a spacious\ncellar. All these they now thoroughly examined. Each closet needed but\na glance, for all were empty, and all, by the dust that fell from their\ndoors, had stood long unopened. The cellar, indeed, was filled with\ncrazy lumber, mostly dating from the times of the surgeon who was\nJekyll's predecessor; but even as they opened the door they were\nadvertised of the uselessness of further search, by the fall of a\nperfect mat of cobweb which had for years sealed up the entrance. No\nwhere was there any trace of Henry Jekyll dead or alive.\n\nPoole stamped on the flags of the corridor. \"He must be buried here,\" he\nsaid, hearkening to the sound.\n\n\"Or he may have fled,\" said Utterson, and he turned to examine the door\nin the by-street. It was locked; and lying near by on the flags, they\nfound the key, already stained with rust.\n\n\"This does not look like use,\" observed the lawyer.\n\n\"Use!\" echoed Poole. \"Do you not see, sir, it is broken? much as if a\nman had stamped on it.\"\n\n\"Ay,\" continued Utterson, \"and the fractures, too, are rusty.\" The two\nmen looked at each other with a scare. \"This is beyond me, Poole,\" said\nthe lawyer. \"Let us go back to the cabinet.\"\n\nThey mounted the stair in silence, and still with an occasional\nawestruck glance at the dead body, proceeded more thoroughly to examine\nthe contents of the cabinet. At one table, there were traces of chemical\nwork, various measured heaps of some white salt being laid on glass\nsaucers, as though for an experiment in which the unhappy man had been\nprevented.\n\n\"That is the same drug that I was always bringing him,\" said Poole; and\neven as he spoke, the kettle with a startling noise boiled over.\n\nThis brought them to the fireside, where the easy-chair was drawn cosily\nup, and the tea things stood ready to the sitter's elbow, the very sugar\nin the cup. There were several books on a shelf; one lay beside the tea\nthings open, and Utterson was amazed to find it a copy of a pious work,\nfor which Jekyll had several times expressed a great esteem, annotated,\nin his own hand with startling blasphemies.\n\nNext, in the course of their review of the chamber, the searchers came\nto the cheval-glass, into whose depths they looked with an involuntary\nhorror. But it was so turned as to show them nothing but the rosy glow\nplaying on the roof, the fire sparkling in a hundred repetitions\nalong the glazed front of the presses, and their own pale and fearful\ncountenances stooping to look in.\n\n\"This glass has seen some strange things, sir,\" whispered Poole.\n\n\"And surely none stranger than itself,\" echoed the lawyer in the same\ntones. \"For what did Jekyll\"--he caught himself up at the word with a\nstart, and then conquering the weakness--\"what could Jekyll want with\nit?\" he said.\n\n\"You may say that!\" said Poole.\n\nNext they turned to the business table. On the desk, among the neat\narray of papers, a large envelope was uppermost, and bore, in the\ndoctor's hand, the name of Mr. Utterson. The lawyer unsealed it, and\nseveral enclosures fell to the floor. The first was a will, drawn in the\nsame eccentric terms as the one which he had returned six months before,\nto serve as a testament in case of death and as a deed of gift in case\nof disappearance; but in place of the name of Edward Hyde, the lawyer,\nwith indescribable amazement read the name of Gabriel John Utterson. He\nlooked at Poole, and then back at the paper, and last of all at the dead\nmalefactor stretched upon the carpet.\n\n\"My head goes round,\" he said. \"He has been all these days in\npossession; he had no cause to like me; he must have raged to see\nhimself displaced; and he has not destroyed this document.\"\n\nHe caught up the next paper; it was a brief note in the doctor's hand\nand dated at the top. \"O Poole!\" the lawyer cried, \"he was alive and\nhere this day. He cannot have been disposed of in so short a space; he\nmust be still alive, he must have fled! And then, why fled? and how?\nand in that case, can we venture to declare this suicide? O, we must\nbe careful. I foresee that we may yet involve your master in some dire\ncatastrophe.\"\n\n\"Why don't you read it, sir?\" asked Poole.\n\n\"Because I fear,\" replied the lawyer solemnly. \"God grant I have no\ncause for it!\" And with that he brought the paper to his eyes and read\nas follows:\n\n\"My dear Utterson,--When this shall fall into your hands, I shall have\ndisappeared, under what circumstances I have not the penetration to\nforesee, but my instinct and all the circumstances of my nameless\nsituation tell me that the end is sure and must be early. Go then, and\nfirst read the narrative which Lanyon warned me he was to place in your\nhands; and if you care to hear more, turn to the confession of\n\n\"Your unworthy and unhappy friend,\n\n\"HENRY JEKYLL.\"\n\n\"There was a third enclosure?\" asked Utterson.\n\n\"Here, sir,\" said Poole, and gave into his hands a considerable packet\nsealed in several places.\n\nThe lawyer put it in his pocket. \"I would say nothing of this paper. If\nyour master has fled or is dead, we may at least save his credit. It is\nnow ten; I must go home and read these documents in quiet; but I shall\nbe back before midnight, when we shall send for the police.\"\n\nThey went out, locking the door of the theatre behind them; and\nUtterson, once more leaving the servants gathered about the fire in the\nhall, trudged back to his office to read the two narratives in which\nthis mystery was now to be explained.\n\n\n\n\nDR. LANYON'S NARRATIVE\n\n\nOn the ninth of January, now four days ago, I received by the evening\ndelivery a registered envelope, addressed in the hand of my colleague\nand old school companion, Henry Jekyll. I was a good deal surprised by\nthis; for we were by no means in the habit of correspondence; I had seen\nthe man, dined with him, indeed, the night before; and I could\nimagine nothing in our intercourse that should justify formality of\nregistration. The contents increased my wonder; for this is how the\nletter ran:\n\n\"10th December, 18--.\n\n\"Dear Lanyon,--You are one of my oldest friends; and although we may\nhave differed at times on scientific questions, I cannot remember, at\nleast on my side, any break in our affection. There was never a day\nwhen, if you had said to me, `Jekyll, my life, my honour, my reason,\ndepend upon you,' I would not have sacrificed my left hand to help you.\nLanyon my life, my honour, my reason, are all at your mercy; if you fail\nme to-night, I am lost. You might suppose, after this preface, that I\nam going to ask you for something dishonourable to grant. Judge for\nyourself.\n\n\"I want you to postpone all other engagements for to-night--ay, even if\nyou were summoned to the bedside of an emperor; to take a cab, unless\nyour carriage should be actually at the door; and with this letter in\nyour hand for consultation, to drive straight to my house. Poole, my\nbutler, has his orders; you will find him waiting your arrival with a\nlocksmith. The door of my cabinet is then to be forced: and you are\nto go in alone; to open the glazed press (letter E) on the left hand,\nbreaking the lock if it be shut; and to draw out, with all its contents\nas they stand, the fourth drawer from the top or (which is the same\nthing) the third from the bottom. In my extreme distress of mind, I have\na morbid fear of misdirecting you; but even if I am in error, you may\nknow the right drawer by its contents: some powders, a phial and a\npaper book. This drawer I beg of you to carry back with you to Cavendish\nSquare exactly as it stands.\n\n\"That is the first part of the service: now for the second. You should\nbe back, if you set out at once on the receipt of this, long before\nmidnight; but I will leave you that amount of margin, not only in\nthe fear of one of those obstacles that can neither be prevented nor\nforeseen, but because an hour when your servants are in bed is to be\npreferred for what will then remain to do. At midnight, then, I have to\nask you to be alone in your consulting room, to admit with your own hand\ninto the house a man who will present himself in my name, and to place\nin his hands the drawer that you will have brought with you from my\ncabinet. Then you will have played your part and earned my gratitude\ncompletely. Five minutes afterwards, if you insist upon an explanation,\nyou will have understood that these arrangements are of capital\nimportance; and that by the neglect of one of them, fantastic as they\nmust appear, you might have charged your conscience with my death or the\nshipwreck of my reason.\n\n\"Confident as I am that you will not trifle with this appeal, my heart\nsinks and my hand trembles at the bare thought of such a possibility.\nThink of me at this hour, in a strange place, labouring under a\nblackness of distress that no fancy can exaggerate, and yet well aware\nthat, if you will but punctually serve me, my troubles will roll away\nlike a story that is told. Serve me, my dear Lanyon and save\n\n\"Your friend,\n\n\"H.J.\n\n\"P.S.--I had already sealed this up when a fresh terror struck upon my\nsoul. It is possible that the post-office may fail me, and this letter\nnot come into your hands until to-morrow morning. In that case, dear\nLanyon, do my errand when it shall be most convenient for you in the\ncourse of the day; and once more expect my messenger at midnight. It may\nthen already be too late; and if that night passes without event, you\nwill know that you have seen the last of Henry Jekyll.\"\n\nUpon the reading of this letter, I made sure my colleague was insane;\nbut till that was proved beyond the possibility of doubt, I felt bound\nto do as he requested. The less I understood of this farrago, the less\nI was in a position to judge of its importance; and an appeal so\nworded could not be set aside without a grave responsibility. I rose\naccordingly from table, got into a hansom, and drove straight to\nJekyll's house. The butler was awaiting my arrival; he had received by\nthe same post as mine a registered letter of instruction, and had sent\nat once for a locksmith and a carpenter. The tradesmen came while we\nwere yet speaking; and we moved in a body to old Dr. Denman's surgical\ntheatre, from which (as you are doubtless aware) Jekyll's private\ncabinet is most conveniently entered. The door was very strong, the lock\nexcellent; the carpenter avowed he would have great trouble and have\nto do much damage, if force were to be used; and the locksmith was near\ndespair. But this last was a handy fellow, and after two hour's work,\nthe door stood open. The press marked E was unlocked; and I took out the\ndrawer, had it filled up with straw and tied in a sheet, and returned\nwith it to Cavendish Square.\n\nHere I proceeded to examine its contents. The powders were neatly enough\nmade up, but not with the nicety of the dispensing chemist; so that it\nwas plain they were of Jekyll's private manufacture: and when I opened\none of the wrappers I found what seemed to me a simple crystalline salt\nof a white colour. The phial, to which I next turned my attention,\nmight have been about half full of a blood-red liquor, which was highly\npungent to the sense of smell and seemed to me to contain phosphorus and\nsome volatile ether. At the other ingredients I could make no guess. The\nbook was an ordinary version book and contained little but a series of\ndates. These covered a period of many years, but I observed that the\nentries ceased nearly a year ago and quite abruptly. Here and there a\nbrief remark was appended to a date, usually no more than a single\nword: \"double\" occurring perhaps six times in a total of several hundred\nentries; and once very early in the list and followed by several marks\nof exclamation, \"total failure!!!\" All this, though it whetted my\ncuriosity, told me little that was definite. Here were a phial of some\nsalt, and the record of a series of experiments that had led (like too\nmany of Jekyll's investigations) to no end of practical usefulness.\nHow could the presence of these articles in my house affect either\nthe honour, the sanity, or the life of my flighty colleague? If his\nmessenger could go to one place, why could he not go to another? And\neven granting some impediment, why was this gentleman to be received by\nme in secret? The more I reflected the more convinced I grew that I\nwas dealing with a case of cerebral disease; and though I dismissed my\nservants to bed, I loaded an old revolver, that I might be found in some\nposture of self-defence.\n\nTwelve o'clock had scarce rung out over London, ere the knocker sounded\nvery gently on the door. I went myself at the summons, and found a small\nman crouching against the pillars of the portico.\n\n\"Are you come from Dr. Jekyll?\" I asked.\n\nHe told me \"yes\" by a constrained gesture; and when I had bidden him\nenter, he did not obey me without a searching backward glance into the\ndarkness of the square. There was a policeman not far off, advancing\nwith his bull's eye open; and at the sight, I thought my visitor started\nand made greater haste.\n\nThese particulars struck me, I confess, disagreeably; and as I followed\nhim into the bright light of the consulting room, I kept my hand ready\non my weapon. Here, at last, I had a chance of clearly seeing him. I had\nnever set eyes on him before, so much was certain. He was small, as\nI have said; I was struck besides with the shocking expression of his\nface, with his remarkable combination of great muscular activity and\ngreat apparent debility of constitution, and--last but not least--with\nthe odd, subjective disturbance caused by his neighbourhood. This bore\nsome resemblance to incipient rigour, and was accompanied by a marked\nsinking of the pulse. At the time, I set it down to some idiosyncratic,\npersonal distaste, and merely wondered at the acuteness of the symptoms;\nbut I have since had reason to believe the cause to lie much deeper in\nthe nature of man, and to turn on some nobler hinge than the principle\nof hatred.\n\nThis person (who had thus, from the first moment of his entrance, struck\nin me what I can only describe as a disgustful curiosity) was dressed\nin a fashion that would have made an ordinary person laughable; his\nclothes, that is to say, although they were of rich and sober fabric,\nwere enormously too large for him in every measurement--the trousers\nhanging on his legs and rolled up to keep them from the ground, the\nwaist of the coat below his haunches, and the collar sprawling wide upon\nhis shoulders. Strange to relate, this ludicrous accoutrement was far\nfrom moving me to laughter. Rather, as there was something abnormal\nand misbegotten in the very essence of the creature that now faced\nme--something seizing, surprising and revolting--this fresh disparity\nseemed but to fit in with and to reinforce it; so that to my interest\nin the man's nature and character, there was added a curiosity as to his\norigin, his life, his fortune and status in the world.\n\nThese observations, though they have taken so great a space to be set\ndown in, were yet the work of a few seconds. My visitor was, indeed, on\nfire with sombre excitement.\n\n\"Have you got it?\" he cried. \"Have you got it?\" And so lively was his\nimpatience that he even laid his hand upon my arm and sought to shake\nme.\n\nI put him back, conscious at his touch of a certain icy pang along my\nblood. \"Come, sir,\" said I. \"You forget that I have not yet the pleasure\nof your acquaintance. Be seated, if you please.\" And I showed him an\nexample, and sat down myself in my customary seat and with as fair an\nimitation of my ordinary manner to a patient, as the lateness of the\nhour, the nature of my preoccupations, and the horror I had of my\nvisitor, would suffer me to muster.\n\n\"I beg your pardon, Dr. Lanyon,\" he replied civilly enough. \"What you\nsay is very well founded; and my impatience has shown its heels to my\npoliteness. I come here at the instance of your colleague, Dr. Henry\nJekyll, on a piece of business of some moment; and I understood...\" He\npaused and put his hand to his throat, and I could see, in spite of his\ncollected manner, that he was wrestling against the approaches of the\nhysteria--\"I understood, a drawer...\"\n\nBut here I took pity on my visitor's suspense, and some perhaps on my\nown growing curiosity.\n\n\"There it is, sir,\" said I, pointing to the drawer, where it lay on the\nfloor behind a table and still covered with the sheet.\n\nHe sprang to it, and then paused, and laid his hand upon his heart: I\ncould hear his teeth grate with the convulsive action of his jaws; and\nhis face was so ghastly to see that I grew alarmed both for his life and\nreason.\n\n\"Compose yourself,\" said I.\n\nHe turned a dreadful smile to me, and as if with the decision of\ndespair, plucked away the sheet. At sight of the contents, he uttered\none loud sob of such immense relief that I sat petrified. And the next\nmoment, in a voice that was already fairly well under control, \"Have you\na graduated glass?\" he asked.\n\nI rose from my place with something of an effort and gave him what he\nasked.\n\nHe thanked me with a smiling nod, measured out a few minims of the red\ntincture and added one of the powders. The mixture, which was at first\nof a reddish hue, began, in proportion as the crystals melted, to\nbrighten in colour, to effervesce audibly, and to throw off small fumes\nof vapour. Suddenly and at the same moment, the ebullition ceased and\nthe compound changed to a dark purple, which faded again more slowly to\na watery green. My visitor, who had watched these metamorphoses with a\nkeen eye, smiled, set down the glass upon the table, and then turned and\nlooked upon me with an air of scrutiny.\n\n\"And now,\" said he, \"to settle what remains. Will you be wise? will you\nbe guided? will you suffer me to take this glass in my hand and to\ngo forth from your house without further parley? or has the greed of\ncuriosity too much command of you? Think before you answer, for it shall\nbe done as you decide. As you decide, you shall be left as you were\nbefore, and neither richer nor wiser, unless the sense of service\nrendered to a man in mortal distress may be counted as a kind of riches\nof the soul. Or, if you shall so prefer to choose, a new province of\nknowledge and new avenues to fame and power shall be laid open to you,\nhere, in this room, upon the instant; and your sight shall be blasted by\na prodigy to stagger the unbelief of Satan.\"\n\n\"Sir,\" said I, affecting a coolness that I was far from truly\npossessing, \"you speak enigmas, and you will perhaps not wonder that I\nhear you with no very strong impression of belief. But I have gone too\nfar in the way of inexplicable services to pause before I see the end.\"\n\n\"It is well,\" replied my visitor. \"Lanyon, you remember your vows: what\nfollows is under the seal of our profession. And now, you who have so\nlong been bound to the most narrow and material views, you who have\ndenied the virtue of transcendental medicine, you who have derided your\nsuperiors--behold!\"\n\nHe put the glass to his lips and drank at one gulp. A cry followed;\nhe reeled, staggered, clutched at the table and held on, staring with\ninjected eyes, gasping with open mouth; and as I looked there came, I\nthought, a change--he seemed to swell--his face became suddenly black\nand the features seemed to melt and alter--and the next moment, I had\nsprung to my feet and leaped back against the wall, my arms raised to\nshield me from that prodigy, my mind submerged in terror.\n\n\"O God!\" I screamed, and \"O God!\" again and again; for there before my\neyes--pale and shaken, and half fainting, and groping before him with\nhis hands, like a man restored from death--there stood Henry Jekyll!\n\nWhat he told me in the next hour, I cannot bring my mind to set on\npaper. I saw what I saw, I heard what I heard, and my soul sickened at\nit; and yet now when that sight has faded from my eyes, I ask myself if\nI believe it, and I cannot answer. My life is shaken to its roots; sleep\nhas left me; the deadliest terror sits by me at all hours of the day and\nnight; and I feel that my days are numbered, and that I must die;\nand yet I shall die incredulous. As for the moral turpitude that man\nunveiled to me, even with tears of penitence, I can not, even in\nmemory, dwell on it without a start of horror. I will say but one thing,\nUtterson, and that (if you can bring your mind to credit it) will be\nmore than enough. The creature who crept into my house that night was,\non Jekyll's own confession, known by the name of Hyde and hunted for in\nevery corner of the land as the murderer of Carew.\n\nHASTIE LANYON\n\n\n\n\nHENRY JEKYLL'S FULL STATEMENT OF THE CASE\n\n\nI was born in the year 18-- to a large fortune, endowed besides with\nexcellent parts, inclined by nature to industry, fond of the respect\nof the wise and good among my fellowmen, and thus, as might have been\nsupposed, with every guarantee of an honourable and distinguished\nfuture. And indeed the worst of my faults was a certain impatient gaiety\nof disposition, such as has made the happiness of many, but such as I\nfound it hard to reconcile with my imperious desire to carry my head\nhigh, and wear a more than commonly grave countenance before the public.\nHence it came about that I concealed my pleasures; and that when I\nreached years of reflection, and began to look round me and take stock\nof my progress and position in the world, I stood already committed to\na profound duplicity of me. Many a man would have even blazoned such\nirregularities as I was guilty of; but from the high views that I had\nset before me, I regarded and hid them with an almost morbid sense of\nshame. It was thus rather the exacting nature of my aspirations than any\nparticular degradation in my faults, that made me what I was, and, with\neven a deeper trench than in the majority of men, severed in me those\nprovinces of good and ill which divide and compound man's dual nature.\nIn this case, I was driven to reflect deeply and inveterately on that\nhard law of life, which lies at the root of religion and is one of the\nmost plentiful springs of distress. Though so profound a double-dealer,\nI was in no sense a hypocrite; both sides of me were in dead earnest;\nI was no more myself when I laid aside restraint and plunged in shame,\nthan when I laboured, in the eye of day, at the furtherance of knowledge\nor the relief of sorrow and suffering. And it chanced that the direction\nof my scientific studies, which led wholly towards the mystic and the\ntranscendental, reacted and shed a strong light on this consciousness of\nthe perennial war among my members. With every day, and from both sides\nof my intelligence, the moral and the intellectual, I thus drew steadily\nnearer to that truth, by whose partial discovery I have been doomed to\nsuch a dreadful shipwreck: that man is not truly one, but truly two. I\nsay two, because the state of my own knowledge does not pass beyond that\npoint. Others will follow, others will outstrip me on the same lines;\nand I hazard the guess that man will be ultimately known for a mere\npolity of multifarious, incongruous and independent denizens. I, for my\npart, from the nature of my life, advanced infallibly in one direction\nand in one direction only. It was on the moral side, and in my own\nperson, that I learned to recognise the thorough and primitive duality\nof man; I saw that, of the two natures that contended in the field of my\nconsciousness, even if I could rightly be said to be either, it was only\nbecause I was radically both; and from an early date, even before the\ncourse of my scientific discoveries had begun to suggest the most naked\npossibility of such a miracle, I had learned to dwell with pleasure, as\na beloved daydream, on the thought of the separation of these elements.\nIf each, I told myself, could be housed in separate identities, life\nwould be relieved of all that was unbearable; the unjust might go his\nway, delivered from the aspirations and remorse of his more upright\ntwin; and the just could walk steadfastly and securely on his upward\npath, doing the good things in which he found his pleasure, and no\nlonger exposed to disgrace and penitence by the hands of this extraneous\nevil. It was the curse of mankind that these incongruous faggots were\nthus bound together--that in the agonised womb of consciousness, these\npolar twins should be continuously struggling. How, then were they\ndissociated?\n\nI was so far in my reflections when, as I have said, a side light began\nto shine upon the subject from the laboratory table. I began to\nperceive more deeply than it has ever yet been stated, the trembling\nimmateriality, the mistlike transience, of this seemingly so solid body\nin which we walk attired. Certain agents I found to have the power to\nshake and pluck back that fleshly vestment, even as a wind might toss\nthe curtains of a pavilion. For two good reasons, I will not enter\ndeeply into this scientific branch of my confession. First, because I\nhave been made to learn that the doom and burthen of our life is bound\nfor ever on man's shoulders, and when the attempt is made to cast\nit off, it but returns upon us with more unfamiliar and more awful\npressure. Second, because, as my narrative will make, alas! too evident,\nmy discoveries were incomplete. Enough then, that I not only recognised\nmy natural body from the mere aura and effulgence of certain of the\npowers that made up my spirit, but managed to compound a drug by which\nthese powers should be dethroned from their supremacy, and a second form\nand countenance substituted, none the less natural to me because they\nwere the expression, and bore the stamp of lower elements in my soul.\n\nI hesitated long before I put this theory to the test of practice. I\nknew well that I risked death; for any drug that so potently controlled\nand shook the very fortress of identity, might, by the least scruple of\nan overdose or at the least inopportunity in the moment of exhibition,\nutterly blot out that immaterial tabernacle which I looked to it to\nchange. But the temptation of a discovery so singular and profound at\nlast overcame the suggestions of alarm. I had long since prepared my\ntincture; I purchased at once, from a firm of wholesale chemists, a\nlarge quantity of a particular salt which I knew, from my experiments,\nto be the last ingredient required; and late one accursed night, I\ncompounded the elements, watched them boil and smoke together in the\nglass, and when the ebullition had subsided, with a strong glow of\ncourage, drank off the potion.\n\nThe most racking pangs succeeded: a grinding in the bones, deadly\nnausea, and a horror of the spirit that cannot be exceeded at the hour\nof birth or death. Then these agonies began swiftly to subside, and\nI came to myself as if out of a great sickness. There was something\nstrange in my sensations, something indescribably new and, from its very\nnovelty, incredibly sweet. I felt younger, lighter, happier in body;\nwithin I was conscious of a heady recklessness, a current of disordered\nsensual images running like a millrace in my fancy, a solution of the\nbonds of obligation, an unknown but not an innocent freedom of the soul.\nI knew myself, at the first breath of this new life, to be more wicked,\ntenfold more wicked, sold a slave to my original evil; and the thought,\nin that moment, braced and delighted me like wine. I stretched out my\nhands, exulting in the freshness of these sensations; and in the act, I\nwas suddenly aware that I had lost in stature.\n\nThere was no mirror, at that date, in my room; that which stands beside\nme as I write, was brought there later on and for the very purpose\nof these transformations. The night however, was far gone into\nthe morning--the morning, black as it was, was nearly ripe for the\nconception of the day--the inmates of my house were locked in the most\nrigorous hours of slumber; and I determined, flushed as I was with\nhope and triumph, to venture in my new shape as far as to my bedroom.\nI crossed the yard, wherein the constellations looked down upon me, I\ncould have thought, with wonder, the first creature of that sort that\ntheir unsleeping vigilance had yet disclosed to them; I stole through\nthe corridors, a stranger in my own house; and coming to my room, I saw\nfor the first time the appearance of Edward Hyde.\n\nI must here speak by theory alone, saying not that which I know, but\nthat which I suppose to be most probable. The evil side of my nature, to\nwhich I had now transferred the stamping efficacy, was less robust and\nless developed than the good which I had just deposed. Again, in the\ncourse of my life, which had been, after all, nine tenths a life of\neffort, virtue and control, it had been much less exercised and much\nless exhausted. And hence, as I think, it came about that Edward Hyde\nwas so much smaller, slighter and younger than Henry Jekyll. Even as\ngood shone upon the countenance of the one, evil was written broadly\nand plainly on the face of the other. Evil besides (which I must still\nbelieve to be the lethal side of man) had left on that body an imprint\nof deformity and decay. And yet when I looked upon that ugly idol in the\nglass, I was conscious of no repugnance, rather of a leap of welcome.\nThis, too, was myself. It seemed natural and human. In my eyes it bore\na livelier image of the spirit, it seemed more express and single, than\nthe imperfect and divided countenance I had been hitherto accustomed\nto call mine. And in so far I was doubtless right. I have observed that\nwhen I wore the semblance of Edward Hyde, none could come near to me at\nfirst without a visible misgiving of the flesh. This, as I take it, was\nbecause all human beings, as we meet them, are commingled out of good\nand evil: and Edward Hyde, alone in the ranks of mankind, was pure evil.\n\nI lingered but a moment at the mirror: the second and conclusive\nexperiment had yet to be attempted; it yet remained to be seen if I had\nlost my identity beyond redemption and must flee before daylight from a\nhouse that was no longer mine; and hurrying back to my cabinet, I\nonce more prepared and drank the cup, once more suffered the pangs\nof dissolution, and came to myself once more with the character, the\nstature and the face of Henry Jekyll.\n\nThat night I had come to the fatal cross-roads. Had I approached my\ndiscovery in a more noble spirit, had I risked the experiment while\nunder the empire of generous or pious aspirations, all must have been\notherwise, and from these agonies of death and birth, I had come forth\nan angel instead of a fiend. The drug had no discriminating action;\nit was neither diabolical nor divine; it but shook the doors of the\nprisonhouse of my disposition; and like the captives of Philippi, that\nwhich stood within ran forth. At that time my virtue slumbered; my evil,\nkept awake by ambition, was alert and swift to seize the occasion; and\nthe thing that was projected was Edward Hyde. Hence, although I had now\ntwo characters as well as two appearances, one was wholly evil, and the\nother was still the old Henry Jekyll, that incongruous compound of\nwhose reformation and improvement I had already learned to despair. The\nmovement was thus wholly toward the worse.\n\nEven at that time, I had not conquered my aversions to the dryness of\na life of study. I would still be merrily disposed at times; and as my\npleasures were (to say the least) undignified, and I was not only well\nknown and highly considered, but growing towards the elderly man, this\nincoherency of my life was daily growing more unwelcome. It was on this\nside that my new power tempted me until I fell in slavery. I had but to\ndrink the cup, to doff at once the body of the noted professor, and to\nassume, like a thick cloak, that of Edward Hyde. I smiled at the notion;\nit seemed to me at the time to be humourous; and I made my preparations\nwith the most studious care. I took and furnished that house in Soho,\nto which Hyde was tracked by the police; and engaged as a housekeeper\na creature whom I knew well to be silent and unscrupulous. On the other\nside, I announced to my servants that a Mr. Hyde (whom I described)\nwas to have full liberty and power about my house in the square; and to\nparry mishaps, I even called and made myself a familiar object, in\nmy second character. I next drew up that will to which you so much\nobjected; so that if anything befell me in the person of Dr. Jekyll,\nI could enter on that of Edward Hyde without pecuniary loss. And thus\nfortified, as I supposed, on every side, I began to profit by the\nstrange immunities of my position.\n\nMen have before hired bravos to transact their crimes, while their own\nperson and reputation sat under shelter. I was the first that ever did\nso for his pleasures. I was the first that could plod in the public eye\nwith a load of genial respectability, and in a moment, like a schoolboy,\nstrip off these lendings and spring headlong into the sea of liberty.\nBut for me, in my impenetrable mantle, the safety was complete. Think\nof it--I did not even exist! Let me but escape into my laboratory door,\ngive me but a second or two to mix and swallow the draught that I had\nalways standing ready; and whatever he had done, Edward Hyde would pass\naway like the stain of breath upon a mirror; and there in his stead,\nquietly at home, trimming the midnight lamp in his study, a man who\ncould afford to laugh at suspicion, would be Henry Jekyll.\n\nThe pleasures which I made haste to seek in my disguise were, as I have\nsaid, undignified; I would scarce use a harder term. But in the hands of\nEdward Hyde, they soon began to turn toward the monstrous. When I would\ncome back from these excursions, I was often plunged into a kind of\nwonder at my vicarious depravity. This familiar that I called out of\nmy own soul, and sent forth alone to do his good pleasure, was a being\ninherently malign and villainous; his every act and thought centered on\nself; drinking pleasure with bestial avidity from any degree of torture\nto another; relentless like a man of stone. Henry Jekyll stood at times\naghast before the acts of Edward Hyde; but the situation was apart from\nordinary laws, and insidiously relaxed the grasp of conscience. It was\nHyde, after all, and Hyde alone, that was guilty. Jekyll was no worse;\nhe woke again to his good qualities seemingly unimpaired; he would even\nmake haste, where it was possible, to undo the evil done by Hyde. And\nthus his conscience slumbered.\n\nInto the details of the infamy at which I thus connived (for even now\nI can scarce grant that I committed it) I have no design of entering; I\nmean but to point out the warnings and the successive steps with which\nmy chastisement approached. I met with one accident which, as it brought\non no consequence, I shall no more than mention. An act of cruelty to a\nchild aroused against me the anger of a passer-by, whom I recognised\nthe other day in the person of your kinsman; the doctor and the child's\nfamily joined him; there were moments when I feared for my life; and at\nlast, in order to pacify their too just resentment, Edward Hyde had to\nbring them to the door, and pay them in a cheque drawn in the name of\nHenry Jekyll. But this danger was easily eliminated from the future, by\nopening an account at another bank in the name of Edward Hyde himself;\nand when, by sloping my own hand backward, I had supplied my double with\na signature, I thought I sat beyond the reach of fate.\n\nSome two months before the murder of Sir Danvers, I had been out for one\nof my adventures, had returned at a late hour, and woke the next day in\nbed with somewhat odd sensations. It was in vain I looked about me; in\nvain I saw the decent furniture and tall proportions of my room in the\nsquare; in vain that I recognised the pattern of the bed curtains and\nthe design of the mahogany frame; something still kept insisting that I\nwas not where I was, that I had not wakened where I seemed to be, but in\nthe little room in Soho where I was accustomed to sleep in the body\nof Edward Hyde. I smiled to myself, and in my psychological way, began\nlazily to inquire into the elements of this illusion, occasionally, even\nas I did so, dropping back into a comfortable morning doze. I was still\nso engaged when, in one of my more wakeful moments, my eyes fell upon\nmy hand. Now the hand of Henry Jekyll (as you have often remarked) was\nprofessional in shape and size: it was large, firm, white and comely.\nBut the hand which I now saw, clearly enough, in the yellow light of a\nmid-London morning, lying half shut on the bedclothes, was lean, corder,\nknuckly, of a dusky pallor and thickly shaded with a swart growth of\nhair. It was the hand of Edward Hyde.\n\nI must have stared upon it for near half a minute, sunk as I was in the\nmere stupidity of wonder, before terror woke up in my breast as sudden\nand startling as the crash of cymbals; and bounding from my bed I rushed\nto the mirror. At the sight that met my eyes, my blood was changed into\nsomething exquisitely thin and icy. Yes, I had gone to bed Henry Jekyll,\nI had awakened Edward Hyde. How was this to be explained? I asked\nmyself; and then, with another bound of terror--how was it to be\nremedied? It was well on in the morning; the servants were up; all my\ndrugs were in the cabinet--a long journey down two pairs of stairs,\nthrough the back passage, across the open court and through the\nanatomical theatre, from where I was then standing horror-struck. It\nmight indeed be possible to cover my face; but of what use was that,\nwhen I was unable to conceal the alteration in my stature? And then with\nan overpowering sweetness of relief, it came back upon my mind that the\nservants were already used to the coming and going of my second self. I\nhad soon dressed, as well as I was able, in clothes of my own size: had\nsoon passed through the house, where Bradshaw stared and drew back at\nseeing Mr. Hyde at such an hour and in such a strange array; and ten\nminutes later, Dr. Jekyll had returned to his own shape and was sitting\ndown, with a darkened brow, to make a feint of breakfasting.\n\nSmall indeed was my appetite. This inexplicable incident, this reversal\nof my previous experience, seemed, like the Babylonian finger on the\nwall, to be spelling out the letters of my judgment; and I began to\nreflect more seriously than ever before on the issues and possibilities\nof my double existence. That part of me which I had the power of\nprojecting, had lately been much exercised and nourished; it had seemed\nto me of late as though the body of Edward Hyde had grown in stature, as\nthough (when I wore that form) I were conscious of a more generous tide\nof blood; and I began to spy a danger that, if this were much prolonged,\nthe balance of my nature might be permanently overthrown, the power of\nvoluntary change be forfeited, and the character of Edward Hyde become\nirrevocably mine. The power of the drug had not been always equally\ndisplayed. Once, very early in my career, it had totally failed me;\nsince then I had been obliged on more than one occasion to double, and\nonce, with infinite risk of death, to treble the amount; and these rare\nuncertainties had cast hitherto the sole shadow on my contentment.\nNow, however, and in the light of that morning's accident, I was led to\nremark that whereas, in the beginning, the difficulty had been to\nthrow off the body of Jekyll, it had of late gradually but decidedly\ntransferred itself to the other side. All things therefore seemed to\npoint to this; that I was slowly losing hold of my original and better\nself, and becoming slowly incorporated with my second and worse.\n\nBetween these two, I now felt I had to choose. My two natures had memory\nin common, but all other faculties were most unequally shared\nbetween them. Jekyll (who was composite) now with the most sensitive\napprehensions, now with a greedy gusto, projected and shared in the\npleasures and adventures of Hyde; but Hyde was indifferent to Jekyll, or\nbut remembered him as the mountain bandit remembers the cavern in\nwhich he conceals himself from pursuit. Jekyll had more than a father's\ninterest; Hyde had more than a son's indifference. To cast in my lot\nwith Jekyll, was to die to those appetites which I had long secretly\nindulged and had of late begun to pamper. To cast it in with Hyde, was\nto die to a thousand interests and aspirations, and to become, at a blow\nand forever, despised and friendless. The bargain might appear unequal;\nbut there was still another consideration in the scales; for while\nJekyll would suffer smartingly in the fires of abstinence, Hyde would be\nnot even conscious of all that he had lost. Strange as my circumstances\nwere, the terms of this debate are as old and commonplace as man;\nmuch the same inducements and alarms cast the die for any tempted and\ntrembling sinner; and it fell out with me, as it falls with so vast\na majority of my fellows, that I chose the better part and was found\nwanting in the strength to keep to it.\n\nYes, I preferred the elderly and discontented doctor, surrounded by\nfriends and cherishing honest hopes; and bade a resolute farewell to\nthe liberty, the comparative youth, the light step, leaping impulses\nand secret pleasures, that I had enjoyed in the disguise of Hyde. I made\nthis choice perhaps with some unconscious reservation, for I neither\ngave up the house in Soho, nor destroyed the clothes of Edward Hyde,\nwhich still lay ready in my cabinet. For two months, however, I was true\nto my determination; for two months, I led a life of such severity as\nI had never before attained to, and enjoyed the compensations of an\napproving conscience. But time began at last to obliterate the freshness\nof my alarm; the praises of conscience began to grow into a thing of\ncourse; I began to be tortured with throes and longings, as of Hyde\nstruggling after freedom; and at last, in an hour of moral weakness, I\nonce again compounded and swallowed the transforming draught.\n\nI do not suppose that, when a drunkard reasons with himself upon his\nvice, he is once out of five hundred times affected by the dangers that\nhe runs through his brutish, physical insensibility; neither had I, long\nas I had considered my position, made enough allowance for the complete\nmoral insensibility and insensate readiness to evil, which were the\nleading characters of Edward Hyde. Yet it was by these that I was\npunished. My devil had been long caged, he came out roaring. I was\nconscious, even when I took the draught, of a more unbridled, a more\nfurious propensity to ill. It must have been this, I suppose, that\nstirred in my soul that tempest of impatience with which I listened to\nthe civilities of my unhappy victim; I declare, at least, before God, no\nman morally sane could have been guilty of that crime upon so pitiful a\nprovocation; and that I struck in no more reasonable spirit than that in\nwhich a sick child may break a plaything. But I had voluntarily stripped\nmyself of all those balancing instincts by which even the worst of us\ncontinues to walk with some degree of steadiness among temptations; and\nin my case, to be tempted, however slightly, was to fall.\n\nInstantly the spirit of hell awoke in me and raged. With a transport of\nglee, I mauled the unresisting body, tasting delight from every blow;\nand it was not till weariness had begun to succeed, that I was suddenly,\nin the top fit of my delirium, struck through the heart by a cold thrill\nof terror. A mist dispersed; I saw my life to be forfeit; and fled from\nthe scene of these excesses, at once glorying and trembling, my lust of\nevil gratified and stimulated, my love of life screwed to the topmost\npeg. I ran to the house in Soho, and (to make assurance doubly sure)\ndestroyed my papers; thence I set out through the lamplit streets, in\nthe same divided ecstasy of mind, gloating on my crime, light-headedly\ndevising others in the future, and yet still hastening and still\nhearkening in my wake for the steps of the avenger. Hyde had a song upon\nhis lips as he compounded the draught, and as he drank it, pledged the\ndead man. The pangs of transformation had not done tearing him, before\nHenry Jekyll, with streaming tears of gratitude and remorse, had\nfallen upon his knees and lifted his clasped hands to God. The veil of\nself-indulgence was rent from head to foot. I saw my life as a whole:\nI followed it up from the days of childhood, when I had walked with my\nfather's hand, and through the self-denying toils of my professional\nlife, to arrive again and again, with the same sense of unreality, at\nthe damned horrors of the evening. I could have screamed aloud; I sought\nwith tears and prayers to smother down the crowd of hideous images and\nsounds with which my memory swarmed against me; and still, between the\npetitions, the ugly face of my iniquity stared into my soul. As the\nacuteness of this remorse began to die away, it was succeeded by a\nsense of joy. The problem of my conduct was solved. Hyde was thenceforth\nimpossible; whether I would or not, I was now confined to the better\npart of my existence; and O, how I rejoiced to think of it! with what\nwilling humility I embraced anew the restrictions of natural life! with\nwhat sincere renunciation I locked the door by which I had so often gone\nand come, and ground the key under my heel!\n\nThe next day, came the news that the murder had not been overlooked,\nthat the guilt of Hyde was patent to the world, and that the victim was\na man high in public estimation. It was not only a crime, it had been a\ntragic folly. I think I was glad to know it; I think I was glad to have\nmy better impulses thus buttressed and guarded by the terrors of the\nscaffold. Jekyll was now my city of refuge; let but Hyde peep out an\ninstant, and the hands of all men would be raised to take and slay him.\n\nI resolved in my future conduct to redeem the past; and I can say with\nhonesty that my resolve was fruitful of some good. You know yourself how\nearnestly, in the last months of the last year, I laboured to relieve\nsuffering; you know that much was done for others, and that the days\npassed quietly, almost happily for myself. Nor can I truly say that I\nwearied of this beneficent and innocent life; I think instead that I\ndaily enjoyed it more completely; but I was still cursed with my duality\nof purpose; and as the first edge of my penitence wore off, the lower\nside of me, so long indulged, so recently chained down, began to growl\nfor licence. Not that I dreamed of resuscitating Hyde; the bare idea of\nthat would startle me to frenzy: no, it was in my own person that I\nwas once more tempted to trifle with my conscience; and it was as\nan ordinary secret sinner that I at last fell before the assaults of\ntemptation.\n\nThere comes an end to all things; the most capacious measure is filled\nat last; and this brief condescension to my evil finally destroyed the\nbalance of my soul. And yet I was not alarmed; the fall seemed natural,\nlike a return to the old days before I had made my discovery. It was a\nfine, clear, January day, wet under foot where the frost had melted, but\ncloudless overhead; and the Regent's Park was full of winter chirrupings\nand sweet with spring odours. I sat in the sun on a bench; the animal\nwithin me licking the chops of memory; the spiritual side a little\ndrowsed, promising subsequent penitence, but not yet moved to begin.\nAfter all, I reflected, I was like my neighbours; and then I smiled,\ncomparing myself with other men, comparing my active good-will with\nthe lazy cruelty of their neglect. And at the very moment of that\nvainglorious thought, a qualm came over me, a horrid nausea and the most\ndeadly shuddering. These passed away, and left me faint; and then as\nin its turn faintness subsided, I began to be aware of a change in\nthe temper of my thoughts, a greater boldness, a contempt of danger,\na solution of the bonds of obligation. I looked down; my clothes hung\nformlessly on my shrunken limbs; the hand that lay on my knee was corded\nand hairy. I was once more Edward Hyde. A moment before I had been safe\nof all men's respect, wealthy, beloved--the cloth laying for me in the\ndining-room at home; and now I was the common quarry of mankind, hunted,\nhouseless, a known murderer, thrall to the gallows.\n\nMy reason wavered, but it did not fail me utterly. I have more than once\nobserved that in my second character, my faculties seemed sharpened to\na point and my spirits more tensely elastic; thus it came about that,\nwhere Jekyll perhaps might have succumbed, Hyde rose to the importance\nof the moment. My drugs were in one of the presses of my cabinet; how\nwas I to reach them? That was the problem that (crushing my temples in\nmy hands) I set myself to solve. The laboratory door I had closed. If\nI sought to enter by the house, my own servants would consign me to the\ngallows. I saw I must employ another hand, and thought of Lanyon. How\nwas he to be reached? how persuaded? Supposing that I escaped capture in\nthe streets, how was I to make my way into his presence? and how should\nI, an unknown and displeasing visitor, prevail on the famous physician\nto rifle the study of his colleague, Dr. Jekyll? Then I remembered that\nof my original character, one part remained to me: I could write my own\nhand; and once I had conceived that kindling spark, the way that I must\nfollow became lighted up from end to end.\n\nThereupon, I arranged my clothes as best I could, and summoning a\npassing hansom, drove to an hotel in Portland Street, the name of\nwhich I chanced to remember. At my appearance (which was indeed comical\nenough, however tragic a fate these garments covered) the driver could\nnot conceal his mirth. I gnashed my teeth upon him with a gust of\ndevilish fury; and the smile withered from his face--happily for\nhim--yet more happily for myself, for in another instant I had certainly\ndragged him from his perch. At the inn, as I entered, I looked about me\nwith so black a countenance as made the attendants tremble; not a look\ndid they exchange in my presence; but obsequiously took my orders,\nled me to a private room, and brought me wherewithal to write. Hyde\nin danger of his life was a creature new to me; shaken with inordinate\nanger, strung to the pitch of murder, lusting to inflict pain. Yet the\ncreature was astute; mastered his fury with a great effort of the will;\ncomposed his two important letters, one to Lanyon and one to Poole; and\nthat he might receive actual evidence of their being posted, sent them\nout with directions that they should be registered. Thenceforward, he\nsat all day over the fire in the private room, gnawing his nails; there\nhe dined, sitting alone with his fears, the waiter visibly quailing\nbefore his eye; and thence, when the night was fully come, he set forth\nin the corner of a closed cab, and was driven to and fro about the\nstreets of the city. He, I say--I cannot say, I. That child of Hell had\nnothing human; nothing lived in him but fear and hatred. And when at\nlast, thinking the driver had begun to grow suspicious, he discharged\nthe cab and ventured on foot, attired in his misfitting clothes, an\nobject marked out for observation, into the midst of the nocturnal\npassengers, these two base passions raged within him like a tempest.\nHe walked fast, hunted by his fears, chattering to himself, skulking\nthrough the less frequented thoroughfares, counting the minutes that\nstill divided him from midnight. Once a woman spoke to him, offering, I\nthink, a box of lights. He smote her in the face, and she fled.\n\nWhen I came to myself at Lanyon's, the horror of my old friend perhaps\naffected me somewhat: I do not know; it was at least but a drop in\nthe sea to the abhorrence with which I looked back upon these hours. A\nchange had come over me. It was no longer the fear of the gallows,\nit was the horror of being Hyde that racked me. I received Lanyon's\ncondemnation partly in a dream; it was partly in a dream that I came\nhome to my own house and got into bed. I slept after the prostration\nof the day, with a stringent and profound slumber which not even the\nnightmares that wrung me could avail to break. I awoke in the morning\nshaken, weakened, but refreshed. I still hated and feared the thought\nof the brute that slept within me, and I had not of course forgotten the\nappalling dangers of the day before; but I was once more at home, in my\nown house and close to my drugs; and gratitude for my escape shone so\nstrong in my soul that it almost rivalled the brightness of hope.\n\nI was stepping leisurely across the court after breakfast, drinking\nthe chill of the air with pleasure, when I was seized again with those\nindescribable sensations that heralded the change; and I had but the\ntime to gain the shelter of my cabinet, before I was once again raging\nand freezing with the passions of Hyde. It took on this occasion a\ndouble dose to recall me to myself; and alas! six hours after, as I sat\nlooking sadly in the fire, the pangs returned, and the drug had to be\nre-administered. In short, from that day forth it seemed only by a great\neffort as of gymnastics, and only under the immediate stimulation of the\ndrug, that I was able to wear the countenance of Jekyll. At all hours of\nthe day and night, I would be taken with the premonitory shudder; above\nall, if I slept, or even dozed for a moment in my chair, it was always\nas Hyde that I awakened. Under the strain of this continually impending\ndoom and by the sleeplessness to which I now condemned myself, ay, even\nbeyond what I had thought possible to man, I became, in my own person, a\ncreature eaten up and emptied by fever, languidly weak both in body and\nmind, and solely occupied by one thought: the horror of my other self.\nBut when I slept, or when the virtue of the medicine wore off, I would\nleap almost without transition (for the pangs of transformation grew\ndaily less marked) into the possession of a fancy brimming with images\nof terror, a soul boiling with causeless hatreds, and a body that seemed\nnot strong enough to contain the raging energies of life. The powers of\nHyde seemed to have grown with the sickliness of Jekyll. And certainly\nthe hate that now divided them was equal on each side. With Jekyll, it\nwas a thing of vital instinct. He had now seen the full deformity\nof that creature that shared with him some of the phenomena of\nconsciousness, and was co-heir with him to death: and beyond these links\nof community, which in themselves made the most poignant part of\nhis distress, he thought of Hyde, for all his energy of life, as of\nsomething not only hellish but inorganic. This was the shocking thing;\nthat the slime of the pit seemed to utter cries and voices; that the\namorphous dust gesticulated and sinned; that what was dead, and had\nno shape, should usurp the offices of life. And this again, that that\ninsurgent horror was knit to him closer than a wife, closer than an eye;\nlay caged in his flesh, where he heard it mutter and felt it struggle\nto be born; and at every hour of weakness, and in the confidence of\nslumber, prevailed against him, and deposed him out of life. The hatred\nof Hyde for Jekyll was of a different order. His terror of the gallows\ndrove him continually to commit temporary suicide, and return to his\nsubordinate station of a part instead of a person; but he loathed the\nnecessity, he loathed the despondency into which Jekyll was now fallen,\nand he resented the dislike with which he was himself regarded. Hence\nthe ape-like tricks that he would play me, scrawling in my own hand\nblasphemies on the pages of my books, burning the letters and destroying\nthe portrait of my father; and indeed, had it not been for his fear of\ndeath, he would long ago have ruined himself in order to involve me in\nthe ruin. But his love of me is wonderful; I go further: I, who sicken\nand freeze at the mere thought of him, when I recall the abjection and\npassion of this attachment, and when I know how he fears my power to cut\nhim off by suicide, I find it in my heart to pity him.\n\nIt is useless, and the time awfully fails me, to prolong this\ndescription; no one has ever suffered such torments, let that suffice;\nand yet even to these, habit brought--no, not alleviation--but a\ncertain callousness of soul, a certain acquiescence of despair; and my\npunishment might have gone on for years, but for the last calamity which\nhas now fallen, and which has finally severed me from my own face and\nnature. My provision of the salt, which had never been renewed since the\ndate of the first experiment, began to run low. I sent out for a fresh\nsupply and mixed the draught; the ebullition followed, and the first\nchange of colour, not the second; I drank it and it was without\nefficiency. You will learn from Poole how I have had London ransacked;\nit was in vain; and I am now persuaded that my first supply was impure,\nand that it was that unknown impurity which lent efficacy to the\ndraught.\n\nAbout a week has passed, and I am now finishing this statement under the\ninfluence of the last of the old powders. This, then, is the last time,\nshort of a miracle, that Henry Jekyll can think his own thoughts or see\nhis own face (now how sadly altered!) in the glass. Nor must I delay\ntoo long to bring my writing to an end; for if my narrative has hitherto\nescaped destruction, it has been by a combination of great prudence\nand great good luck. Should the throes of change take me in the act of\nwriting it, Hyde will tear it in pieces; but if some time shall\nhave elapsed after I have laid it by, his wonderful selfishness and\ncircumscription to the moment will probably save it once again from the\naction of his ape-like spite. And indeed the doom that is closing on us\nboth has already changed and crushed him. Half an hour from now, when\nI shall again and forever reindue that hated personality, I know how I\nshall sit shuddering and weeping in my chair, or continue, with the most\nstrained and fearstruck ecstasy of listening, to pace up and down this\nroom (my last earthly refuge) and give ear to every sound of menace.\nWill Hyde die upon the scaffold? or will he find courage to release\nhimself at the last moment? God knows; I am careless; this is my true\nhour of death, and what is to follow concerns another than myself. Here\nthen, as I lay down the pen and proceed to seal up my confession, I\nbring the life of that unhappy Henry Jekyll to an end.", "title": "The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde"}
