{"summary": "Sir Leicester Dedlock and Honoria, Lady Dedlock (his junior by more than 20 years) live at his estate of Chesney Wold. Lady Dedlock is a beautiful, haughty woman who is very admired in the social world because of her good looks, fine clothes and regal bearing. Her comings and goings are considered the choicest gossip among the \"fashionable intelligence.\" Unknown to Sir Leicester, Lady Dedlock had a lover, Captain Hawdon, before she married Sir Leicester – and had a child by him, Esther Summerson. Lady Dedlock, believing her daughter is dead, has chosen to live out her days 'bored to death' as a fashionable lady of the world.\nEsther is raised by Miss Barbary, Lady Dedlock's spartan sister, who instils a sense of worthlessness in her that Esther will battle throughout the novel. She holds a sort of depressed vigil on Esther's birthday each year, explaining that Esther's birth is no cause for celebration and that she was \"her mother's shame.\" Esther doesn't know that Miss Barbary is her aunt, thinking of her only as her godmother. When Miss Barbary dies, the Chancery lawyer Conversation Kenge takes charge of Esther's future on the instruction of his client, John Jarndyce. Jarndyce becomes Esther's guardian, and after attending school in Reading for six years, Esther moves in with him at Bleak House, along with his wards, Richard Carstone and Ada Clare. Esther is to be Ada's companion.\n\nEsther soon befriends both Ada and Richard, who are cousins. They are beneficiaries in one of the wills at issue in Jarndyce and Jarndyce; their guardian is a beneficiary under another will, and in some undefined way the two wills conflict. No one realises that Esther (as Lady Dedlock's biological daughter) is also connected to Jarndyce and Jarndyce. Richard and Ada soon fall in love, but though Mr. Jarndyce doesn't oppose the match, he stipulates that Richard (who is inconstant) must first choose a profession. Richard first tries the medical profession, and Esther first meets the newly qualified Dr. Allan Woodcourt at the house of Richard's prospective tutor, Mr. Baynham Badger. When Richard mentions the prospect of gaining from the resolution of Jarndyce and Jarndyce, John Jarndyce beseeches him never to put faith in what he calls \"the family curse\".\nMeanwhile, Lady Dedlock is also a beneficiary under one of the wills in Jarndyce and Jarndyce. Early in the book, while listening to her solicitor, the close-mouthed but shrewd Mr. Tulkinghorn, read an affidavit aloud, she recognises the handwriting on the copy. The sight affects her so much that she almost faints, which Tulkinghorn notes and thinks should be investigated. He traces the copyist who turns out to be a pauper known only as \"Nemo\" who has recently died. The only person to identify him is a street-sweeper, a poor homeless boy named Jo.\n\nLady Dedlock also investigates the matter disguised as her French maid, Mademoiselle Hortense. She pays Jo to take her to Nemo's grave. Meanwhile, Tulkinghorn is convinced that Lady Dedlock's secret might threaten the interests of his client, Sir Leicester Dedlock, and watches her constantly, even enlisting the help of the maid, who detests her. He also enlists Inspector Bucket to run Jo out of town, so that there are no loose-ends that might connect Nemo to the Dedlocks.\nEsther meets her mother at church and talks with her later at Chesney Wold – though, at first, neither woman recognises the tie that binds them. Later, Lady Dedlock realises that her abandoned child is not dead and is, in fact, Esther. She waits to confront Esther with this knowledge until Esther survives an unidentified disease (possibly smallpox, as it permanently disfigures her), which she got from the homeless boy Jo after Esther and her maid Charley attempted to nurse him back to health. Though they are happy to be reunited, Lady Dedlock tells Esther that they must never acknowledge their connection again.\nEsther recovers, but her beauty is supposedly ruined. She finds that Richard, having failed at several professions, has ignored his guardian and is wasting his resources in pushing Jarndyce and Jarndyce to conclusion (in his and Ada's favour). Further, he has broken with his guardian, under the influence of his lawyer, the odious and crafty Mr. Vholes. In the process of becoming an active litigant, Richard has lost all his money and is breaking his health. In further defiance of John Jarndyce, he and Ada have secretly married, and Ada is carrying Richard's child. Esther experiences her own romance when Dr. Woodcourt returns to England, having survived a shipwreck, and continues to seek her company despite her disfigurement. Unfortunately, Esther has already agreed to marry her guardian, John Jarndyce.\nHortense and Tulkinghorn discover the truth about Lady Dedlock's past. After a quiet but desperate confrontation with the lawyer, Lady Dedlock flees her home, leaving a note apologising for her conduct. Tulkinghorn dismisses Hortense, who is no longer of any use to him. Feeling abandoned and betrayed by Lady Dedlock and Tulkinghorn, Hortense kills Tulkinghorn and seeks to frame Lady Dedlock for his murder. Sir Leicester discovers his lawyer's death and his wife's flight, and he suffers a catastrophic stroke but manages to communicate that he forgives his wife and wants her to return to him.\n\nInspector Bucket, who up to now has investigated several matters on the periphery of Jarndyce and Jarndyce, accepts the commission of the stricken Sir Leicester to find Lady Dedlock. He suspects Lady Dedlock, even after he arrests George Rouncewell (the only other person known to be with Tulkinghorn on the night of the murder and to have quarrelled with him repeatedly). Bucket asks Esther to help search for Lady Dedlock. By this point, Bucket has cleared Lady Dedlock by discovering Hortense's guilt, but Lady Dedlock has no way to know this and wanders the country in cold weather before dying at the cemetery of her former lover Captain Hawdon (Nemo). Esther and Bucket find her there.\nDevelopments in Jarndyce and Jarndyce seem to take a turn for the better when a later will is found which revokes all previous wills and leaves the bulk of the estate to Richard and Ada. Meanwhile, John Jarndyce cancels his engagement to Esther, who becomes engaged to Dr. Woodcourt. They go to Chancery to find Richard and to discover what news there might be of the lawsuit's resolution. On their arrival, they learn that the case of Jarndyce and Jarndyce is finally over, since the costs of litigation have entirely consumed the estate. Richard collapses, and Dr Woodcourt determines that he is in the last stages of tuberculosis. Richard apologises to John Jarndyce and dies, leaving Ada alone with their child, a boy she names Richard. Jarndyce takes in Ada and the child. Esther and Woodcourt marry and live in a Yorkshire house which Jarndyce gives to them. In time, they have two daughters.\nMany of this intricate novel's subplots deal with the minor characters and their diverse ties to the main plot. One of these subplots is the hard life and happy though difficult marriage of Caddy Jellyby and Prince Turveydrop. Another focuses on George Rouncewell's rediscovery of his family and his reunion with his mother and brother.\n\n", "full_text": "and revised by Thomas Berger and Joseph E.

The Close of Esther's Narrative\n\n\n\n\nPREFACE\n\n\nA Chancery judge once had the kindness to inform me, as one of a\ncompany of some hundred and fifty men and women not labouring under\nany suspicions of lunacy, that the Court of Chancery, though the\nshining subject of much popular prejudice (at which point I thought\nthe judge's eye had a cast in my direction), was almost immaculate.\nThere had been, he admitted, a trivial blemish or so in its rate of\nprogress, but this was exaggerated and had been entirely owing to the\n\"parsimony of the public,\" which guilty public, it appeared, had been\nuntil lately bent in the most determined manner on by no means\nenlarging the number of Chancery judges appointed--I believe by\nRichard the Second, but any other king will do as well.\n\nThis seemed to me too profound a joke to be inserted in the body of\nthis book or I should have restored it to Conversation Kenge or to\nMr. Vholes, with one or other of whom I think it must have\noriginated. In such mouths I might have coupled it with an apt\nquotation from one of Shakespeare's sonnets:\n\n                     \"My nature is subdued\n   To what it works in, like the dyer's hand:\n   Pity me, then, and wish I were renewed!\"\n\nBut as it is wholesome that the parsimonious public should know what\nhas been doing, and still is doing, in this connexion, I mention here\nthat everything set forth in these pages concerning the Court of\nChancery is substantially true, and within the truth. The case of\nGridley is in no essential altered from one of actual occurrence,\nmade public by a disinterested person who was professionally\nacquainted with the whole of the monstrous wrong from beginning to\nend. At the present moment (August, 1853) there is a suit before the\ncourt which was commenced nearly twenty years ago, in which from\nthirty to forty counsel have been known to appear at one time, in\nwhich costs have been incurred to the amount of seventy thousand\npounds, which is A FRIENDLY SUIT, and which is (I am assured) no\nnearer to its termination now than when it was begun. There is\nanother well-known suit in Chancery, not yet decided, which was\ncommenced before the close of the last century and in which more than\ndouble the amount of seventy thousand pounds has been swallowed up in\ncosts. If I wanted other authorities for Jarndyce and Jarndyce, I\ncould rain them on these pages, to the shame of--a parsimonious\npublic.\n\nThere is only one other point on which I offer a word of remark. The\npossibility of what is called spontaneous combustion has been denied\nsince the death of Mr. Krook; and my good friend Mr. Lewes (quite\nmistaken, as he soon found, in supposing the thing to have been\nabandoned by all authorities) published some ingenious letters to me\nat the time when that event was chronicled, arguing that spontaneous\ncombustion could not possibly be. I have no need to observe that I do\nnot wilfully or negligently mislead my readers and that before I\nwrote that description I took pains to investigate the subject. There\nare about thirty cases on record, of which the most famous, that of\nthe Countess Cornelia de Baudi Cesenate, was minutely investigated\nand described by Giuseppe Bianchini, a prebendary of Verona,\notherwise distinguished in letters, who published an account of it at\nVerona in 1731, which he afterwards republished at Rome. The\nappearances, beyond all rational doubt, observed in that case are the\nappearances observed in Mr. Krook's case. The next most famous\ninstance happened at Rheims six years earlier, and the historian in\nthat case is Le Cat, one of the most renowned surgeons produced by\nFrance. The subject was a woman, whose husband was ignorantly\nconvicted of having murdered her; but on solemn appeal to a higher\ncourt, he was acquitted because it was shown upon the evidence that\nshe had died the death of which this name of spontaneous combustion\nis given. I do not think it necessary to add to these notable facts,\nand that general reference to the authorities which will be found at\npage 30, vol. ii.,* the recorded opinions and experiences of\ndistinguished medical professors, French, English, and Scotch, in\nmore modern days, contenting myself with observing that I shall not\nabandon the facts until there shall have been a considerable\nspontaneous combustion of the testimony on which human occurrences\nare usually received.**\n\nIn Bleak House I have purposely dwelt upon the romantic side of\nfamiliar things.\n\n\n1853\n\n\n   *Transcriber's note. This referred to a specific page in\n    the printed book. In this Project Gutenberg edition the\n    pertinent information is in Chapter XXX, paragraph 90.\n\n   ** Another case, very clearly described by a dentist,\n    occurred at the town of Columbus, in the United States\n    of America, quite recently. The subject was a German who\n    kept a liquor-shop and was an inveterate drunkard.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I\n\nIn Chancery\n\n\nLondon. Michaelmas term lately over, and the Lord Chancellor sitting\nin Lincoln's Inn Hall. Implacable November weather. As much mud in\nthe streets as if the waters had but newly retired from the face of\nthe earth, and it would not be wonderful to meet a Megalosaurus,\nforty feet long or so, waddling like an elephantine lizard up Holborn\nHill. Smoke lowering down from chimney-pots, making a soft black\ndrizzle, with flakes of soot in it as big as full-grown\nsnowflakes--gone into mourning, one might imagine, for the death of\nthe sun. Dogs, undistinguishable in mire. Horses, scarcely better;\nsplashed to their very blinkers. Foot passengers, jostling one\nanother's umbrellas in a general infection of ill temper, and losing\ntheir foot-hold at street-corners, where tens of thousands of other\nfoot passengers have been slipping and sliding since the day broke\n(if this day ever broke), adding new deposits to the crust upon crust\nof mud, sticking at those points tenaciously to the pavement, and\naccumulating at compound interest.\n\nFog everywhere. Fog up the river, where it flows among green aits and\nmeadows; fog down the river, where it rolls defiled among the tiers\nof shipping and the waterside pollutions of a great (and dirty) city.\nFog on the Essex marshes, fog on the Kentish heights. Fog creeping\ninto the cabooses of collier-brigs; fog lying out on the yards and\nhovering in the rigging of great ships; fog drooping on the gunwales\nof barges and small boats. Fog in the eyes and throats of ancient\nGreenwich pensioners, wheezing by the firesides of their wards; fog\nin the stem and bowl of the afternoon pipe of the wrathful skipper,\ndown in his close cabin; fog cruelly pinching the toes and fingers of\nhis shivering little 'prentice boy on deck. Chance people on the\nbridges peeping over the parapets into a nether sky of fog, with fog\nall round them, as if they were up in a balloon and hanging in the\nmisty clouds.\n\nGas looming through the fog in divers places in the streets, much as\nthe sun may, from the spongey fields, be seen to loom by husbandman\nand ploughboy. Most of the shops lighted two hours before their\ntime--as the gas seems to know, for it has a haggard and unwilling\nlook.\n\nThe raw afternoon is rawest, and the dense fog is densest, and the\nmuddy streets are muddiest near that leaden-headed old obstruction,\nappropriate ornament for the threshold of a leaden-headed old\ncorporation, Temple Bar. And hard by Temple Bar, in Lincoln's Inn\nHall, at the very heart of the fog, sits the Lord High Chancellor in\nhis High Court of Chancery.\n\nNever can there come fog too thick, never can there come mud and mire\ntoo deep, to assort with the groping and floundering condition which\nthis High Court of Chancery, most pestilent of hoary sinners, holds\nthis day in the sight of heaven and earth.\n\nOn such an afternoon, if ever, the Lord High Chancellor ought to be\nsitting here--as here he is--with a foggy glory round his head,\nsoftly fenced in with crimson cloth and curtains, addressed by a\nlarge advocate with great whiskers, a little voice, and an\ninterminable brief, and outwardly directing his contemplation to the\nlantern in the roof, where he can see nothing but fog. On such an\nafternoon some score of members of the High Court of Chancery bar\nought to be--as here they are--mistily engaged in one of the ten\nthousand stages of an endless cause, tripping one another up on\nslippery precedents, groping knee-deep in technicalities, running\ntheir goat-hair and horsehair warded heads against walls of words and\nmaking a pretence of equity with serious faces, as players might. On\nsuch an afternoon the various solicitors in the cause, some two or\nthree of whom have inherited it from their fathers, who made a\nfortune by it, ought to be--as are they not?--ranged in a line, in a\nlong matted well (but you might look in vain for truth at the bottom\nof it) between the registrar's red table and the silk gowns, with\nbills, cross-bills, answers, rejoinders, injunctions, affidavits,\nissues, references to masters, masters' reports, mountains of costly\nnonsense, piled before them. Well may the court be dim, with wasting\ncandles here and there; well may the fog hang heavy in it, as if it\nwould never get out; well may the stained-glass windows lose their\ncolour and admit no light of day into the place; well may the\nuninitiated from the streets, who peep in through the glass panes in\nthe door, be deterred from entrance by its owlish aspect and by the\ndrawl, languidly echoing to the roof from the padded dais where the\nLord High Chancellor looks into the lantern that has no light in it\nand where the attendant wigs are all stuck in a fog-bank! This is the\nCourt of Chancery, which has its decaying houses and its blighted\nlands in every shire, which has its worn-out lunatic in every\nmadhouse and its dead in every churchyard, which has its ruined\nsuitor with his slipshod heels and threadbare dress borrowing and\nbegging through the round of every man's acquaintance, which gives to\nmonied might the means abundantly of wearying out the right, which so\nexhausts finances, patience, courage, hope, so overthrows the brain\nand breaks the heart, that there is not an honourable man among its\npractitioners who would not give--who does not often give--the\nwarning, \"Suffer any wrong that can be done you rather than come\nhere!\"\n\nWho happen to be in the Lord Chancellor's court this murky afternoon\nbesides the Lord Chancellor, the counsel in the cause, two or three\ncounsel who are never in any cause, and the well of solicitors before\nmentioned? There is the registrar below the judge, in wig and gown;\nand there are two or three maces, or petty-bags, or privy purses, or\nwhatever they may be, in legal court suits. These are all yawning,\nfor no crumb of amusement ever falls from Jarndyce and Jarndyce (the\ncause in hand), which was squeezed dry years upon years ago. The\nshort-hand writers, the reporters of the court, and the reporters of\nthe newspapers invariably decamp with the rest of the regulars when\nJarndyce and Jarndyce comes on. Their places are a blank. Standing on\na seat at the side of the hall, the better to peer into the curtained\nsanctuary, is a little mad old woman in a squeezed bonnet who is\nalways in court, from its sitting to its rising, and always expecting\nsome incomprehensible judgment to be given in her favour. Some say\nshe really is, or was, a party to a suit, but no one knows for\ncertain because no one cares. She carries some small litter in a\nreticule which she calls her documents, principally consisting of\npaper matches and dry lavender. A sallow prisoner has come up, in\ncustody, for the half-dozenth time to make a personal application \"to\npurge himself of his contempt,\" which, being a solitary surviving\nexecutor who has fallen into a state of conglomeration about accounts\nof which it is not pretended that he had ever any knowledge, he is\nnot at all likely ever to do. In the meantime his prospects in life\nare ended. Another ruined suitor, who periodically appears from\nShropshire and breaks out into efforts to address the Chancellor at\nthe close of the day's business and who can by no means be made to\nunderstand that the Chancellor is legally ignorant of his existence\nafter making it desolate for a quarter of a century, plants himself\nin a good place and keeps an eye on the judge, ready to call out \"My\nLord!\" in a voice of sonorous complaint on the instant of his rising.\nA few lawyers' clerks and others who know this suitor by sight linger\non the chance of his furnishing some fun and enlivening the dismal\nweather a little.\n\nJarndyce and Jarndyce drones on. This scarecrow of a suit has, in\ncourse of time, become so complicated that no man alive knows what it\nmeans. The parties to it understand it least, but it has been\nobserved that no two Chancery lawyers can talk about it for five\nminutes without coming to a total disagreement as to all the\npremises. Innumerable children have been born into the cause;\ninnumerable young people have married into it; innumerable old people\nhave died out of it. Scores of persons have deliriously found\nthemselves made parties in Jarndyce and Jarndyce without knowing how\nor why; whole families have inherited legendary hatreds with the\nsuit. The little plaintiff or defendant who was promised a new\nrocking-horse when Jarndyce and Jarndyce should be settled has grown\nup, possessed himself of a real horse, and trotted away into the\nother world. Fair wards of court have faded into mothers and\ngrandmothers; a long procession of Chancellors has come in and gone\nout; the legion of bills in the suit have been transformed into mere\nbills of mortality; there are not three Jarndyces left upon the earth\nperhaps since old Tom Jarndyce in despair blew his brains out at a\ncoffee-house in Chancery Lane; but Jarndyce and Jarndyce still drags\nits dreary length before the court, perennially hopeless.\n\nJarndyce and Jarndyce has passed into a joke. That is the only good\nthat has ever come of it. It has been death to many, but it is a joke\nin the profession. Every master in Chancery has had a reference out\nof it. Every Chancellor was \"in it,\" for somebody or other, when he\nwas counsel at the bar. Good things have been said about it by\nblue-nosed, bulbous-shoed old benchers in select port-wine committee\nafter dinner in hall. Articled clerks have been in the habit of\nfleshing their legal wit upon it. The last Lord Chancellor handled it\nneatly, when, correcting Mr. Blowers, the eminent silk gown who said\nthat such a thing might happen when the sky rained potatoes, he\nobserved, \"or when we get through Jarndyce and Jarndyce, Mr.\nBlowers\"--a pleasantry that particularly tickled the maces, bags, and\npurses.\n\nHow many people out of the suit Jarndyce and Jarndyce has stretched\nforth its unwholesome hand to spoil and corrupt would be a very wide\nquestion. From the master upon whose impaling files reams of dusty\nwarrants in Jarndyce and Jarndyce have grimly writhed into many\nshapes, down to the copying-clerk in the Six Clerks' Office who has\ncopied his tens of thousands of Chancery folio-pages under that\neternal heading, no man's nature has been made better by it. In\ntrickery, evasion, procrastination, spoliation, botheration, under\nfalse pretences of all sorts, there are influences that can never\ncome to good. The very solicitors' boys who have kept the wretched\nsuitors at bay, by protesting time out of mind that Mr. Chizzle,\nMizzle, or otherwise was particularly engaged and had appointments\nuntil dinner, may have got an extra moral twist and shuffle into\nthemselves out of Jarndyce and Jarndyce. The receiver in the cause\nhas acquired a goodly sum of money by it but has acquired too a\ndistrust of his own mother and a contempt for his own kind. Chizzle,\nMizzle, and otherwise have lapsed into a habit of vaguely promising\nthemselves that they will look into that outstanding little matter\nand see what can be done for Drizzle--who was not well used--when\nJarndyce and Jarndyce shall be got out of the office. Shirking and\nsharking in all their many varieties have been sown broadcast by the\nill-fated cause; and even those who have contemplated its history\nfrom the outermost circle of such evil have been insensibly tempted\ninto a loose way of letting bad things alone to take their own bad\ncourse, and a loose belief that if the world go wrong it was in some\noff-hand manner never meant to go right.\n\nThus, in the midst of the mud and at the heart of the fog, sits the\nLord High Chancellor in his High Court of Chancery.\n\n\"Mr. Tangle,\" says the Lord High Chancellor, latterly something\nrestless under the eloquence of that learned gentleman.\n\n\"Mlud,\" says Mr. Tangle. Mr. Tangle knows more of Jarndyce and\nJarndyce than anybody. He is famous for it--supposed never to have\nread anything else since he left school.\n\n\"Have you nearly concluded your argument?\"\n\n\"Mlud, no--variety of points--feel it my duty tsubmit--ludship,\" is\nthe reply that slides out of Mr. Tangle.\n\n\"Several members of the bar are still to be heard, I believe?\" says\nthe Chancellor with a slight smile.\n\nEighteen of Mr. Tangle's learned friends, each armed with a little\nsummary of eighteen hundred sheets, bob up like eighteen hammers in a\npianoforte, make eighteen bows, and drop into their eighteen places\nof obscurity.\n\n\"We will proceed with the hearing on Wednesday fortnight,\" says the\nChancellor. For the question at issue is only a question of costs, a\nmere bud on the forest tree of the parent suit, and really will come\nto a settlement one of these days.\n\nThe Chancellor rises; the bar rises; the prisoner is brought forward\nin a hurry; the man from Shropshire cries, \"My lord!\" Maces, bags,\nand purses indignantly proclaim silence and frown at the man from\nShropshire.\n\n\"In reference,\" proceeds the Chancellor, still on Jarndyce and\nJarndyce, \"to the young girl--\"\n\n\"Begludship's pardon--boy,\" says Mr. Tangle prematurely. \"In\nreference,\" proceeds the Chancellor with extra distinctness, \"to the\nyoung girl and boy, the two young people\"--Mr. Tangle crushed--\"whom\nI directed to be in attendance to-day and who are now in my private\nroom, I will see them and satisfy myself as to the expediency of\nmaking the order for their residing with their uncle.\"\n\nMr. Tangle on his legs again. \"Begludship's pardon--dead.\"\n\n\"With their\"--Chancellor looking through his double eye-glass at the\npapers on his desk--\"grandfather.\"\n\n\"Begludship's pardon--victim of rash action--brains.\"\n\nSuddenly a very little counsel with a terrific bass voice arises,\nfully inflated, in the back settlements of the fog, and says, \"Will\nyour lordship allow me? I appear for him. He is a cousin, several\ntimes removed. I am not at the moment prepared to inform the court in\nwhat exact remove he is a cousin, but he IS a cousin.\"\n\nLeaving this address (delivered like a sepulchral message) ringing in\nthe rafters of the roof, the very little counsel drops, and the fog\nknows him no more. Everybody looks for him. Nobody can see him.\n\n\"I will speak with both the young people,\" says the Chancellor anew,\n\"and satisfy myself on the subject of their residing with their\ncousin. I will mention the matter to-morrow morning when I take my\nseat.\"\n\nThe Chancellor is about to bow to the bar when the prisoner is\npresented. Nothing can possibly come of the prisoner's conglomeration\nbut his being sent back to prison, which is soon done. The man from\nShropshire ventures another remonstrative \"My lord!\" but the\nChancellor, being aware of him, has dexterously vanished. Everybody\nelse quickly vanishes too. A battery of blue bags is loaded with\nheavy charges of papers and carried off by clerks; the little mad old\nwoman marches off with her documents; the empty court is locked up.\nIf all the injustice it has committed and all the misery it has\ncaused could only be locked up with it, and the whole burnt away in a\ngreat funeral pyre--why so much the better for other parties than the\nparties in Jarndyce and Jarndyce!\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II\n\nIn Fashion\n\n\nIt is but a glimpse of the world of fashion that we want on this same\nmiry afternoon. It is not so unlike the Court of Chancery but that we\nmay pass from the one scene to the other, as the crow flies. Both the\nworld of fashion and the Court of Chancery are things of precedent\nand usage: oversleeping Rip Van Winkles who have played at strange\ngames through a deal of thundery weather; sleeping beauties whom the\nknight will wake one day, when all the stopped spits in the kitchen\nshall begin to turn prodigiously!\n\nIt is not a large world. Relatively even to this world of ours, which\nhas its limits too (as your Highness shall find when you have made\nthe tour of it and are come to the brink of the void beyond), it is a\nvery little speck. There is much good in it; there are many good and\ntrue people in it; it has its appointed place. But the evil of it is\nthat it is a world wrapped up in too much jeweller's cotton and fine\nwool, and cannot hear the rushing of the larger worlds, and cannot\nsee them as they circle round the sun. It is a deadened world, and\nits growth is sometimes unhealthy for want of air.\n\nMy Lady Dedlock has returned to her house in town for a few days\nprevious to her departure for Paris, where her ladyship intends to\nstay some weeks, after which her movements are uncertain. The\nfashionable intelligence says so for the comfort of the Parisians,\nand it knows all fashionable things. To know things otherwise were to\nbe unfashionable. My Lady Dedlock has been down at what she calls, in\nfamiliar conversation, her \"place\" in Lincolnshire. The waters are\nout in Lincolnshire. An arch of the bridge in the park has been\nsapped and sopped away. The adjacent low-lying ground for half a mile\nin breadth is a stagnant river with melancholy trees for islands in\nit and a surface punctured all over, all day long, with falling rain.\nMy Lady Dedlock's place has been extremely dreary. The weather for\nmany a day and night has been so wet that the trees seem wet through,\nand the soft loppings and prunings of the woodman's axe can make no\ncrash or crackle as they fall. The deer, looking soaked, leave\nquagmires where they pass. The shot of a rifle loses its sharpness in\nthe moist air, and its smoke moves in a tardy little cloud towards\nthe green rise, coppice-topped, that makes a background for the\nfalling rain. The view from my Lady Dedlock's own windows is\nalternately a lead-coloured view and a view in Indian ink. The vases\non the stone terrace in the foreground catch the rain all day; and\nthe heavy drops fall--drip, drip, drip--upon the broad flagged\npavement, called from old time the Ghost's Walk, all night. On\nSundays the little church in the park is mouldy; the oaken pulpit\nbreaks out into a cold sweat; and there is a general smell and taste\nas of the ancient Dedlocks in their graves. My Lady Dedlock (who is\nchildless), looking out in the early twilight from her boudoir at a\nkeeper's lodge and seeing the light of a fire upon the latticed\npanes, and smoke rising from the chimney, and a child, chased by a\nwoman, running out into the rain to meet the shining figure of a\nwrapped-up man coming through the gate, has been put quite out of\ntemper. My Lady Dedlock says she has been \"bored to death.\"\n\nTherefore my Lady Dedlock has come away from the place in\nLincolnshire and has left it to the rain, and the crows, and the\nrabbits, and the deer, and the partridges and pheasants. The pictures\nof the Dedlocks past and gone have seemed to vanish into the damp\nwalls in mere lowness of spirits, as the housekeeper has passed along\nthe old rooms shutting up the shutters. And when they will next come\nforth again, the fashionable intelligence--which, like the fiend, is\nomniscient of the past and present, but not the future--cannot yet\nundertake to say.\n\nSir Leicester Dedlock is only a baronet, but there is no mightier\nbaronet than he. His family is as old as the hills, and infinitely\nmore respectable. He has a general opinion that the world might get\non without hills but would be done up without Dedlocks. He would on\nthe whole admit nature to be a good idea (a little low, perhaps, when\nnot enclosed with a park-fence), but an idea dependent for its\nexecution on your great county families. He is a gentleman of strict\nconscience, disdainful of all littleness and meanness and ready on\nthe shortest notice to die any death you may please to mention rather\nthan give occasion for the least impeachment of his integrity. He is\nan honourable, obstinate, truthful, high-spirited, intensely\nprejudiced, perfectly unreasonable man.\n\nSir Leicester is twenty years, full measure, older than my Lady. He\nwill never see sixty-five again, nor perhaps sixty-six, nor yet\nsixty-seven. He has a twist of the gout now and then and walks a\nlittle stiffly. He is of a worthy presence, with his light-grey hair\nand whiskers, his fine shirt-frill, his pure-white waistcoat, and his\nblue coat with bright buttons always buttoned. He is ceremonious,\nstately, most polite on every occasion to my Lady, and holds her\npersonal attractions in the highest estimation. His gallantry to my\nLady, which has never changed since he courted her, is the one little\ntouch of romantic fancy in him.\n\nIndeed, he married her for love. A whisper still goes about that she\nhad not even family; howbeit, Sir Leicester had so much family that\nperhaps he had enough and could dispense with any more. But she had\nbeauty, pride, ambition, insolent resolve, and sense enough to\nportion out a legion of fine ladies. Wealth and station, added to\nthese, soon floated her upward, and for years now my Lady Dedlock has\nbeen at the centre of the fashionable intelligence and at the top of\nthe fashionable tree.\n\nHow Alexander wept when he had no more worlds to conquer, everybody\nknows--or has some reason to know by this time, the matter having\nbeen rather frequently mentioned. My Lady Dedlock, having conquered\nHER world, fell not into the melting, but rather into the freezing,\nmood. An exhausted composure, a worn-out placidity, an equanimity of\nfatigue not to be ruffled by interest or satisfaction, are the\ntrophies of her victory. She is perfectly well-bred. If she could be\ntranslated to heaven to-morrow, she might be expected to ascend\nwithout any rapture.\n\nShe has beauty still, and if it be not in its heyday, it is not yet\nin its autumn. She has a fine face--originally of a character that\nwould be rather called very pretty than handsome, but improved into\nclassicality by the acquired expression of her fashionable state. Her\nfigure is elegant and has the effect of being tall. Not that she is\nso, but that \"the most is made,\" as the Honourable Bob Stables has\nfrequently asserted upon oath, \"of all her points.\" The same\nauthority observes that she is perfectly got up and remarks in\ncommendation of her hair especially that she is the best-groomed\nwoman in the whole stud.\n\nWith all her perfections on her head, my Lady Dedlock has come up\nfrom her place in Lincolnshire (hotly pursued by the fashionable\nintelligence) to pass a few days at her house in town previous to her\ndeparture for Paris, where her ladyship intends to stay some weeks,\nafter which her movements are uncertain. And at her house in town,\nupon this muddy, murky afternoon, presents himself an old-fashioned\nold gentleman, attorney-at-law and eke solicitor of the High Court of\nChancery, who has the honour of acting as legal adviser of the\nDedlocks and has as many cast-iron boxes in his office with that name\noutside as if the present baronet were the coin of the conjuror's\ntrick and were constantly being juggled through the whole set. Across\nthe hall, and up the stairs, and along the passages, and through the\nrooms, which are very brilliant in the season and very dismal out of\nit--fairy-land to visit, but a desert to live in--the old gentleman\nis conducted by a Mercury in powder to my Lady's presence.\n\nThe old gentleman is rusty to look at, but is reputed to have made\ngood thrift out of aristocratic marriage settlements and aristocratic\nwills, and to be very rich. He is surrounded by a mysterious halo of\nfamily confidences, of which he is known to be the silent depository.\nThere are noble mausoleums rooted for centuries in retired glades of\nparks among the growing timber and the fern, which perhaps hold fewer\nnoble secrets than walk abroad among men, shut up in the breast of\nMr. Tulkinghorn. He is of what is called the old school--a phrase\ngenerally meaning any school that seems never to have been young--and\nwears knee-breeches tied with ribbons, and gaiters or stockings. One\npeculiarity of his black clothes and of his black stockings, be they\nsilk or worsted, is that they never shine. Mute, close, irresponsive\nto any glancing light, his dress is like himself. He never converses\nwhen not professionally consulted. He is found sometimes, speechless\nbut quite at home, at corners of dinner-tables in great country\nhouses and near doors of drawing-rooms, concerning which the\nfashionable intelligence is eloquent, where everybody knows him and\nwhere half the Peerage stops to say \"How do you do, Mr. Tulkinghorn?\"\nHe receives these salutations with gravity and buries them along with\nthe rest of his knowledge.\n\nSir Leicester Dedlock is with my Lady and is happy to see Mr.\nTulkinghorn. There is an air of prescription about him which is\nalways agreeable to Sir Leicester; he receives it as a kind of\ntribute. He likes Mr. Tulkinghorn's dress; there is a kind of tribute\nin that too. It is eminently respectable, and likewise, in a general\nway, retainer-like. It expresses, as it were, the steward of the\nlegal mysteries, the butler of the legal cellar, of the Dedlocks.\n\nHas Mr. Tulkinghorn any idea of this himself? It may be so, or it may\nnot, but there is this remarkable circumstance to be noted in\neverything associated with my Lady Dedlock as one of a class--as one\nof the leaders and representatives of her little world. She supposes\nherself to be an inscrutable Being, quite out of the reach and ken of\nordinary mortals--seeing herself in her glass, where indeed she looks\nso. Yet every dim little star revolving about her, from her maid to\nthe manager of the Italian Opera, knows her weaknesses, prejudices,\nfollies, haughtinesses, and caprices and lives upon as accurate a\ncalculation and as nice a measure of her moral nature as her\ndressmaker takes of her physical proportions. Is a new dress, a new\ncustom, a new singer, a new dancer, a new form of jewellery, a new\ndwarf or giant, a new chapel, a new anything, to be set up? There are\ndeferential people in a dozen callings whom my Lady Dedlock suspects\nof nothing but prostration before her, who can tell you how to manage\nher as if she were a baby, who do nothing but nurse her all their\nlives, who, humbly affecting to follow with profound subservience,\nlead her and her whole troop after them; who, in hooking one, hook\nall and bear them off as Lemuel Gulliver bore away the stately fleet\nof the majestic Lilliput. \"If you want to address our people, sir,\"\nsay Blaze and Sparkle, the jewellers--meaning by our people Lady\nDedlock and the rest--\"you must remember that you are not dealing\nwith the general public; you must hit our people in their weakest\nplace, and their weakest place is such a place.\" \"To make this\narticle go down, gentlemen,\" say Sheen and Gloss, the mercers, to\ntheir friends the manufacturers, \"you must come to us, because we\nknow where to have the fashionable people, and we can make it\nfashionable.\" \"If you want to get this print upon the tables of my\nhigh connexion, sir,\" says Mr. Sladdery, the librarian, \"or if you\nwant to get this dwarf or giant into the houses of my high connexion,\nsir, or if you want to secure to this entertainment the patronage of\nmy high connexion, sir, you must leave it, if you please, to me, for\nI have been accustomed to study the leaders of my high connexion,\nsir, and I may tell you without vanity that I can turn them round my\nfinger\"--in which Mr. Sladdery, who is an honest man, does not\nexaggerate at all.\n\nTherefore, while Mr. Tulkinghorn may not know what is passing in the\nDedlock mind at present, it is very possible that he may.\n\n\"My Lady's cause has been again before the Chancellor, has it, Mr.\nTulkinghorn?\" says Sir Leicester, giving him his hand.\n\n\"Yes. It has been on again to-day,\" Mr. Tulkinghorn replies, making\none of his quiet bows to my Lady, who is on a sofa near the fire,\nshading her face with a hand-screen.\n\n\"It would be useless to ask,\" says my Lady with the dreariness of the\nplace in Lincolnshire still upon her, \"whether anything has been\ndone.\"\n\n\"Nothing that YOU would call anything has been done to-day,\" replies\nMr. Tulkinghorn.\n\n\"Nor ever will be,\" says my Lady.\n\nSir Leicester has no objection to an interminable Chancery suit. It\nis a slow, expensive, British, constitutional kind of thing. To be\nsure, he has not a vital interest in the suit in question, her part\nin which was the only property my Lady brought him; and he has a\nshadowy impression that for his name--the name of Dedlock--to be in a\ncause, and not in the title of that cause, is a most ridiculous\naccident. But he regards the Court of Chancery, even if it should\ninvolve an occasional delay of justice and a trifling amount of\nconfusion, as a something devised in conjunction with a variety of\nother somethings by the perfection of human wisdom for the eternal\nsettlement (humanly speaking) of everything. And he is upon the whole\nof a fixed opinion that to give the sanction of his countenance to\nany complaints respecting it would be to encourage some person in the\nlower classes to rise up somewhere--like Wat Tyler.\n\n\"As a few fresh affidavits have been put upon the file,\" says Mr.\nTulkinghorn, \"and as they are short, and as I proceed upon the\ntroublesome principle of begging leave to possess my clients with any\nnew proceedings in a cause\"--cautious man Mr. Tulkinghorn, taking no\nmore responsibility than necessary--\"and further, as I see you are\ngoing to Paris, I have brought them in my pocket.\"\n\n(Sir Leicester was going to Paris too, by the by, but the delight of\nthe fashionable intelligence was in his Lady.)\n\nMr. Tulkinghorn takes out his papers, asks permission to place them\non a golden talisman of a table at my Lady's elbow, puts on his\nspectacles, and begins to read by the light of a shaded lamp.\n\n\"'In Chancery. Between John Jarndyce--'\"\n\nMy Lady interrupts, requesting him to miss as many of the formal\nhorrors as he can.\n\nMr. Tulkinghorn glances over his spectacles and begins again lower\ndown. My Lady carelessly and scornfully abstracts her attention. Sir\nLeicester in a great chair looks at the file and appears to have a\nstately liking for the legal repetitions and prolixities as ranging\namong the national bulwarks. It happens that the fire is hot where my\nLady sits and that the hand-screen is more beautiful than useful,\nbeing priceless but small. My Lady, changing her position, sees the\npapers on the table--looks at them nearer--looks at them nearer\nstill--asks impulsively, \"Who copied that?\"\n\nMr. Tulkinghorn stops short, surprised by my Lady's animation and her\nunusual tone.\n\n\"Is it what you people call law-hand?\" she asks, looking full at him\nin her careless way again and toying with her screen.\n\n\"Not quite. Probably\"--Mr. Tulkinghorn examines it as he speaks--\"the\nlegal character which it has was acquired after the original hand was\nformed. Why do you ask?\"\n\n\"Anything to vary this detestable monotony. Oh, go on, do!\"\n\nMr. Tulkinghorn reads again. The heat is greater; my Lady screens her\nface. Sir Leicester dozes, starts up suddenly, and cries, \"Eh? What\ndo you say?\"\n\n\"I say I am afraid,\" says Mr. Tulkinghorn, who had risen hastily,\n\"that Lady Dedlock is ill.\"\n\n\"Faint,\" my Lady murmurs with white lips, \"only that; but it is like\nthe faintness of death. Don't speak to me. Ring, and take me to my\nroom!\"\n\nMr. Tulkinghorn retires into another chamber; bells ring, feet\nshuffle and patter, silence ensues. Mercury at last begs Mr.\nTulkinghorn to return.\n\n\"Better now,\" quoth Sir Leicester, motioning the lawyer to sit down\nand read to him alone. \"I have been quite alarmed. I never knew my\nLady swoon before. But the weather is extremely trying, and she\nreally has been bored to death down at our place in Lincolnshire.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III\n\nA Progress\n\n\nI have a great deal of difficulty in beginning to write my portion of\nthese pages, for I know I am not clever. I always knew that. I can\nremember, when I was a very little girl indeed, I used to say to my\ndoll when we were alone together, \"Now, Dolly, I am not clever, you\nknow very well, and you must be patient with me, like a dear!\" And so\nshe used to sit propped up in a great arm-chair, with her beautiful\ncomplexion and rosy lips, staring at me--or not so much at me, I\nthink, as at nothing--while I busily stitched away and told her every\none of my secrets.\n\nMy dear old doll! I was such a shy little thing that I seldom dared\nto open my lips, and never dared to open my heart, to anybody else.\nIt almost makes me cry to think what a relief it used to be to me\nwhen I came home from school of a day to run upstairs to my room and\nsay, \"Oh, you dear faithful Dolly, I knew you would be expecting me!\"\nand then to sit down on the floor, leaning on the elbow of her great\nchair, and tell her all I had noticed since we parted. I had always\nrather a noticing way--not a quick way, oh, no!--a silent way of\nnoticing what passed before me and thinking I should like to\nunderstand it better. I have not by any means a quick understanding.\nWhen I love a person very tenderly indeed, it seems to brighten. But\neven that may be my vanity.\n\nI was brought up, from my earliest remembrance--like some of the\nprincesses in the fairy stories, only I was not charming--by my\ngodmother. At least, I only knew her as such. She was a good, good\nwoman! She went to church three times every Sunday, and to morning\nprayers on Wednesdays and Fridays, and to lectures whenever there\nwere lectures; and never missed. She was handsome; and if she had\never smiled, would have been (I used to think) like an angel--but she\nnever smiled. She was always grave and strict. She was so very good\nherself, I thought, that the badness of other people made her frown\nall her life. I felt so different from her, even making every\nallowance for the differences between a child and a woman; I felt so\npoor, so trifling, and so far off that I never could be unrestrained\nwith her--no, could never even love her as I wished. It made me very\nsorry to consider how good she was and how unworthy of her I was, and\nI used ardently to hope that I might have a better heart; and I\ntalked it over very often with the dear old doll, but I never loved\nmy godmother as I ought to have loved her and as I felt I must have\nloved her if I had been a better girl.\n\nThis made me, I dare say, more timid and retiring than I naturally\nwas and cast me upon Dolly as the only friend with whom I felt at\nease. But something happened when I was still quite a little thing\nthat helped it very much.\n\nI had never heard my mama spoken of. I had never heard of my papa\neither, but I felt more interested about my mama. I had never worn a\nblack frock, that I could recollect. I had never been shown my mama's\ngrave. I had never been told where it was. Yet I had never been\ntaught to pray for any relation but my godmother. I had more than\nonce approached this subject of my thoughts with Mrs. Rachael, our\nonly servant, who took my light away when I was in bed (another very\ngood woman, but austere to me), and she had only said, \"Esther, good\nnight!\" and gone away and left me.\n\nAlthough there were seven girls at the neighbouring school where I\nwas a day boarder, and although they called me little Esther\nSummerson, I knew none of them at home. All of them were older than\nI, to be sure (I was the youngest there by a good deal), but there\nseemed to be some other separation between us besides that, and\nbesides their being far more clever than I was and knowing much more\nthan I did. One of them in the first week of my going to the school\n(I remember it very well) invited me home to a little party, to my\ngreat joy. But my godmother wrote a stiff letter declining for me,\nand I never went. I never went out at all.\n\nIt was my birthday. There were holidays at school on other\nbirthdays--none on mine. There were rejoicings at home on other\nbirthdays, as I knew from what I heard the girls relate to one\nanother--there were none on mine. My birthday was the most melancholy\nday at home in the whole year.\n\nI have mentioned that unless my vanity should deceive me (as I know\nit may, for I may be very vain without suspecting it, though indeed I\ndon't), my comprehension is quickened when my affection is. My\ndisposition is very affectionate, and perhaps I might still feel such\na wound if such a wound could be received more than once with the\nquickness of that birthday.\n\nDinner was over, and my godmother and I were sitting at the table\nbefore the fire. The clock ticked, the fire clicked; not another\nsound had been heard in the room or in the house for I don't know how\nlong. I happened to look timidly up from my stitching, across the\ntable at my godmother, and I saw in her face, looking gloomily at me,\n\"It would have been far better, little Esther, that you had had no\nbirthday, that you had never been born!\"\n\nI broke out crying and sobbing, and I said, \"Oh, dear godmother, tell\nme, pray do tell me, did Mama die on my birthday?\"\n\n\"No,\" she returned. \"Ask me no more, child!\"\n\n\"Oh, do pray tell me something of her. Do now, at last, dear\ngodmother, if you please! What did I do to her? How did I lose her?\nWhy am I so different from other children, and why is it my fault,\ndear godmother? No, no, no, don't go away. Oh, speak to me!\"\n\nI was in a kind of fright beyond my grief, and I caught hold of her\ndress and was kneeling to her. She had been saying all the while,\n\"Let me go!\" But now she stood still.\n\nHer darkened face had such power over me that it stopped me in the\nmidst of my vehemence. I put up my trembling little hand to clasp\nhers or to beg her pardon with what earnestness I might, but withdrew\nit as she looked at me, and laid it on my fluttering heart. She\nraised me, sat in her chair, and standing me before her, said slowly\nin a cold, low voice--I see her knitted brow and pointed\nfinger--\"Your mother, Esther, is your disgrace, and you were hers.\nThe time will come--and soon enough--when you will understand this\nbetter and will feel it too, as no one save a woman can. I have\nforgiven her\"--but her face did not relent--\"the wrong she did to me,\nand I say no more of it, though it was greater than you will ever\nknow--than any one will ever know but I, the sufferer. For yourself,\nunfortunate girl, orphaned and degraded from the first of these evil\nanniversaries, pray daily that the sins of others be not visited upon\nyour head, according to what is written. Forget your mother and leave\nall other people to forget her who will do her unhappy child that\ngreatest kindness. Now, go!\"\n\nShe checked me, however, as I was about to depart from her--so frozen\nas I was!--and added this, \"Submission, self-denial, diligent work,\nare the preparations for a life begun with such a shadow on it. You\nare different from other children, Esther, because you were not born,\nlike them, in common sinfulness and wrath. You are set apart.\"\n\nI went up to my room, and crept to bed, and laid my doll's cheek\nagainst mine wet with tears, and holding that solitary friend upon my\nbosom, cried myself to sleep. Imperfect as my understanding of my\nsorrow was, I knew that I had brought no joy at any time to anybody's\nheart and that I was to no one upon earth what Dolly was to me.\n\nDear, dear, to think how much time we passed alone together\nafterwards, and how often I repeated to the doll the story of my\nbirthday and confided to her that I would try as hard as ever I could\nto repair the fault I had been born with (of which I confessedly felt\nguilty and yet innocent) and would strive as I grew up to be\nindustrious, contented, and kind-hearted and to do some good to some\none, and win some love to myself if I could. I hope it is not\nself-indulgent to shed these tears as I think of it. I am very\nthankful, I am very cheerful, but I cannot quite help their coming to\nmy eyes.\n\nThere! I have wiped them away now and can go on again properly.\n\nI felt the distance between my godmother and myself so much more\nafter the birthday, and felt so sensible of filling a place in her\nhouse which ought to have been empty, that I found her more difficult\nof approach, though I was fervently grateful to her in my heart, than\never. I felt in the same way towards my school companions; I felt in\nthe same way towards Mrs. Rachael, who was a widow; and oh, towards\nher daughter, of whom she was proud, who came to see her once a\nfortnight! I was very retired and quiet, and tried to be very\ndiligent.\n\nOne sunny afternoon when I had come home from school with my books\nand portfolio, watching my long shadow at my side, and as I was\ngliding upstairs to my room as usual, my godmother looked out of the\nparlour-door and called me back. Sitting with her, I found--which was\nvery unusual indeed--a stranger. A portly, important-looking\ngentleman, dressed all in black, with a white cravat, large gold\nwatch seals, a pair of gold eye-glasses, and a large seal-ring upon\nhis little finger.\n\n\"This,\" said my godmother in an undertone, \"is the child.\" Then she\nsaid in her naturally stern way of speaking, \"This is Esther, sir.\"\n\nThe gentleman put up his eye-glasses to look at me and said, \"Come\nhere, my dear!\" He shook hands with me and asked me to take off my\nbonnet, looking at me all the while. When I had complied, he said,\n\"Ah!\" and afterwards \"Yes!\" And then, taking off his eye-glasses and\nfolding them in a red case, and leaning back in his arm-chair,\nturning the case about in his two hands, he gave my godmother a nod.\nUpon that, my godmother said, \"You may go upstairs, Esther!\" And I\nmade him my curtsy and left him.\n\nIt must have been two years afterwards, and I was almost fourteen,\nwhen one dreadful night my godmother and I sat at the fireside. I was\nreading aloud, and she was listening. I had come down at nine o'clock\nas I always did to read the Bible to her, and was reading from St.\nJohn how our Saviour stooped down, writing with his finger in the\ndust, when they brought the sinful woman to him.\n\n\"So when they continued asking him, he lifted up himself and said\nunto them, 'He that is without sin among you, let him first cast a\nstone at her!'\"\n\nI was stopped by my godmother's rising, putting her hand to her head,\nand crying out in an awful voice from quite another part of the book,\n\"'Watch ye, therefore, lest coming suddenly he find you sleeping. And\nwhat I say unto you, I say unto all, Watch!'\"\n\nIn an instant, while she stood before me repeating these words, she\nfell down on the floor. I had no need to cry out; her voice had\nsounded through the house and been heard in the street.\n\nShe was laid upon her bed. For more than a week she lay there, little\naltered outwardly, with her old handsome resolute frown that I so\nwell knew carved upon her face. Many and many a time, in the day and\nin the night, with my head upon the pillow by her that my whispers\nmight be plainer to her, I kissed her, thanked her, prayed for her,\nasked her for her blessing and forgiveness, entreated her to give me\nthe least sign that she knew or heard me. No, no, no. Her face was\nimmovable. To the very last, and even afterwards, her frown remained\nunsoftened.\n\nOn the day after my poor good godmother was buried, the gentleman in\nblack with the white neckcloth reappeared. I was sent for by Mrs.\nRachael, and found him in the same place, as if he had never gone\naway.\n\n\"My name is Kenge,\" he said; \"you may remember it, my child; Kenge\nand Carboy, Lincoln's Inn.\"\n\nI replied that I remembered to have seen him once before.\n\n\"Pray be seated--here near me. Don't distress yourself; it's of no\nuse. Mrs. Rachael, I needn't inform you who were acquainted with the\nlate Miss Barbary's affairs, that her means die with her and that\nthis young lady, now her aunt is dead--\"\n\n\"My aunt, sir!\"\n\n\"It is really of no use carrying on a deception when no object is to\nbe gained by it,\" said Mr. Kenge smoothly, \"Aunt in fact, though not\nin law. Don't distress yourself! Don't weep! Don't tremble! Mrs.\nRachael, our young friend has no doubt heard of--the--a--Jarndyce and\nJarndyce.\"\n\n\"Never,\" said Mrs. Rachael.\n\n\"Is it possible,\" pursued Mr. Kenge, putting up his eye-glasses,\n\"that our young friend--I BEG you won't distress yourself!--never\nheard of Jarndyce and Jarndyce!\"\n\nI shook my head, wondering even what it was.\n\n\"Not of Jarndyce and Jarndyce?\" said Mr. Kenge, looking over his\nglasses at me and softly turning the case about and about as if he\nwere petting something. \"Not of one of the greatest Chancery suits\nknown? Not of Jarndyce and Jarndyce--the--a--in itself a monument of\nChancery practice. In which (I would say) every difficulty, every\ncontingency, every masterly fiction, every form of procedure known\nin that court, is represented over and over again? It is a cause\nthat could not exist out of this free and great country. I should\nsay that the aggregate of costs in Jarndyce and Jarndyce, Mrs.\nRachael\"--I was afraid he addressed himself to her because I appeared\ninattentive\"--amounts at the present hour to from SIX-ty to SEVEN-ty\nTHOUSAND POUNDS!\" said Mr. Kenge, leaning back in his chair.\n\nI felt very ignorant, but what could I do? I was so entirely\nunacquainted with the subject that I understood nothing about it even\nthen.\n\n\"And she really never heard of the cause!\" said Mr. Kenge.\n\"Surprising!\"\n\n\"Miss Barbary, sir,\" returned Mrs. Rachael, \"who is now among the\nSeraphim--\"\n\n\"I hope so, I am sure,\" said Mr. Kenge politely.\n\n\"--Wished Esther only to know what would be serviceable to her. And\nshe knows, from any teaching she has had here, nothing more.\"\n\n\"Well!\" said Mr. Kenge. \"Upon the whole, very proper. Now to the\npoint,\" addressing me. \"Miss Barbary, your sole relation (in fact\nthat is, for I am bound to observe that in law you had none) being\ndeceased and it naturally not being to be expected that Mrs.\nRachael--\"\n\n\"Oh, dear no!\" said Mrs. Rachael quickly.\n\n\"Quite so,\" assented Mr. Kenge; \"--that Mrs. Rachael should charge\nherself with your maintenance and support (I beg you won't distress\nyourself), you are in a position to receive the renewal of an offer\nwhich I was instructed to make to Miss Barbary some two years ago and\nwhich, though rejected then, was understood to be renewable under the\nlamentable circumstances that have since occurred. Now, if I avow\nthat I represent, in Jarndyce and Jarndyce and otherwise, a highly\nhumane, but at the same time singular, man, shall I compromise myself\nby any stretch of my professional caution?\" said Mr. Kenge, leaning\nback in his chair again and looking calmly at us both.\n\nHe appeared to enjoy beyond everything the sound of his own voice. I\ncouldn't wonder at that, for it was mellow and full and gave great\nimportance to every word he uttered. He listened to himself with\nobvious satisfaction and sometimes gently beat time to his own music\nwith his head or rounded a sentence with his hand. I was very much\nimpressed by him--even then, before I knew that he formed himself on\nthe model of a great lord who was his client and that he was\ngenerally called Conversation Kenge.\n\n\"Mr. Jarndyce,\" he pursued, \"being aware of the--I would say,\ndesolate--position of our young friend, offers to place her at a\nfirst-rate establishment where her education shall be completed,\nwhere her comfort shall be secured, where her reasonable wants shall\nbe anticipated, where she shall be eminently qualified to discharge\nher duty in that station of life unto which it has pleased--shall I\nsay Providence?--to call her.\"\n\nMy heart was filled so full, both by what he said and by his\naffecting manner of saying it, that I was not able to speak, though I\ntried.\n\n\"Mr. Jarndyce,\" he went on, \"makes no condition beyond expressing his\nexpectation that our young friend will not at any time remove herself\nfrom the establishment in question without his knowledge and\nconcurrence. That she will faithfully apply herself to the\nacquisition of those accomplishments, upon the exercise of which she\nwill be ultimately dependent. That she will tread in the paths of\nvirtue and honour, and--the--a--so forth.\"\n\nI was still less able to speak than before.\n\n\"Now, what does our young friend say?\" proceeded Mr. Kenge. \"Take\ntime, take time! I pause for her reply. But take time!\"\n\nWhat the destitute subject of such an offer tried to say, I need not\nrepeat. What she did say, I could more easily tell, if it were worth\nthe telling. What she felt, and will feel to her dying hour, I could\nnever relate.\n\nThis interview took place at Windsor, where I had passed (as far as I\nknew) my whole life. On that day week, amply provided with all\nnecessaries, I left it, inside the stagecoach, for Reading.\n\nMrs. Rachael was too good to feel any emotion at parting, but I was\nnot so good, and wept bitterly. I thought that I ought to have known\nher better after so many years and ought to have made myself enough\nof a favourite with her to make her sorry then. When she gave me one\ncold parting kiss upon my forehead, like a thaw-drop from the stone\nporch--it was a very frosty day--I felt so miserable and\nself-reproachful that I clung to her and told her it was my fault, I\nknew, that she could say good-bye so easily!\n\n\"No, Esther!\" she returned. \"It is your misfortune!\"\n\nThe coach was at the little lawn-gate--we had not come out until we\nheard the wheels--and thus I left her, with a sorrowful heart. She\nwent in before my boxes were lifted to the coach-roof and shut the\ndoor. As long as I could see the house, I looked back at it from the\nwindow through my tears. My godmother had left Mrs. Rachael all the\nlittle property she possessed; and there was to be a sale; and an old\nhearth-rug with roses on it, which always seemed to me the first\nthing in the world I had ever seen, was hanging outside in the frost\nand snow. A day or two before, I had wrapped the dear old doll in her\nown shawl and quietly laid her--I am half ashamed to tell it--in the\ngarden-earth under the tree that shaded my old window. I had no\ncompanion left but my bird, and him I carried with me in his cage.\n\nWhen the house was out of sight, I sat, with my bird-cage in the\nstraw at my feet, forward on the low seat to look out of the high\nwindow, watching the frosty trees, that were like beautiful pieces of\nspar, and the fields all smooth and white with last night's snow, and\nthe sun, so red but yielding so little heat, and the ice, dark like\nmetal where the skaters and sliders had brushed the snow away. There\nwas a gentleman in the coach who sat on the opposite seat and looked\nvery large in a quantity of wrappings, but he sat gazing out of the\nother window and took no notice of me.\n\nI thought of my dead godmother, of the night when I read to her, of\nher frowning so fixedly and sternly in her bed, of the strange place\nI was going to, of the people I should find there, and what they\nwould be like, and what they would say to me, when a voice in the\ncoach gave me a terrible start.\n\nIt said, \"What the de-vil are you crying for?\"\n\nI was so frightened that I lost my voice and could only answer in a\nwhisper, \"Me, sir?\" For of course I knew it must have been the\ngentleman in the quantity of wrappings, though he was still looking\nout of his window.\n\n\"Yes, you,\" he said, turning round.\n\n\"I didn't know I was crying, sir,\" I faltered.\n\n\"But you are!\" said the gentleman. \"Look here!\" He came quite\nopposite to me from the other corner of the coach, brushed one of his\nlarge furry cuffs across my eyes (but without hurting me), and showed\nme that it was wet.\n\n\"There! Now you know you are,\" he said. \"Don't you?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" I said.\n\n\"And what are you crying for?\" said the gentleman, \"Don't you want to\ngo there?\"\n\n\"Where, sir?\"\n\n\"Where? Why, wherever you are going,\" said the gentleman.\n\n\"I am very glad to go there, sir,\" I answered.\n\n\"Well, then! Look glad!\" said the gentleman.\n\nI thought he was very strange, or at least that what I could see of\nhim was very strange, for he was wrapped up to the chin, and his face\nwas almost hidden in a fur cap with broad fur straps at the side of\nhis head fastened under his chin; but I was composed again, and not\nafraid of him. So I told him that I thought I must have been crying\nbecause of my godmother's death and because of Mrs. Rachael's not\nbeing sorry to part with me.\n\n\"Confound Mrs. Rachael!\" said the gentleman. \"Let her fly away in a\nhigh wind on a broomstick!\"\n\nI began to be really afraid of him now and looked at him with the\ngreatest astonishment. But I thought that he had pleasant eyes,\nalthough he kept on muttering to himself in an angry manner and\ncalling Mrs. Rachael names.\n\nAfter a little while he opened his outer wrapper, which appeared to\nme large enough to wrap up the whole coach, and put his arm down into\na deep pocket in the side.\n\n\"Now, look here!\" he said. \"In this paper,\" which was nicely folded,\n\"is a piece of the best plum-cake that can be got for money--sugar on\nthe outside an inch thick, like fat on mutton chops. Here's a little\npie (a gem this is, both for size and quality), made in France. And\nwhat do you suppose it's made of? Livers of fat geese. There's a pie!\nNow let's see you eat 'em.\"\n\n\"Thank you, sir,\" I replied; \"thank you very much indeed, but I hope\nyou won't be offended--they are too rich for me.\"\n\n\"Floored again!\" said the gentleman, which I didn't at all\nunderstand, and threw them both out of window.\n\nHe did not speak to me any more until he got out of the coach a\nlittle way short of Reading, when he advised me to be a good girl and\nto be studious, and shook hands with me. I must say I was relieved by\nhis departure. We left him at a milestone. I often walked past it\nafterwards, and never for a long time without thinking of him and\nhalf expecting to meet him. But I never did; and so, as time went on,\nhe passed out of my mind.\n\nWhen the coach stopped, a very neat lady looked up at the window and\nsaid, \"Miss Donny.\"\n\n\"No, ma'am, Esther Summerson.\"\n\n\"That is quite right,\" said the lady, \"Miss Donny.\"\n\nI now understood that she introduced herself by that name, and begged\nMiss Donny's pardon for my mistake, and pointed out my boxes at her\nrequest. Under the direction of a very neat maid, they were put\noutside a very small green carriage; and then Miss Donny, the maid,\nand I got inside and were driven away.\n\n\"Everything is ready for you, Esther,\" said Miss Donny, \"and the\nscheme of your pursuits has been arranged in exact accordance with\nthe wishes of your guardian, Mr. Jarndyce.\"\n\n\"Of--did you say, ma'am?\"\n\n\"Of your guardian, Mr. Jarndyce,\" said Miss Donny.\n\nI was so bewildered that Miss Donny thought the cold had been too\nsevere for me and lent me her smelling-bottle.\n\n\"Do you know my--guardian, Mr. Jarndyce, ma'am?\" I asked after a good\ndeal of hesitation.\n\n\"Not personally, Esther,\" said Miss Donny; \"merely through his\nsolicitors, Messrs. Kenge and Carboy, of London. A very superior\ngentleman, Mr. Kenge. Truly eloquent indeed. Some of his periods\nquite majestic!\"\n\nI felt this to be very true but was too confused to attend to it. Our\nspeedy arrival at our destination, before I had time to recover\nmyself, increased my confusion, and I never shall forget the\nuncertain and the unreal air of everything at Greenleaf (Miss Donny's\nhouse) that afternoon!\n\nBut I soon became used to it. I was so adapted to the routine of\nGreenleaf before long that I seemed to have been there a great while\nand almost to have dreamed rather than really lived my old life at my\ngodmother's. Nothing could be more precise, exact, and orderly than\nGreenleaf. There was a time for everything all round the dial of the\nclock, and everything was done at its appointed moment.\n\nWe were twelve boarders, and there were two Miss Donnys, twins. It\nwas understood that I would have to depend, by and by, on my\nqualifications as a governess, and I was not only instructed in\neverything that was taught at Greenleaf, but was very soon engaged in\nhelping to instruct others. Although I was treated in every other\nrespect like the rest of the school, this single difference was made\nin my case from the first. As I began to know more, I taught more,\nand so in course of time I had plenty to do, which I was very fond of\ndoing because it made the dear girls fond of me. At last, whenever a\nnew pupil came who was a little downcast and unhappy, she was so\nsure--indeed I don't know why--to make a friend of me that all\nnew-comers were confided to my care. They said I was so gentle, but I\nam sure THEY were! I often thought of the resolution I had made on my\nbirthday to try to be industrious, contented, and true-hearted and to\ndo some good to some one and win some love if I could; and indeed,\nindeed, I felt almost ashamed to have done so little and have won so\nmuch.\n\nI passed at Greenleaf six happy, quiet years. I never saw in any face\nthere, thank heaven, on my birthday, that it would have been better\nif I had never been born. When the day came round, it brought me so\nmany tokens of affectionate remembrance that my room was beautiful\nwith them from New Year's Day to Christmas.\n\nIn those six years I had never been away except on visits at holiday\ntime in the neighbourhood. After the first six months or so I had\ntaken Miss Donny's advice in reference to the propriety of writing to\nMr. Kenge to say that I was happy and grateful, and with her approval\nI had written such a letter. I had received a formal answer\nacknowledging its receipt and saying, \"We note the contents thereof,\nwhich shall be duly communicated to our client.\" After that I\nsometimes heard Miss Donny and her sister mention how regular my\naccounts were paid, and about twice a year I ventured to write a\nsimilar letter. I always received by return of post exactly the same\nanswer in the same round hand, with the signature of Kenge and Carboy\nin another writing, which I supposed to be Mr. Kenge's.\n\nIt seems so curious to me to be obliged to write all this about\nmyself! As if this narrative were the narrative of MY life! But my\nlittle body will soon fall into the background now.\n\nSix quiet years (I find I am saying it for the second time) I had\npassed at Greenleaf, seeing in those around me, as it might be in a\nlooking-glass, every stage of my own growth and change there, when,\none November morning, I received this letter. I omit the date.\n\n\n   Old Square, Lincoln's Inn\n\n   Madam,\n\n   Jarndyce and Jarndyce\n\n   Our clt Mr. Jarndyce being abt to rece into his house,\n   under an Order of the Ct of Chy, a Ward of the Ct in this\n   cause, for whom he wishes to secure an elgble compn,\n   directs us to inform you that he will be glad of your\n   serces in the afsd capacity.\n\n   We have arrngd for your being forded, carriage free, pr\n   eight o'clock coach from Reading, on Monday morning next,\n   to White Horse Cellar, Piccadilly, London, where one of\n   our clks will be in waiting to convey you to our offe as\n   above.\n\n   We are, Madam, Your obedt Servts,\n\n   Kenge and Carboy\n\n   Miss Esther Summerson\n\n\nOh, never, never, never shall I forget the emotion this letter caused\nin the house! It was so tender in them to care so much for me, it was\nso gracious in that father who had not forgotten me to have made my\norphan way so smooth and easy and to have inclined so many youthful\nnatures towards me, that I could hardly bear it. Not that I would\nhave had them less sorry--I am afraid not; but the pleasure of it,\nand the pain of it, and the pride and joy of it, and the humble\nregret of it were so blended that my heart seemed almost breaking\nwhile it was full of rapture.\n\nThe letter gave me only five days' notice of my removal. When every\nminute added to the proofs of love and kindness that were given me in\nthose five days, and when at last the morning came and when they took\nme through all the rooms that I might see them for the last time, and\nwhen some cried, \"Esther, dear, say good-bye to me here at my\nbedside, where you first spoke so kindly to me!\" and when others\nasked me only to write their names, \"With Esther's love,\" and when\nthey all surrounded me with their parting presents and clung to me\nweeping and cried, \"What shall we do when dear, dear Esther's gone!\"\nand when I tried to tell them how forbearing and how good they had\nall been to me and how I blessed and thanked them every one, what a\nheart I had!\n\nAnd when the two Miss Donnys grieved as much to part with me as the\nleast among them, and when the maids said, \"Bless you, miss, wherever\nyou go!\" and when the ugly lame old gardener, who I thought had\nhardly noticed me in all those years, came panting after the coach to\ngive me a little nosegay of geraniums and told me I had been the\nlight of his eyes--indeed the old man said so!--what a heart I had\nthen!\n\nAnd could I help it if with all this, and the coming to the little\nschool, and the unexpected sight of the poor children outside waving\ntheir hats and bonnets to me, and of a grey-haired gentleman and lady\nwhose daughter I had helped to teach and at whose house I had visited\n(who were said to be the proudest people in all that country), caring\nfor nothing but calling out, \"Good-bye, Esther. May you be very\nhappy!\"--could I help it if I was quite bowed down in the coach by\nmyself and said \"Oh, I am so thankful, I am so thankful!\" many times\nover!\n\nBut of course I soon considered that I must not take tears where I\nwas going after all that had been done for me. Therefore, of course,\nI made myself sob less and persuaded myself to be quiet by saying\nvery often, \"Esther, now you really must! This WILL NOT do!\" I\ncheered myself up pretty well at last, though I am afraid I was\nlonger about it than I ought to have been; and when I had cooled my\neyes with lavender water, it was time to watch for London.\n\nI was quite persuaded that we were there when we were ten miles off,\nand when we really were there, that we should never get there.\nHowever, when we began to jolt upon a stone pavement, and\nparticularly when every other conveyance seemed to be running into\nus, and we seemed to be running into every other conveyance, I began\nto believe that we really were approaching the end of our journey.\nVery soon afterwards we stopped.\n\nA young gentleman who had inked himself by accident addressed me from\nthe pavement and said, \"I am from Kenge and Carboy's, miss, of\nLincoln's Inn.\"\n\n\"If you please, sir,\" said I.\n\nHe was very obliging, and as he handed me into a fly after\nsuperintending the removal of my boxes, I asked him whether there was\na great fire anywhere? For the streets were so full of dense brown\nsmoke that scarcely anything was to be seen.\n\n\"Oh, dear no, miss,\" he said. \"This is a London particular.\"\n\nI had never heard of such a thing.\n\n\"A fog, miss,\" said the young gentleman.\n\n\"Oh, indeed!\" said I.\n\nWe drove slowly through the dirtiest and darkest streets that ever\nwere seen in the world (I thought) and in such a distracting state of\nconfusion that I wondered how the people kept their senses, until we\npassed into sudden quietude under an old gateway and drove on through\na silent square until we came to an odd nook in a corner, where there\nwas an entrance up a steep, broad flight of stairs, like an entrance\nto a church. And there really was a churchyard outside under some\ncloisters, for I saw the gravestones from the staircase window.\n\nThis was Kenge and Carboy's. The young gentleman showed me through an\nouter office into Mr. Kenge's room--there was no one in it--and\npolitely put an arm-chair for me by the fire. He then called my\nattention to a little looking-glass hanging from a nail on one side\nof the chimney-piece.\n\n\"In case you should wish to look at yourself, miss, after the\njourney, as you're going before the Chancellor. Not that it's\nrequisite, I am sure,\" said the young gentleman civilly.\n\n\"Going before the Chancellor?\" I said, startled for a moment.\n\n\"Only a matter of form, miss,\" returned the young gentleman. \"Mr.\nKenge is in court now. He left his compliments, and would you partake\nof some refreshment\"--there were biscuits and a decanter of wine on a\nsmall table--\"and look over the paper,\" which the young gentleman\ngave me as he spoke. He then stirred the fire and left me.\n\nEverything was so strange--the stranger from its being night in the\nday-time, the candles burning with a white flame, and looking raw and\ncold--that I read the words in the newspaper without knowing what\nthey meant and found myself reading the same words repeatedly. As it\nwas of no use going on in that way, I put the paper down, took a peep\nat my bonnet in the glass to see if it was neat, and looked at the\nroom, which was not half lighted, and at the shabby, dusty tables,\nand at the piles of writings, and at a bookcase full of the most\ninexpressive-looking books that ever had anything to say for\nthemselves. Then I went on, thinking, thinking, thinking; and the\nfire went on, burning, burning, burning; and the candles went on\nflickering and guttering, and there were no snuffers--until the young\ngentleman by and by brought a very dirty pair--for two hours.\n\nAt last Mr. Kenge came. HE was not altered, but he was surprised to\nsee how altered I was and appeared quite pleased. \"As you are going\nto be the companion of the young lady who is now in the Chancellor's\nprivate room, Miss Summerson,\" he said, \"we thought it well that you\nshould be in attendance also. You will not be discomposed by the Lord\nChancellor, I dare say?\"\n\n\"No, sir,\" I said, \"I don't think I shall,\" really not seeing on\nconsideration why I should be.\n\nSo Mr. Kenge gave me his arm and we went round the corner, under a\ncolonnade, and in at a side door. And so we came, along a passage,\ninto a comfortable sort of room where a young lady and a young\ngentleman were standing near a great, loud-roaring fire. A screen was\ninterposed between them and it, and they were leaning on the screen,\ntalking.\n\nThey both looked up when I came in, and I saw in the young lady, with\nthe fire shining upon her, such a beautiful girl! With such rich\ngolden hair, such soft blue eyes, and such a bright, innocent,\ntrusting face!\n\n\"Miss Ada,\" said Mr. Kenge, \"this is Miss Summerson.\"\n\nShe came to meet me with a smile of welcome and her hand extended,\nbut seemed to change her mind in a moment and kissed me. In short,\nshe had such a natural, captivating, winning manner that in a few\nminutes we were sitting in the window-seat, with the light of the\nfire upon us, talking together as free and happy as could be.\n\nWhat a load off my mind! It was so delightful to know that she could\nconfide in me and like me! It was so good of her, and so encouraging\nto me!\n\nThe young gentleman was her distant cousin, she told me, and his name\nRichard Carstone. He was a handsome youth with an ingenuous face and\na most engaging laugh; and after she had called him up to where we\nsat, he stood by us, in the light of the fire, talking gaily, like a\nlight-hearted boy. He was very young, not more than nineteen then, if\nquite so much, but nearly two years older than she was. They were\nboth orphans and (what was very unexpected and curious to me) had\nnever met before that day. Our all three coming together for the\nfirst time in such an unusual place was a thing to talk about, and we\ntalked about it; and the fire, which had left off roaring, winked its\nred eyes at us--as Richard said--like a drowsy old Chancery lion.\n\nWe conversed in a low tone because a full-dressed gentleman in a bag\nwig frequently came in and out, and when he did so, we could hear a\ndrawling sound in the distance, which he said was one of the counsel\nin our case addressing the Lord Chancellor. He told Mr. Kenge that\nthe Chancellor would be up in five minutes; and presently we heard a\nbustle and a tread of feet, and Mr. Kenge said that the Court had\nrisen and his lordship was in the next room.\n\nThe gentleman in the bag wig opened the door almost directly and\nrequested Mr. Kenge to come in. Upon that, we all went into the next\nroom, Mr. Kenge first, with my darling--it is so natural to me now\nthat I can't help writing it; and there, plainly dressed in black and\nsitting in an arm-chair at a table near the fire, was his lordship,\nwhose robe, trimmed with beautiful gold lace, was thrown upon another\nchair. He gave us a searching look as we entered, but his manner was\nboth courtly and kind.\n\nThe gentleman in the bag wig laid bundles of papers on his lordship's\ntable, and his lordship silently selected one and turned over the\nleaves.\n\n\"Miss Clare,\" said the Lord Chancellor. \"Miss Ada Clare?\"\n\nMr. Kenge presented her, and his lordship begged her to sit down near\nhim. That he admired her and was interested by her even I could see\nin a moment. It touched me that the home of such a beautiful young\ncreature should be represented by that dry, official place. The Lord\nHigh Chancellor, at his best, appeared so poor a substitute for the\nlove and pride of parents.\n\n\"The Jarndyce in question,\" said the Lord Chancellor, still turning\nover leaves, \"is Jarndyce of Bleak House.\"\n\n\"Jarndyce of Bleak House, my lord,\" said Mr. Kenge.\n\n\"A dreary name,\" said the Lord Chancellor.\n\n\"But not a dreary place at present, my lord,\" said Mr. Kenge.\n\n\"And Bleak House,\" said his lordship, \"is in--\"\n\n\"Hertfordshire, my lord.\"\n\n\"Mr. Jarndyce of Bleak House is not married?\" said his lordship.\n\n\"He is not, my lord,\" said Mr. Kenge.\n\nA pause.\n\n\"Young Mr. Richard Carstone is present?\" said the Lord Chancellor,\nglancing towards him.\n\nRichard bowed and stepped forward.\n\n\"Hum!\" said the Lord Chancellor, turning over more leaves.\n\n\"Mr. Jarndyce of Bleak House, my lord,\" Mr. Kenge observed in a low\nvoice, \"if I may venture to remind your lordship, provides a suitable\ncompanion for--\"\n\n\"For Mr. Richard Carstone?\" I thought (but I am not quite sure) I\nheard his lordship say in an equally low voice and with a smile.\n\n\"For Miss Ada Clare. This is the young lady. Miss Summerson.\"\n\nHis lordship gave me an indulgent look and acknowledged my curtsy\nvery graciously.\n\n\"Miss Summerson is not related to any party in the cause, I think?\"\n\n\"No, my lord.\"\n\nMr. Kenge leant over before it was quite said and whispered. His\nlordship, with his eyes upon his papers, listened, nodded twice or\nthrice, turned over more leaves, and did not look towards me again\nuntil we were going away.\n\nMr. Kenge now retired, and Richard with him, to where I was, near the\ndoor, leaving my pet (it is so natural to me that again I can't help\nit!) sitting near the Lord Chancellor, with whom his lordship spoke a\nlittle part, asking her, as she told me afterwards, whether she had\nwell reflected on the proposed arrangement, and if she thought she\nwould be happy under the roof of Mr. Jarndyce of Bleak House, and why\nshe thought so? Presently he rose courteously and released her, and\nthen he spoke for a minute or two with Richard Carstone, not seated,\nbut standing, and altogether with more ease and less ceremony, as if\nhe still knew, though he WAS Lord Chancellor, how to go straight to\nthe candour of a boy.\n\n\"Very well!\" said his lordship aloud. \"I shall make the order. Mr.\nJarndyce of Bleak House has chosen, so far as I may judge,\" and this\nwas when he looked at me, \"a very good companion for the young lady,\nand the arrangement altogether seems the best of which the\ncircumstances admit.\"\n\nHe dismissed us pleasantly, and we all went out, very much obliged to\nhim for being so affable and polite, by which he had certainly lost\nno dignity but seemed to us to have gained some.\n\nWhen we got under the colonnade, Mr. Kenge remembered that he must go\nback for a moment to ask a question and left us in the fog, with the\nLord Chancellor's carriage and servants waiting for him to come out.\n\n\"Well!\" said Richard Carstone. \"THAT'S over! And where do we go next,\nMiss Summerson?\"\n\n\"Don't you know?\" I said.\n\n\"Not in the least,\" said he.\n\n\"And don't YOU know, my love?\" I asked Ada.\n\n\"No!\" said she. \"Don't you?\"\n\n\"Not at all!\" said I.\n\nWe looked at one another, half laughing at our being like the\nchildren in the wood, when a curious little old woman in a squeezed\nbonnet and carrying a reticule came curtsying and smiling up to us\nwith an air of great ceremony.\n\n\"Oh!\" said she. \"The wards in Jarndyce! Ve-ry happy, I am sure, to\nhave the honour! It is a good omen for youth, and hope, and beauty\nwhen they find themselves in this place, and don't know what's to\ncome of it.\"\n\n\"Mad!\" whispered Richard, not thinking she could hear him.\n\n\"Right! Mad, young gentleman,\" she returned so quickly that he was\nquite abashed. \"I was a ward myself. I was not mad at that time,\"\ncurtsying low and smiling between every little sentence. \"I had youth\nand hope. I believe, beauty. It matters very little now. Neither of\nthe three served or saved me. I have the honour to attend court\nregularly. With my documents. I expect a judgment. Shortly. On the\nDay of Judgment. I have discovered that the sixth seal mentioned in\nthe Revelations is the Great Seal. It has been open a long time! Pray\naccept my blessing.\"\n\nAs Ada was a little frightened, I said, to humour the poor old lady,\nthat we were much obliged to her.\n\n\"Ye-es!\" she said mincingly. \"I imagine so. And here is Conversation\nKenge. With HIS documents! How does your honourable worship do?\"\n\n\"Quite well, quite well! Now don't be troublesome, that's a good\nsoul!\" said Mr. Kenge, leading the way back.\n\n\"By no means,\" said the poor old lady, keeping up with Ada and me.\n\"Anything but troublesome. I shall confer estates on both--which is\nnot being troublesome, I trust? I expect a judgment. Shortly. On the\nDay of Judgment. This is a good omen for you. Accept my blessing!\"\n\nShe stopped at the bottom of the steep, broad flight of stairs; but\nwe looked back as we went up, and she was still there, saying, still\nwith a curtsy and a smile between every little sentence, \"Youth. And\nhope. And beauty. And Chancery. And Conversation Kenge! Ha! Pray\naccept my blessing!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV\n\nTelescopic Philanthropy\n\n\nWe were to pass the night, Mr. Kenge told us when we arrived in his\nroom, at Mrs. Jellyby's; and then he turned to me and said he took it\nfor granted I knew who Mrs. Jellyby was.\n\n\"I really don't, sir,\" I returned. \"Perhaps Mr. Carstone--or Miss\nClare--\"\n\nBut no, they knew nothing whatever about Mrs. Jellyby. \"In-deed! Mrs.\nJellyby,\" said Mr. Kenge, standing with his back to the fire and\ncasting his eyes over the dusty hearth-rug as if it were Mrs.\nJellyby's biography, \"is a lady of very remarkable strength of\ncharacter who devotes herself entirely to the public. She has devoted\nherself to an extensive variety of public subjects at various times\nand is at present (until something else attracts her) devoted to the\nsubject of Africa, with a view to the general cultivation of the\ncoffee berry--AND the natives--and the happy settlement, on the banks\nof the African rivers, of our superabundant home population. Mr.\nJarndyce, who is desirous to aid any work that is considered likely\nto be a good work and who is much sought after by philanthropists,\nhas, I believe, a very high opinion of Mrs. Jellyby.\"\n\nMr. Kenge, adjusting his cravat, then looked at us.\n\n\"And Mr. Jellyby, sir?\" suggested Richard.\n\n\"Ah! Mr. Jellyby,\" said Mr. Kenge, \"is--a--I don't know that I can\ndescribe him to you better than by saying that he is the husband of\nMrs. Jellyby.\"\n\n\"A nonentity, sir?\" said Richard with a droll look.\n\n\"I don't say that,\" returned Mr. Kenge gravely. \"I can't say that,\nindeed, for I know nothing whatever OF Mr. Jellyby. I never, to my\nknowledge, had the pleasure of seeing Mr. Jellyby. He may be a very\nsuperior man, but he is, so to speak, merged--merged--in the more\nshining qualities of his wife.\" Mr. Kenge proceeded to tell us that\nas the road to Bleak House would have been very long, dark, and\ntedious on such an evening, and as we had been travelling already,\nMr. Jarndyce had himself proposed this arrangement. A carriage would\nbe at Mrs. Jellyby's to convey us out of town early in the forenoon\nof to-morrow.\n\nHe then rang a little bell, and the young gentleman came in.\nAddressing him by the name of Guppy, Mr. Kenge inquired whether Miss\nSummerson's boxes and the rest of the baggage had been \"sent round.\"\nMr. Guppy said yes, they had been sent round, and a coach was waiting\nto take us round too as soon as we pleased.\n\n\"Then it only remains,\" said Mr. Kenge, shaking hands with us, \"for\nme to express my lively satisfaction in (good day, Miss Clare!) the\narrangement this day concluded and my (GOOD-bye to you, Miss\nSummerson!) lively hope that it will conduce to the happiness, the\n(glad to have had the honour of making your acquaintance, Mr.\nCarstone!) welfare, the advantage in all points of view, of all\nconcerned! Guppy, see the party safely there.\"\n\n\"Where IS 'there,' Mr. Guppy?\" said Richard as we went downstairs.\n\n\"No distance,\" said Mr. Guppy; \"round in Thavies Inn, you know.\"\n\n\"I can't say I know where it is, for I come from Winchester and am\nstrange in London.\"\n\n\"Only round the corner,\" said Mr. Guppy. \"We just twist up Chancery\nLane, and cut along Holborn, and there we are in four minutes' time,\nas near as a toucher. This is about a London particular NOW, ain't\nit, miss?\" He seemed quite delighted with it on my account.\n\n\"The fog is very dense indeed!\" said I.\n\n\"Not that it affects you, though, I'm sure,\" said Mr. Guppy, putting\nup the steps. \"On the contrary, it seems to do you good, miss,\njudging from your appearance.\"\n\nI knew he meant well in paying me this compliment, so I laughed at\nmyself for blushing at it when he had shut the door and got upon the\nbox; and we all three laughed and chatted about our inexperience and\nthe strangeness of London until we turned up under an archway to our\ndestination--a narrow street of high houses like an oblong cistern to\nhold the fog. There was a confused little crowd of people,\nprincipally children, gathered about the house at which we stopped,\nwhich had a tarnished brass plate on the door with the inscription\nJELLYBY.\n\n\"Don't be frightened!\" said Mr. Guppy, looking in at the\ncoach-window. \"One of the young Jellybys been and got his head\nthrough the area railings!\"\n\n\"Oh, poor child,\" said I; \"let me out, if you please!\"\n\n\"Pray be careful of yourself, miss. The young Jellybys are always up\nto something,\" said Mr. Guppy.\n\nI made my way to the poor child, who was one of the dirtiest little\nunfortunates I ever saw, and found him very hot and frightened and\ncrying loudly, fixed by the neck between two iron railings, while a\nmilkman and a beadle, with the kindest intentions possible, were\nendeavouring to drag him back by the legs, under a general impression\nthat his skull was compressible by those means. As I found (after\npacifying him) that he was a little boy with a naturally large head,\nI thought that perhaps where his head could go, his body could\nfollow, and mentioned that the best mode of extrication might be to\npush him forward. This was so favourably received by the milkman and\nbeadle that he would immediately have been pushed into the area if I\nhad not held his pinafore while Richard and Mr. Guppy ran down\nthrough the kitchen to catch him when he should be released. At last\nhe was happily got down without any accident, and then he began to\nbeat Mr. Guppy with a hoop-stick in quite a frantic manner.\n\nNobody had appeared belonging to the house except a person in\npattens, who had been poking at the child from below with a broom; I\ndon't know with what object, and I don't think she did. I therefore\nsupposed that Mrs. Jellyby was not at home, and was quite surprised\nwhen the person appeared in the passage without the pattens, and\ngoing up to the back room on the first floor before Ada and me,\nannounced us as, \"Them two young ladies, Missis Jellyby!\" We passed\nseveral more children on the way up, whom it was difficult to avoid\ntreading on in the dark; and as we came into Mrs. Jellyby's presence,\none of the poor little things fell downstairs--down a whole flight\n(as it sounded to me), with a great noise.\n\nMrs. Jellyby, whose face reflected none of the uneasiness which we\ncould not help showing in our own faces as the dear child's head\nrecorded its passage with a bump on every stair--Richard afterwards\nsaid he counted seven, besides one for the landing--received us with\nperfect equanimity. She was a pretty, very diminutive, plump woman of\nfrom forty to fifty, with handsome eyes, though they had a curious\nhabit of seeming to look a long way off. As if--I am quoting Richard\nagain--they could see nothing nearer than Africa!\n\n\"I am very glad indeed,\" said Mrs. Jellyby in an agreeable voice, \"to\nhave the pleasure of receiving you. I have a great respect for Mr.\nJarndyce, and no one in whom he is interested can be an object of\nindifference to me.\"\n\nWe expressed our acknowledgments and sat down behind the door, where\nthere was a lame invalid of a sofa. Mrs. Jellyby had very good hair\nbut was too much occupied with her African duties to brush it. The\nshawl in which she had been loosely muffled dropped onto her chair\nwhen she advanced to us; and as she turned to resume her seat, we\ncould not help noticing that her dress didn't nearly meet up the back\nand that the open space was railed across with a lattice-work of\nstay-lace--like a summer-house.\n\nThe room, which was strewn with papers and nearly filled by a great\nwriting-table covered with similar litter, was, I must say, not only\nvery untidy but very dirty. We were obliged to take notice of that\nwith our sense of sight, even while, with our sense of hearing, we\nfollowed the poor child who had tumbled downstairs: I think into the\nback kitchen, where somebody seemed to stifle him.\n\nBut what principally struck us was a jaded and unhealthy-looking\nthough by no means plain girl at the writing-table, who sat biting\nthe feather of her pen and staring at us. I suppose nobody ever was\nin such a state of ink. And from her tumbled hair to her pretty feet,\nwhich were disfigured with frayed and broken satin slippers trodden\ndown at heel, she really seemed to have no article of dress upon her,\nfrom a pin upwards, that was in its proper condition or its right\nplace.\n\n\"You find me, my dears,\" said Mrs. Jellyby, snuffing the two great\noffice candles in tin candlesticks, which made the room taste\nstrongly of hot tallow (the fire had gone out, and there was nothing\nin the grate but ashes, a bundle of wood, and a poker), \"you find me,\nmy dears, as usual, very busy; but that you will excuse. The African\nproject at present employs my whole time. It involves me in\ncorrespondence with public bodies and with private individuals\nanxious for the welfare of their species all over the country. I am\nhappy to say it is advancing. We hope by this time next year to have\nfrom a hundred and fifty to two hundred healthy families cultivating\ncoffee and educating the natives of Borrioboola-Gha, on the left bank\nof the Niger.\"\n\nAs Ada said nothing, but looked at me, I said it must be very\ngratifying.\n\n\"It IS gratifying,\" said Mrs. Jellyby. \"It involves the devotion of\nall my energies, such as they are; but that is nothing, so that it\nsucceeds; and I am more confident of success every day. Do you know,\nMiss Summerson, I almost wonder that YOU never turned your thoughts\nto Africa.\"\n\nThis application of the subject was really so unexpected to me that I\nwas quite at a loss how to receive it. I hinted that the climate--\n\n\"The finest climate in the world!\" said Mrs. Jellyby.\n\n\"Indeed, ma'am?\"\n\n\"Certainly. With precaution,\" said Mrs. Jellyby. \"You may go into\nHolborn, without precaution, and be run over. You may go into\nHolborn, with precaution, and never be run over. Just so with\nAfrica.\"\n\nI said, \"No doubt.\" I meant as to Holborn.\n\n\"If you would like,\" said Mrs. Jellyby, putting a number of papers\ntowards us, \"to look over some remarks on that head, and on the\ngeneral subject, which have been extensively circulated, while I\nfinish a letter I am now dictating to my eldest daughter, who is my\namanuensis--\"\n\nThe girl at the table left off biting her pen and made a return to\nour recognition, which was half bashful and half sulky.\n\n\"--I shall then have finished for the present,\" proceeded Mrs.\nJellyby with a sweet smile, \"though my work is never done. Where are\nyou, Caddy?\"\n\n\"'Presents her compliments to Mr. Swallow, and begs--'\" said Caddy.\n\n\"'And begs,'\" said Mrs. Jellyby, dictating, \"'to inform him, in\nreference to his letter of inquiry on the African project--' No,\nPeepy! Not on my account!\"\n\nPeepy (so self-named) was the unfortunate child who had fallen\ndownstairs, who now interrupted the correspondence by presenting\nhimself, with a strip of plaster on his forehead, to exhibit his\nwounded knees, in which Ada and I did not know which to pity\nmost--the bruises or the dirt. Mrs. Jellyby merely added, with the\nserene composure with which she said everything, \"Go along, you\nnaughty Peepy!\" and fixed her fine eyes on Africa again.\n\nHowever, as she at once proceeded with her dictation, and as I\ninterrupted nothing by doing it, I ventured quietly to stop poor\nPeepy as he was going out and to take him up to nurse. He looked very\nmuch astonished at it and at Ada's kissing him, but soon fell fast\nasleep in my arms, sobbing at longer and longer intervals, until he\nwas quiet. I was so occupied with Peepy that I lost the letter in\ndetail, though I derived such a general impression from it of the\nmomentous importance of Africa, and the utter insignificance of all\nother places and things, that I felt quite ashamed to have thought so\nlittle about it.\n\n\"Six o'clock!\" said Mrs. Jellyby. \"And our dinner hour is nominally\n(for we dine at all hours) five! Caddy, show Miss Clare and Miss\nSummerson their rooms. You will like to make some change, perhaps?\nYou will excuse me, I know, being so much occupied. Oh, that very bad\nchild! Pray put him down, Miss Summerson!\"\n\nI begged permission to retain him, truly saying that he was not at\nall troublesome, and carried him upstairs and laid him on my bed. Ada\nand I had two upper rooms with a door of communication between. They\nwere excessively bare and disorderly, and the curtain to my window\nwas fastened up with a fork.\n\n\"You would like some hot water, wouldn't you?\" said Miss Jellyby,\nlooking round for a jug with a handle to it, but looking in vain.\n\n\"If it is not being troublesome,\" said we.\n\n\"Oh, it's not the trouble,\" returned Miss Jellyby; \"the question is,\nif there IS any.\"\n\nThe evening was so very cold and the rooms had such a marshy smell\nthat I must confess it was a little miserable, and Ada was half\ncrying. We soon laughed, however, and were busily unpacking when Miss\nJellyby came back to say that she was sorry there was no hot water,\nbut they couldn't find the kettle, and the boiler was out of order.\n\nWe begged her not to mention it and made all the haste we could to\nget down to the fire again. But all the little children had come up\nto the landing outside to look at the phenomenon of Peepy lying on my\nbed, and our attention was distracted by the constant apparition of\nnoses and fingers in situations of danger between the hinges of the\ndoors. It was impossible to shut the door of either room, for my\nlock, with no knob to it, looked as if it wanted to be wound up; and\nthough the handle of Ada's went round and round with the greatest\nsmoothness, it was attended with no effect whatever on the door.\nTherefore I proposed to the children that they should come in and be\nvery good at my table, and I would tell them the story of Little Red\nRiding Hood while I dressed; which they did, and were as quiet as\nmice, including Peepy, who awoke opportunely before the appearance of\nthe wolf.\n\nWhen we went downstairs we found a mug with \"A Present from Tunbridge\nWells\" on it lighted up in the staircase window with a floating wick,\nand a young woman, with a swelled face bound up in a flannel bandage\nblowing the fire of the drawing-room (now connected by an open door\nwith Mrs. Jellyby's room) and choking dreadfully. It smoked to that\ndegree, in short, that we all sat coughing and crying with the\nwindows open for half an hour, during which Mrs. Jellyby, with the\nsame sweetness of temper, directed letters about Africa. Her being so\nemployed was, I must say, a great relief to me, for Richard told us\nthat he had washed his hands in a pie-dish and that they had found\nthe kettle on his dressing-table, and he made Ada laugh so that they\nmade me laugh in the most ridiculous manner.\n\nSoon after seven o'clock we went down to dinner, carefully, by Mrs.\nJellyby's advice, for the stair-carpets, besides being very deficient\nin stair-wires, were so torn as to be absolute traps. We had a fine\ncod-fish, a piece of roast beef, a dish of cutlets, and a pudding; an\nexcellent dinner, if it had had any cooking to speak of, but it was\nalmost raw. The young woman with the flannel bandage waited, and\ndropped everything on the table wherever it happened to go, and never\nmoved it again until she put it on the stairs. The person I had seen\nin pattens, who I suppose to have been the cook, frequently came and\nskirmished with her at the door, and there appeared to be ill will\nbetween them.\n\nAll through dinner--which was long, in consequence of such accidents\nas the dish of potatoes being mislaid in the coal skuttle and the\nhandle of the corkscrew coming off and striking the young woman in\nthe chin--Mrs. Jellyby preserved the evenness of her disposition. She\ntold us a great deal that was interesting about Borrioboola-Gha and\nthe natives, and received so many letters that Richard, who sat by\nher, saw four envelopes in the gravy at once. Some of the letters\nwere proceedings of ladies' committees or resolutions of ladies'\nmeetings, which she read to us; others were applications from people\nexcited in various ways about the cultivation of coffee, and natives;\nothers required answers, and these she sent her eldest daughter from\nthe table three or four times to write. She was full of business and\nundoubtedly was, as she had told us, devoted to the cause.\n\nI was a little curious to know who a mild bald gentleman in\nspectacles was, who dropped into a vacant chair (there was no top or\nbottom in particular) after the fish was taken away and seemed\npassively to submit himself to Borrioboola-Gha but not to be actively\ninterested in that settlement. As he never spoke a word, he might\nhave been a native but for his complexion. It was not until we left\nthe table and he remained alone with Richard that the possibility of\nhis being Mr. Jellyby ever entered my head. But he WAS Mr. Jellyby;\nand a loquacious young man called Mr. Quale, with large shining knobs\nfor temples and his hair all brushed to the back of his head, who\ncame in the evening, and told Ada he was a philanthropist, also\ninformed her that he called the matrimonial alliance of Mrs. Jellyby\nwith Mr. Jellyby the union of mind and matter.\n\nThis young man, besides having a great deal to say for himself about\nAfrica and a project of his for teaching the coffee colonists to\nteach the natives to turn piano-forte legs and establish an export\ntrade, delighted in drawing Mrs. Jellyby out by saying, \"I believe\nnow, Mrs. Jellyby, you have received as many as from one hundred and\nfifty to two hundred letters respecting Africa in a single day, have\nyou not?\" or, \"If my memory does not deceive me, Mrs. Jellyby, you\nonce mentioned that you had sent off five thousand circulars from one\npost-office at one time?\"--always repeating Mrs. Jellyby's answer to\nus like an interpreter. During the whole evening, Mr. Jellyby sat in\na corner with his head against the wall as if he were subject to low\nspirits. It seemed that he had several times opened his mouth when\nalone with Richard after dinner, as if he had something on his mind,\nbut had always shut it again, to Richard's extreme confusion, without\nsaying anything.\n\nMrs. Jellyby, sitting in quite a nest of waste paper, drank coffee\nall the evening and dictated at intervals to her eldest daughter. She\nalso held a discussion with Mr. Quale, of which the subject seemed to\nbe--if I understood it--the brotherhood of humanity, and gave\nutterance to some beautiful sentiments. I was not so attentive an\nauditor as I might have wished to be, however, for Peepy and the\nother children came flocking about Ada and me in a corner of the\ndrawing-room to ask for another story; so we sat down among them and\ntold them in whispers \"Puss in Boots\" and I don't know what else\nuntil Mrs. Jellyby, accidentally remembering them, sent them to bed.\nAs Peepy cried for me to take him to bed, I carried him upstairs,\nwhere the young woman with the flannel bandage charged into the midst\nof the little family like a dragon and overturned them into cribs.\n\nAfter that I occupied myself in making our room a little tidy and in\ncoaxing a very cross fire that had been lighted to burn, which at\nlast it did, quite brightly. On my return downstairs, I felt that\nMrs. Jellyby looked down upon me rather for being so frivolous, and I\nwas sorry for it, though at the same time I knew that I had no higher\npretensions.\n\nIt was nearly midnight before we found an opportunity of going to\nbed, and even then we left Mrs. Jellyby among her papers drinking\ncoffee and Miss Jellyby biting the feather of her pen.\n\n\"What a strange house!\" said Ada when we got upstairs. \"How curious\nof my cousin Jarndyce to send us here!\"\n\n\"My love,\" said I, \"it quite confuses me. I want to understand it,\nand I can't understand it at all.\"\n\n\"What?\" asked Ada with her pretty smile.\n\n\"All this, my dear,\" said I. \"It MUST be very good of Mrs. Jellyby to\ntake such pains about a scheme for the benefit of natives--and\nyet--Peepy and the housekeeping!\"\n\nAda laughed and put her arm about my neck as I stood looking at the\nfire, and told me I was a quiet, dear, good creature and had won her\nheart. \"You are so thoughtful, Esther,\" she said, \"and yet so\ncheerful! And you do so much, so unpretendingly! You would make a\nhome out of even this house.\"\n\nMy simple darling! She was quite unconscious that she only praised\nherself and that it was in the goodness of her own heart that she\nmade so much of me!\n\n\"May I ask you a question?\" said I when we had sat before the fire a\nlittle while.\n\n\"Five hundred,\" said Ada.\n\n\"Your cousin, Mr. Jarndyce. I owe so much to him. Would you mind\ndescribing him to me?\"\n\nShaking her golden hair, Ada turned her eyes upon me with such\nlaughing wonder that I was full of wonder too, partly at her beauty,\npartly at her surprise.\n\n\"Esther!\" she cried.\n\n\"My dear!\"\n\n\"You want a description of my cousin Jarndyce?\"\n\n\"My dear, I never saw him.\"\n\n\"And I never saw him!\" returned Ada.\n\nWell, to be sure!\n\nNo, she had never seen him. Young as she was when her mama died, she\nremembered how the tears would come into her eyes when she spoke of\nhim and of the noble generosity of his character, which she had said\nwas to be trusted above all earthly things; and Ada trusted it. Her\ncousin Jarndyce had written to her a few months ago--\"a plain, honest\nletter,\" Ada said--proposing the arrangement we were now to enter on\nand telling her that \"in time it might heal some of the wounds made\nby the miserable Chancery suit.\" She had replied, gratefully\naccepting his proposal. Richard had received a similar letter and had\nmade a similar response. He HAD seen Mr. Jarndyce once, but only\nonce, five years ago, at Winchester school. He had told Ada, when\nthey were leaning on the screen before the fire where I found them,\nthat he recollected him as \"a bluff, rosy fellow.\" This was the\nutmost description Ada could give me.\n\nIt set me thinking so that when Ada was asleep, I still remained\nbefore the fire, wondering and wondering about Bleak House, and\nwondering and wondering that yesterday morning should seem so long\nago. I don't know where my thoughts had wandered when they were\nrecalled by a tap at the door.\n\nI opened it softly and found Miss Jellyby shivering there with a\nbroken candle in a broken candlestick in one hand and an egg-cup in\nthe other.\n\n\"Good night!\" she said very sulkily.\n\n\"Good night!\" said I.\n\n\"May I come in?\" she shortly and unexpectedly asked me in the same\nsulky way.\n\n\"Certainly,\" said I. \"Don't wake Miss Clare.\"\n\nShe would not sit down, but stood by the fire dipping her inky middle\nfinger in the egg-cup, which contained vinegar, and smearing it over\nthe ink stains on her face, frowning the whole time and looking very\ngloomy.\n\n\"I wish Africa was dead!\" she said on a sudden.\n\nI was going to remonstrate.\n\n\"I do!\" she said \"Don't talk to me, Miss Summerson. I hate it and\ndetest it. It's a beast!\"\n\nI told her she was tired, and I was sorry. I put my hand upon her\nhead, and touched her forehead, and said it was hot now but would be\ncool to-morrow. She still stood pouting and frowning at me, but\npresently put down her egg-cup and turned softly towards the bed\nwhere Ada lay.\n\n\"She is very pretty!\" she said with the same knitted brow and in the\nsame uncivil manner.\n\nI assented with a smile.\n\n\"An orphan. Ain't she?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"But knows a quantity, I suppose? Can dance, and play music, and\nsing? She can talk French, I suppose, and do geography, and globes,\nand needlework, and everything?\"\n\n\"No doubt,\" said I.\n\n\"I can't,\" she returned. \"I can't do anything hardly, except write.\nI'm always writing for Ma. I wonder you two were not ashamed of\nyourselves to come in this afternoon and see me able to do nothing\nelse. It was like your ill nature. Yet you think yourselves very\nfine, I dare say!\"\n\nI could see that the poor girl was near crying, and I resumed my\nchair without speaking and looked at her (I hope) as mildly as I felt\ntowards her.\n\n\"It's disgraceful,\" she said. \"You know it is. The whole house is\ndisgraceful. The children are disgraceful. I'M disgraceful. Pa's\nmiserable, and no wonder! Priscilla drinks--she's always drinking.\nIt's a great shame and a great story of you if you say you didn't\nsmell her to-day. It was as bad as a public-house, waiting at dinner;\nyou know it was!\"\n\n\"My dear, I don't know it,\" said I.\n\n\"You do,\" she said very shortly. \"You shan't say you don't. You do!\"\n\n\"Oh, my dear!\" said I. \"If you won't let me speak--\"\n\n\"You're speaking now. You know you are. Don't tell stories, Miss\nSummerson.\"\n\n\"My dear,\" said I, \"as long as you won't hear me out--\"\n\n\"I don't want to hear you out.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, I think you do,\" said I, \"because that would be so very\nunreasonable. I did not know what you tell me because the servant did\nnot come near me at dinner; but I don't doubt what you tell me, and I\nam sorry to hear it.\"\n\n\"You needn't make a merit of that,\" said she.\n\n\"No, my dear,\" said I. \"That would be very foolish.\"\n\nShe was still standing by the bed, and now stooped down (but still\nwith the same discontented face) and kissed Ada. That done, she came\nsoftly back and stood by the side of my chair. Her bosom was heaving\nin a distressful manner that I greatly pitied, but I thought it\nbetter not to speak.\n\n\"I wish I was dead!\" she broke out. \"I wish we were all dead. It\nwould be a great deal better for us.\"\n\nIn a moment afterwards, she knelt on the ground at my side, hid her\nface in my dress, passionately begged my pardon, and wept. I\ncomforted her and would have raised her, but she cried no, no; she\nwanted to stay there!\n\n\"You used to teach girls,\" she said, \"If you could only have taught\nme, I could have learnt from you! I am so very miserable, and I like\nyou so much!\"\n\nI could not persuade her to sit by me or to do anything but move a\nragged stool to where she was kneeling, and take that, and still hold\nmy dress in the same manner. By degrees the poor tired girl fell\nasleep, and then I contrived to raise her head so that it should rest\non my lap, and to cover us both with shawls. The fire went out, and\nall night long she slumbered thus before the ashy grate. At first I\nwas painfully awake and vainly tried to lose myself, with my eyes\nclosed, among the scenes of the day. At length, by slow degrees, they\nbecame indistinct and mingled. I began to lose the identity of the\nsleeper resting on me. Now it was Ada, now one of my old Reading\nfriends from whom I could not believe I had so recently parted. Now\nit was the little mad woman worn out with curtsying and smiling, now\nsome one in authority at Bleak House. Lastly, it was no one, and I\nwas no one.\n\nThe purblind day was feebly struggling with the fog when I opened my\neyes to encounter those of a dirty-faced little spectre fixed upon\nme. Peepy had scaled his crib, and crept down in his bed-gown and\ncap, and was so cold that his teeth were chattering as if he had cut\nthem all.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V\n\nA Morning Adventure\n\n\nAlthough the morning was raw, and although the fog still seemed\nheavy--I say seemed, for the windows were so encrusted with dirt that\nthey would have made midsummer sunshine dim--I was sufficiently\nforewarned of the discomfort within doors at that early hour and\nsufficiently curious about London to think it a good idea on the part\nof Miss Jellyby when she proposed that we should go out for a walk.\n\n\"Ma won't be down for ever so long,\" she said, \"and then it's a\nchance if breakfast's ready for an hour afterwards, they dawdle so.\nAs to Pa, he gets what he can and goes to the office. He never has\nwhat you would call a regular breakfast. Priscilla leaves him out the\nloaf and some milk, when there is any, overnight. Sometimes there\nisn't any milk, and sometimes the cat drinks it. But I'm afraid you\nmust be tired, Miss Summerson, and perhaps you would rather go to\nbed.\"\n\n\"I am not at all tired, my dear,\" said I, \"and would much prefer to\ngo out.\"\n\n\"If you're sure you would,\" returned Miss Jellyby, \"I'll get my\nthings on.\"\n\nAda said she would go too, and was soon astir. I made a proposal to\nPeepy, in default of being able to do anything better for him, that\nhe should let me wash him and afterwards lay him down on my bed\nagain. To this he submitted with the best grace possible, staring at\nme during the whole operation as if he never had been, and never\ncould again be, so astonished in his life--looking very miserable\nalso, certainly, but making no complaint, and going snugly to sleep\nas soon as it was over. At first I was in two minds about taking such\na liberty, but I soon reflected that nobody in the house was likely\nto notice it.\n\nWhat with the bustle of dispatching Peepy and the bustle of getting\nmyself ready and helping Ada, I was soon quite in a glow. We found\nMiss Jellyby trying to warm herself at the fire in the writing-room,\nwhich Priscilla was then lighting with a smutty parlour candlestick,\nthrowing the candle in to make it burn better. Everything was just as\nwe had left it last night and was evidently intended to remain so.\nBelow-stairs the dinner-cloth had not been taken away, but had been\nleft ready for breakfast. Crumbs, dust, and waste-paper were all over\nthe house. Some pewter pots and a milk-can hung on the area railings;\nthe door stood open; and we met the cook round the corner coming out\nof a public-house, wiping her mouth. She mentioned, as she passed us,\nthat she had been to see what o'clock it was.\n\nBut before we met the cook, we met Richard, who was dancing up and\ndown Thavies Inn to warm his feet. He was agreeably surprised to see\nus stirring so soon and said he would gladly share our walk. So he\ntook care of Ada, and Miss Jellyby and I went first. I may mention\nthat Miss Jellyby had relapsed into her sulky manner and that I\nreally should not have thought she liked me much unless she had told\nme so.\n\n\"Where would you wish to go?\" she asked.\n\n\"Anywhere, my dear,\" I replied.\n\n\"Anywhere's nowhere,\" said Miss Jellyby, stopping perversely.\n\n\"Let us go somewhere at any rate,\" said I.\n\nShe then walked me on very fast.\n\n\"I don't care!\" she said. \"Now, you are my witness, Miss Summerson, I\nsay I don't care--but if he was to come to our house with his great,\nshining, lumpy forehead night after night till he was as old as\nMethuselah, I wouldn't have anything to say to him. Such ASSES as he\nand Ma make of themselves!\"\n\n\"My dear!\" I remonstrated, in allusion to the epithet and the\nvigorous emphasis Miss Jellyby set upon it. \"Your duty as a child--\"\n\n\"Oh! Don't talk of duty as a child, Miss Summerson; where's Ma's duty\nas a parent? All made over to the public and Africa, I suppose! Then\nlet the public and Africa show duty as a child; it's much more their\naffair than mine. You are shocked, I dare say! Very well, so am I\nshocked too; so we are both shocked, and there's an end of it!\"\n\nShe walked me on faster yet.\n\n\"But for all that, I say again, he may come, and come, and come, and\nI won't have anything to say to him. I can't bear him. If there's any\nstuff in the world that I hate and detest, it's the stuff he and Ma\ntalk. I wonder the very paving-stones opposite our house can have the\npatience to stay there and be a witness of such inconsistencies and\ncontradictions as all that sounding nonsense, and Ma's management!\"\n\nI could not but understand her to refer to Mr. Quale, the young\ngentleman who had appeared after dinner yesterday. I was saved the\ndisagreeable necessity of pursuing the subject by Richard and Ada\ncoming up at a round pace, laughing and asking us if we meant to run\na race. Thus interrupted, Miss Jellyby became silent and walked\nmoodily on at my side while I admired the long successions and\nvarieties of streets, the quantity of people already going to and\nfro, the number of vehicles passing and repassing, the busy\npreparations in the setting forth of shop windows and the sweeping\nout of shops, and the extraordinary creatures in rags secretly\ngroping among the swept-out rubbish for pins and other refuse.\n\n\"So, cousin,\" said the cheerful voice of Richard to Ada behind me.\n\"We are never to get out of Chancery! We have come by another way to\nour place of meeting yesterday, and--by the Great Seal, here's the\nold lady again!\"\n\nTruly, there she was, immediately in front of us, curtsying, and\nsmiling, and saying with her yesterday's air of patronage, \"The wards\nin Jarndyce! Ve-ry happy, I am sure!\"\n\n\"You are out early, ma'am,\" said I as she curtsied to me.\n\n\"Ye-es! I usually walk here early. Before the court sits. It's\nretired. I collect my thoughts here for the business of the day,\"\nsaid the old lady mincingly. \"The business of the day requires a\ngreat deal of thought. Chancery justice is so ve-ry difficult to\nfollow.\"\n\n\"Who's this, Miss Summerson?\" whispered Miss Jellyby, drawing my arm\ntighter through her own.\n\nThe little old lady's hearing was remarkably quick. She answered for\nherself directly.\n\n\"A suitor, my child. At your service. I have the honour to attend\ncourt regularly. With my documents. Have I the pleasure of addressing\nanother of the youthful parties in Jarndyce?\" said the old lady,\nrecovering herself, with her head on one side, from a very low\ncurtsy.\n\nRichard, anxious to atone for his thoughtlessness of yesterday,\ngood-naturedly explained that Miss Jellyby was not connected with the\nsuit.\n\n\"Ha!\" said the old lady. \"She does not expect a judgment? She will\nstill grow old. But not so old. Oh, dear, no! This is the garden of\nLincoln's Inn. I call it my garden. It is quite a bower in the\nsummer-time. Where the birds sing melodiously. I pass the greater\npart of the long vacation here. In contemplation. You find the long\nvacation exceedingly long, don't you?\"\n\nWe said yes, as she seemed to expect us to say so.\n\n\"When the leaves are falling from the trees and there are no more\nflowers in bloom to make up into nosegays for the Lord Chancellor's\ncourt,\" said the old lady, \"the vacation is fulfilled and the sixth\nseal, mentioned in the Revelations, again prevails. Pray come and see\nmy lodging. It will be a good omen for me. Youth, and hope, and\nbeauty are very seldom there. It is a long, long time since I had a\nvisit from either.\"\n\nShe had taken my hand, and leading me and Miss Jellyby away, beckoned\nRichard and Ada to come too. I did not know how to excuse myself and\nlooked to Richard for aid. As he was half amused and half curious and\nall in doubt how to get rid of the old lady without offence, she\ncontinued to lead us away, and he and Ada continued to follow, our\nstrange conductress informing us all the time, with much smiling\ncondescension, that she lived close by.\n\nIt was quite true, as it soon appeared. She lived so close by that we\nhad not time to have done humouring her for a few moments before she\nwas at home. Slipping us out at a little side gate, the old lady\nstopped most unexpectedly in a narrow back street, part of some\ncourts and lanes immediately outside the wall of the inn, and said,\n\"This is my lodging. Pray walk up!\"\n\nShe had stopped at a shop over which was written KROOK, RAG AND\nBOTTLE WAREHOUSE. Also, in long thin letters, KROOK, DEALER IN MARINE\nSTORES. In one part of the window was a picture of a red paper mill\nat which a cart was unloading a quantity of sacks of old rags. In\nanother was the inscription BONES BOUGHT. In another, KITCHEN-STUFF\nBOUGHT. In another, OLD IRON BOUGHT. In another, WASTE-PAPER BOUGHT.\nIn another, LADIES' AND GENTLEMEN'S WARDROBES BOUGHT. Everything\nseemed to be bought and nothing to be sold there. In all parts of the\nwindow were quantities of dirty bottles--blacking bottles, medicine\nbottles, ginger-beer and soda-water bottles, pickle bottles, wine\nbottles, ink bottles; I am reminded by mentioning the latter that the\nshop had in several little particulars the air of being in a legal\nneighbourhood and of being, as it were, a dirty hanger-on and\ndisowned relation of the law. There were a great many ink bottles.\nThere was a little tottering bench of shabby old volumes outside the\ndoor, labelled \"Law Books, all at 9d.\" Some of the inscriptions I\nhave enumerated were written in law-hand, like the papers I had seen\nin Kenge and Carboy's office and the letters I had so long received\nfrom the firm. Among them was one, in the same writing, having\nnothing to do with the business of the shop, but announcing that a\nrespectable man aged forty-five wanted engrossing or copying to\nexecute with neatness and dispatch: Address to Nemo, care of Mr.\nKrook, within. There were several second-hand bags, blue and red,\nhanging up. A little way within the shop-door lay heaps of old\ncrackled parchment scrolls and discoloured and dog's-eared\nlaw-papers. I could have fancied that all the rusty keys, of which\nthere must have been hundreds huddled together as old iron, had once\nbelonged to doors of rooms or strong chests in lawyers' offices. The\nlitter of rags tumbled partly into and partly out of a one-legged\nwooden scale, hanging without any counterpoise from a beam, might\nhave been counsellors' bands and gowns torn up. One had only to\nfancy, as Richard whispered to Ada and me while we all stood looking\nin, that yonder bones in a corner, piled together and picked very\nclean, were the bones of clients, to make the picture complete.\n\nAs it was still foggy and dark, and as the shop was blinded besides\nby the wall of Lincoln's Inn, intercepting the light within a couple\nof yards, we should not have seen so much but for a lighted lantern\nthat an old man in spectacles and a hairy cap was carrying about in\nthe shop. Turning towards the door, he now caught sight of us. He was\nshort, cadaverous, and withered, with his head sunk sideways between\nhis shoulders and the breath issuing in visible smoke from his mouth\nas if he were on fire within. His throat, chin, and eyebrows were so\nfrosted with white hairs and so gnarled with veins and puckered skin\nthat he looked from his breast upward like some old root in a fall of\nsnow.\n\n\"Hi, hi!\" said the old man, coming to the door. \"Have you anything to\nsell?\"\n\nWe naturally drew back and glanced at our conductress, who had been\ntrying to open the house-door with a key she had taken from her\npocket, and to whom Richard now said that as we had had the pleasure\nof seeing where she lived, we would leave her, being pressed for\ntime. But she was not to be so easily left. She became so\nfantastically and pressingly earnest in her entreaties that we would\nwalk up and see her apartment for an instant, and was so bent, in her\nharmless way, on leading me in, as part of the good omen she desired,\nthat I (whatever the others might do) saw nothing for it but to\ncomply. I suppose we were all more or less curious; at any rate, when\nthe old man added his persuasions to hers and said, \"Aye, aye! Please\nher! It won't take a minute! Come in, come in! Come in through the\nshop if t'other door's out of order!\" we all went in, stimulated by\nRichard's laughing encouragement and relying on his protection.\n\n\"My landlord, Krook,\" said the little old lady, condescending to him\nfrom her lofty station as she presented him to us. \"He is called\namong the neighbours the Lord Chancellor. His shop is called the\nCourt of Chancery. He is a very eccentric person. He is very odd. Oh,\nI assure you he is very odd!\"\n\nShe shook her head a great many times and tapped her forehead with\nher finger to express to us that we must have the goodness to excuse\nhim, \"For he is a little--you know--M!\" said the old lady with great\nstateliness. The old man overheard, and laughed.\n\n\"It's true enough,\" he said, going before us with the lantern, \"that\nthey call me the Lord Chancellor and call my shop Chancery. And why\ndo you think they call me the Lord Chancellor and my shop Chancery?\"\n\n\"I don't know, I am sure!\" said Richard rather carelessly.\n\n\"You see,\" said the old man, stopping and turning round, \"they--Hi!\nHere's lovely hair! I have got three sacks of ladies' hair below, but\nnone so beautiful and fine as this. What colour, and what texture!\"\n\n\"That'll do, my good friend!\" said Richard, strongly disapproving of\nhis having drawn one of Ada's tresses through his yellow hand. \"You\ncan admire as the rest of us do without taking that liberty.\"\n\nThe old man darted at him a sudden look which even called my\nattention from Ada, who, startled and blushing, was so remarkably\nbeautiful that she seemed to fix the wandering attention of the\nlittle old lady herself. But as Ada interposed and laughingly said\nshe could only feel proud of such genuine admiration, Mr. Krook\nshrunk into his former self as suddenly as he had leaped out of it.\n\n\"You see, I have so many things here,\" he resumed, holding up the\nlantern, \"of so many kinds, and all as the neighbours think (but THEY\nknow nothing), wasting away and going to rack and ruin, that that's\nwhy they have given me and my place a christening. And I have so many\nold parchmentses and papers in my stock. And I have a liking for rust\nand must and cobwebs. And all's fish that comes to my net. And I\ncan't abear to part with anything I once lay hold of (or so my\nneighbours think, but what do THEY know?) or to alter anything, or to\nhave any sweeping, nor scouring, nor cleaning, nor repairing going on\nabout me. That's the way I've got the ill name of Chancery. I don't\nmind. I go to see my noble and learned brother pretty well every day,\nwhen he sits in the Inn. He don't notice me, but I notice him.\nThere's no great odds betwixt us. We both grub on in a muddle. Hi,\nLady Jane!\"\n\nA large grey cat leaped from some neighbouring shelf on his shoulder\nand startled us all.\n\n\"Hi! Show 'em how you scratch. Hi! Tear, my lady!\" said her master.\n\nThe cat leaped down and ripped at a bundle of rags with her tigerish\nclaws, with a sound that it set my teeth on edge to hear.\n\n\"She'd do as much for any one I was to set her on,\" said the old man.\n\"I deal in cat-skins among other general matters, and hers was\noffered to me. It's a very fine skin, as you may see, but I didn't\nhave it stripped off! THAT warn't like Chancery practice though, says\nyou!\"\n\nHe had by this time led us across the shop, and now opened a door in\nthe back part of it, leading to the house-entry. As he stood with his\nhand upon the lock, the little old lady graciously observed to him\nbefore passing out, \"That will do, Krook. You mean well, but are\ntiresome. My young friends are pressed for time. I have none to spare\nmyself, having to attend court very soon. My young friends are the\nwards in Jarndyce.\"\n\n\"Jarndyce!\" said the old man with a start.\n\n\"Jarndyce and Jarndyce. The great suit, Krook,\" returned his lodger.\n\n\"Hi!\" exclaimed the old man in a tone of thoughtful amazement and\nwith a wider stare than before. \"Think of it!\"\n\nHe seemed so rapt all in a moment and looked so curiously at us that\nRichard said, \"Why, you appear to trouble yourself a good deal about\nthe causes before your noble and learned brother, the other\nChancellor!\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said the old man abstractedly. \"Sure! YOUR name now will be--\"\n\n\"Richard Carstone.\"\n\n\"Carstone,\" he repeated, slowly checking off that name upon his\nforefinger; and each of the others he went on to mention upon a\nseparate finger. \"Yes. There was the name of Barbary, and the name of\nClare, and the name of Dedlock, too, I think.\"\n\n\"He knows as much of the cause as the real salaried Chancellor!\" said\nRichard, quite astonished, to Ada and me.\n\n\"Aye!\" said the old man, coming slowly out of his abstraction. \"Yes!\nTom Jarndyce--you'll excuse me, being related; but he was never known\nabout court by any other name, and was as well known there as--she is\nnow,\" nodding slightly at his lodger. \"Tom Jarndyce was often in\nhere. He got into a restless habit of strolling about when the cause\nwas on, or expected, talking to the little shopkeepers and telling\n'em to keep out of Chancery, whatever they did. 'For,' says he, 'it's\nbeing ground to bits in a slow mill; it's being roasted at a slow\nfire; it's being stung to death by single bees; it's being drowned by\ndrops; it's going mad by grains.' He was as near making away with\nhimself, just where the young lady stands, as near could be.\"\n\nWe listened with horror.\n\n\"He come in at the door,\" said the old man, slowly pointing an\nimaginary track along the shop, \"on the day he did it--the whole\nneighbourhood had said for months before that he would do it, of a\ncertainty sooner or later--he come in at the door that day, and\nwalked along there, and sat himself on a bench that stood there, and\nasked me (you'll judge I was a mortal sight younger then) to fetch\nhim a pint of wine. 'For,' says he, 'Krook, I am much depressed; my\ncause is on again, and I think I'm nearer judgment than I ever was.'\nI hadn't a mind to leave him alone; and I persuaded him to go to the\ntavern over the way there, t'other side my lane (I mean Chancery\nLane); and I followed and looked in at the window, and saw him,\ncomfortable as I thought, in the arm-chair by the fire, and company\nwith him. I hadn't hardly got back here when I heard a shot go\nechoing and rattling right away into the inn. I ran out--neighbours\nran out--twenty of us cried at once, 'Tom Jarndyce!'\"\n\nThe old man stopped, looked hard at us, looked down into the lantern,\nblew the light out, and shut the lantern up.\n\n\"We were right, I needn't tell the present hearers. Hi! To be sure,\nhow the neighbourhood poured into court that afternoon while the\ncause was on! How my noble and learned brother, and all the rest of\n'em, grubbed and muddled away as usual and tried to look as if they\nhadn't heard a word of the last fact in the case or as if they\nhad--Oh, dear me!--nothing at all to do with it if they had heard of\nit by any chance!\"\n\nAda's colour had entirely left her, and Richard was scarcely less\npale. Nor could I wonder, judging even from my emotions, and I was no\nparty in the suit, that to hearts so untried and fresh it was a shock\nto come into the inheritance of a protracted misery, attended in the\nminds of many people with such dreadful recollections. I had another\nuneasiness, in the application of the painful story to the poor\nhalf-witted creature who had brought us there; but, to my surprise,\nshe seemed perfectly unconscious of that and only led the way\nupstairs again, informing us with the toleration of a superior\ncreature for the infirmities of a common mortal that her landlord was\n\"a little M, you know!\"\n\nShe lived at the top of the house, in a pretty large room, from which\nshe had a glimpse of Lincoln's Inn Hall. This seemed to have been her\nprincipal inducement, originally, for taking up her residence there.\nShe could look at it, she said, in the night, especially in the\nmoonshine. Her room was clean, but very, very bare. I noticed the\nscantiest necessaries in the way of furniture; a few old prints from\nbooks, of Chancellors and barristers, wafered against the wall; and\nsome half-dozen reticles and work-bags, \"containing documents,\" as\nshe informed us. There were neither coals nor ashes in the grate, and\nI saw no articles of clothing anywhere, nor any kind of food. Upon a\nshelf in an open cupboard were a plate or two, a cup or two, and so\nforth, but all dry and empty. There was a more affecting meaning in\nher pinched appearance, I thought as I looked round, than I had\nunderstood before.\n\n\"Extremely honoured, I am sure,\" said our poor hostess with the\ngreatest suavity, \"by this visit from the wards in Jarndyce. And very\nmuch indebted for the omen. It is a retired situation. Considering. I\nam limited as to situation. In consequence of the necessity of\nattending on the Chancellor. I have lived here many years. I pass my\ndays in court, my evenings and my nights here. I find the nights\nlong, for I sleep but little and think much. That is, of course,\nunavoidable, being in Chancery. I am sorry I cannot offer chocolate.\nI expect a judgment shortly and shall then place my establishment on\na superior footing. At present, I don't mind confessing to the wards\nin Jarndyce (in strict confidence) that I sometimes find it difficult\nto keep up a genteel appearance. I have felt the cold here. I have\nfelt something sharper than cold. It matters very little. Pray excuse\nthe introduction of such mean topics.\"\n\nShe partly drew aside the curtain of the long, low garret window and\ncalled our attention to a number of bird-cages hanging there, some\ncontaining several birds. There were larks, linnets, and\ngoldfinches--I should think at least twenty.\n\n\"I began to keep the little creatures,\" she said, \"with an object\nthat the wards will readily comprehend. With the intention of\nrestoring them to liberty. When my judgment should be given. Ye-es!\nThey die in prison, though. Their lives, poor silly things, are so\nshort in comparison with Chancery proceedings that, one by one, the\nwhole collection has died over and over again. I doubt, do you know,\nwhether one of these, though they are all young, will live to be\nfree! Ve-ry mortifying, is it not?\"\n\nAlthough she sometimes asked a question, she never seemed to expect a\nreply, but rambled on as if she were in the habit of doing so when no\none but herself was present.\n\n\"Indeed,\" she pursued, \"I positively doubt sometimes, I do assure\nyou, whether while matters are still unsettled, and the sixth or\nGreat Seal still prevails, I may not one day be found lying stark and\nsenseless here, as I have found so many birds!\"\n\nRichard, answering what he saw in Ada's compassionate eyes, took the\nopportunity of laying some money, softly and unobserved, on the\nchimney-piece. We all drew nearer to the cages, feigning to examine\nthe birds.\n\n\"I can't allow them to sing much,\" said the little old lady, \"for\n(you'll think this curious) I find my mind confused by the idea that\nthey are singing while I am following the arguments in court. And my\nmind requires to be so very clear, you know! Another time, I'll tell\nyou their names. Not at present. On a day of such good omen, they\nshall sing as much as they like. In honour of youth,\" a smile and\ncurtsy, \"hope,\" a smile and curtsy, \"and beauty,\" a smile and curtsy.\n\"There! We'll let in the full light.\"\n\nThe birds began to stir and chirp.\n\n\"I cannot admit the air freely,\" said the little old lady--the room\nwas close, and would have been the better for it--\"because the cat\nyou saw downstairs, called Lady Jane, is greedy for their lives. She\ncrouches on the parapet outside for hours and hours. I have\ndiscovered,\" whispering mysteriously, \"that her natural cruelty is\nsharpened by a jealous fear of their regaining their liberty. In\nconsequence of the judgment I expect being shortly given. She is sly\nand full of malice. I half believe, sometimes, that she is no cat,\nbut the wolf of the old saying. It is so very difficult to keep her\nfrom the door.\"\n\nSome neighbouring bells, reminding the poor soul that it was\nhalf-past nine, did more for us in the way of bringing our visit to\nan end than we could easily have done for ourselves. She hurriedly\ntook up her little bag of documents, which she had laid upon the\ntable on coming in, and asked if we were also going into court. On\nour answering no, and that we would on no account detain her, she\nopened the door to attend us downstairs.\n\n\"With such an omen, it is even more necessary than usual that I\nshould be there before the Chancellor comes in,\" said she, \"for he\nmight mention my case the first thing. I have a presentiment that he\nWILL mention it the first thing this morning.\"\n\nShe stopped to tell us in a whisper as we were going down that the\nwhole house was filled with strange lumber which her landlord had\nbought piecemeal and had no wish to sell, in consequence of being a\nlittle M. This was on the first floor. But she had made a previous\nstoppage on the second floor and had silently pointed at a dark door\nthere.\n\n\"The only other lodger,\" she now whispered in explanation, \"a\nlaw-writer. The children in the lanes here say he has sold himself to\nthe devil. I don't know what he can have done with the money. Hush!\"\n\nShe appeared to mistrust that the lodger might hear her even there,\nand repeating \"Hush!\" went before us on tiptoe as though even the\nsound of her footsteps might reveal to him what she had said.\n\nPassing through the shop on our way out, as we had passed through it\non our way in, we found the old man storing a quantity of packets of\nwaste-paper in a kind of well in the floor. He seemed to be working\nhard, with the perspiration standing on his forehead, and had a piece\nof chalk by him, with which, as he put each separate package or\nbundle down, he made a crooked mark on the panelling of the wall.\n\nRichard and Ada, and Miss Jellyby, and the little old lady had gone\nby him, and I was going when he touched me on the arm to stay me, and\nchalked the letter J upon the wall--in a very curious manner,\nbeginning with the end of the letter and shaping it backward. It was\na capital letter, not a printed one, but just such a letter as any\nclerk in Messrs. Kenge and Carboy's office would have made.\n\n\"Can you read it?\" he asked me with a keen glance.\n\n\"Surely,\" said I. \"It's very plain.\"\n\n\"What is it?\"\n\n\"J.\"\n\nWith another glance at me, and a glance at the door, he rubbed it out\nand turned an \"a\" in its place (not a capital letter this time), and\nsaid, \"What's that?\"\n\nI told him. He then rubbed that out and turned the letter \"r,\" and\nasked me the same question. He went on quickly until he had formed in\nthe same curious manner, beginning at the ends and bottoms of the\nletters, the word Jarndyce, without once leaving two letters on the\nwall together.\n\n\"What does that spell?\" he asked me.\n\nWhen I told him, he laughed. In the same odd way, yet with the same\nrapidity, he then produced singly, and rubbed out singly, the letters\nforming the words Bleak House. These, in some astonishment, I also\nread; and he laughed again.\n\n\"Hi!\" said the old man, laying aside the chalk. \"I have a turn for\ncopying from memory, you see, miss, though I can neither read nor\nwrite.\"\n\nHe looked so disagreeable and his cat looked so wickedly at me, as if\nI were a blood-relation of the birds upstairs, that I was quite\nrelieved by Richard's appearing at the door and saying, \"Miss\nSummerson, I hope you are not bargaining for the sale of your hair.\nDon't be tempted. Three sacks below are quite enough for Mr. Krook!\"\n\nI lost no time in wishing Mr. Krook good morning and joining my\nfriends outside, where we parted with the little old lady, who gave\nus her blessing with great ceremony and renewed her assurance of\nyesterday in reference to her intention of settling estates on Ada\nand me. Before we finally turned out of those lanes, we looked back\nand saw Mr. Krook standing at his shop-door, in his spectacles,\nlooking after us, with his cat upon his shoulder, and her tail\nsticking up on one side of his hairy cap like a tall feather.\n\n\"Quite an adventure for a morning in London!\" said Richard with a\nsigh. \"Ah, cousin, cousin, it's a weary word this Chancery!\"\n\n\"It is to me, and has been ever since I can remember,\" returned Ada.\n\"I am grieved that I should be the enemy--as I suppose I am--of a\ngreat number of relations and others, and that they should be my\nenemies--as I suppose they are--and that we should all be ruining one\nanother without knowing how or why and be in constant doubt and\ndiscord all our lives. It seems very strange, as there must be right\nsomewhere, that an honest judge in real earnest has not been able to\nfind out through all these years where it is.\"\n\n\"Ah, cousin!\" said Richard. \"Strange, indeed! All this wasteful,\nwanton chess-playing IS very strange. To see that composed court\nyesterday jogging on so serenely and to think of the wretchedness of\nthe pieces on the board gave me the headache and the heartache both\ntogether. My head ached with wondering how it happened, if men were\nneither fools nor rascals; and my heart ached to think they could\npossibly be either. But at all events, Ada--I may call you Ada?\"\n\n\"Of course you may, cousin Richard.\"\n\n\"At all events, Chancery will work none of its bad influences on US.\nWe have happily been brought together, thanks to our good kinsman,\nand it can't divide us now!\"\n\n\"Never, I hope, cousin Richard!\" said Ada gently.\n\nMiss Jellyby gave my arm a squeeze and me a very significant look. I\nsmiled in return, and we made the rest of the way back very\npleasantly.\n\nIn half an hour after our arrival, Mrs. Jellyby appeared; and in the\ncourse of an hour the various things necessary for breakfast\nstraggled one by one into the dining-room. I do not doubt that Mrs.\nJellyby had gone to bed and got up in the usual manner, but she\npresented no appearance of having changed her dress. She was greatly\noccupied during breakfast, for the morning's post brought a heavy\ncorrespondence relative to Borrioboola-Gha, which would occasion her\n(she said) to pass a busy day. The children tumbled about, and\nnotched memoranda of their accidents in their legs, which were\nperfect little calendars of distress; and Peepy was lost for an hour\nand a half, and brought home from Newgate market by a policeman. The\nequable manner in which Mrs. Jellyby sustained both his absence and\nhis restoration to the family circle surprised us all.\n\nShe was by that time perseveringly dictating to Caddy, and Caddy was\nfast relapsing into the inky condition in which we had found her. At\none o'clock an open carriage arrived for us, and a cart for our\nluggage. Mrs. Jellyby charged us with many remembrances to her good\nfriend Mr. Jarndyce; Caddy left her desk to see us depart, kissed me\nin the passage, and stood biting her pen and sobbing on the steps;\nPeepy, I am happy to say, was asleep and spared the pain of\nseparation (I was not without misgivings that he had gone to Newgate\nmarket in search of me); and all the other children got up behind the\nbarouche and fell off, and we saw them, with great concern, scattered\nover the surface of Thavies Inn as we rolled out of its precincts.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI\n\nQuite at Home\n\n\nThe day had brightened very much, and still brightened as we went\nwestward. We went our way through the sunshine and the fresh air,\nwondering more and more at the extent of the streets, the brilliancy\nof the shops, the great traffic, and the crowds of people whom the\npleasanter weather seemed to have brought out like many-coloured\nflowers. By and by we began to leave the wonderful city and to\nproceed through suburbs which, of themselves, would have made a\npretty large town in my eyes; and at last we got into a real country\nroad again, with windmills, rick-yards, milestones, farmers' waggons,\nscents of old hay, swinging signs, and horse troughs: trees, fields,\nand hedge-rows. It was delightful to see the green landscape before\nus and the immense metropolis behind; and when a waggon with a train\nof beautiful horses, furnished with red trappings and clear-sounding\nbells, came by us with its music, I believe we could all three have\nsung to the bells, so cheerful were the influences around.\n\n\"The whole road has been reminding me of my namesake Whittington,\"\nsaid Richard, \"and that waggon is the finishing touch. Halloa! What's\nthe matter?\"\n\nWe had stopped, and the waggon had stopped too. Its music changed as\nthe horses came to a stand, and subsided to a gentle tinkling, except\nwhen a horse tossed his head or shook himself and sprinkled off a\nlittle shower of bell-ringing.\n\n\"Our postilion is looking after the waggoner,\" said Richard, \"and the\nwaggoner is coming back after us. Good day, friend!\" The waggoner was\nat our coach-door. \"Why, here's an extraordinary thing!\" added\nRichard, looking closely at the man. \"He has got your name, Ada, in\nhis hat!\"\n\nHe had all our names in his hat. Tucked within the band were three\nsmall notes--one addressed to Ada, one to Richard, one to me. These\nthe waggoner delivered to each of us respectively, reading the name\naloud first. In answer to Richard's inquiry from whom they came, he\nbriefly answered, \"Master, sir, if you please\"; and putting on his\nhat again (which was like a soft bowl), cracked his whip, re-awakened\nhis music, and went melodiously away.\n\n\"Is that Mr. Jarndyce's waggon?\" said Richard, calling to our\npost-boy.\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" he replied. \"Going to London.\"\n\nWe opened the notes. Each was a counterpart of the other and\ncontained these words in a solid, plain hand.\n\n\n   I look forward, my dear, to our meeting easily and\n   without constraint on either side. I therefore have to\n   propose that we meet as old friends and take the past for\n   granted. It will be a relief to you possibly, and to me\n   certainly, and so my love to you.\n\n   John Jarndyce\n\n\nI had perhaps less reason to be surprised than either of my\ncompanions, having never yet enjoyed an opportunity of thanking one\nwho had been my benefactor and sole earthly dependence through so\nmany years. I had not considered how I could thank him, my gratitude\nlying too deep in my heart for that; but I now began to consider how\nI could meet him without thanking him, and felt it would be very\ndifficult indeed.\n\nThe notes revived in Richard and Ada a general impression that they\nboth had, without quite knowing how they came by it, that their\ncousin Jarndyce could never bear acknowledgments for any kindness he\nperformed and that sooner than receive any he would resort to the\nmost singular expedients and evasions or would even run away. Ada\ndimly remembered to have heard her mother tell, when she was a very\nlittle child, that he had once done her an act of uncommon generosity\nand that on her going to his house to thank him, he happened to see\nher through a window coming to the door, and immediately escaped by\nthe back gate, and was not heard of for three months. This discourse\nled to a great deal more on the same theme, and indeed it lasted us\nall day, and we talked of scarcely anything else. If we did by any\nchance diverge into another subject, we soon returned to this, and\nwondered what the house would be like, and when we should get there,\nand whether we should see Mr. Jarndyce as soon as we arrived or after\na delay, and what he would say to us, and what we should say to him.\nAll of which we wondered about, over and over again.\n\nThe roads were very heavy for the horses, but the pathway was\ngenerally good, so we alighted and walked up all the hills, and liked\nit so well that we prolonged our walk on the level ground when we got\nto the top. At Barnet there were other horses waiting for us, but as\nthey had only just been fed, we had to wait for them too, and got a\nlong fresh walk over a common and an old battle-field before the\ncarriage came up. These delays so protracted the journey that the\nshort day was spent and the long night had closed in before we came\nto St. Albans, near to which town Bleak House was, we knew.\n\nBy that time we were so anxious and nervous that even Richard\nconfessed, as we rattled over the stones of the old street, to\nfeeling an irrational desire to drive back again. As to Ada and me,\nwhom he had wrapped up with great care, the night being sharp and\nfrosty, we trembled from head to foot. When we turned out of the\ntown, round a corner, and Richard told us that the post-boy, who had\nfor a long time sympathized with our heightened expectation, was\nlooking back and nodding, we both stood up in the carriage (Richard\nholding Ada lest she should be jolted down) and gazed round upon the\nopen country and the starlight night for our destination. There was a\nlight sparkling on the top of a hill before us, and the driver,\npointing to it with his whip and crying, \"That's Bleak House!\" put\nhis horses into a canter and took us forward at such a rate, uphill\nthough it was, that the wheels sent the road drift flying about our\nheads like spray from a water-mill. Presently we lost the light,\npresently saw it, presently lost it, presently saw it, and turned\ninto an avenue of trees and cantered up towards where it was beaming\nbrightly. It was in a window of what seemed to be an old-fashioned\nhouse with three peaks in the roof in front and a circular sweep\nleading to the porch. A bell was rung as we drew up, and amidst the\nsound of its deep voice in the still air, and the distant barking of\nsome dogs, and a gush of light from the opened door, and the smoking\nand steaming of the heated horses, and the quickened beating of our\nown hearts, we alighted in no inconsiderable confusion.\n\n\"Ada, my love, Esther, my dear, you are welcome. I rejoice to see\nyou! Rick, if I had a hand to spare at present, I would give it you!\"\n\nThe gentleman who said these words in a clear, bright, hospitable\nvoice had one of his arms round Ada's waist and the other round mine,\nand kissed us both in a fatherly way, and bore us across the hall\ninto a ruddy little room, all in a glow with a blazing fire. Here he\nkissed us again, and opening his arms, made us sit down side by side\non a sofa ready drawn out near the hearth. I felt that if we had been\nat all demonstrative, he would have run away in a moment.\n\n\"Now, Rick!\" said he. \"I have a hand at liberty. A word in earnest is\nas good as a speech. I am heartily glad to see you. You are at home.\nWarm yourself!\"\n\nRichard shook him by both hands with an intuitive mixture of respect\nand frankness, and only saying (though with an earnestness that\nrather alarmed me, I was so afraid of Mr. Jarndyce's suddenly\ndisappearing), \"You are very kind, sir! We are very much obliged to\nyou!\" laid aside his hat and coat and came up to the fire.\n\n\"And how did you like the ride? And how did you like Mrs. Jellyby, my\ndear?\" said Mr. Jarndyce to Ada.\n\nWhile Ada was speaking to him in reply, I glanced (I need not say\nwith how much interest) at his face. It was a handsome, lively, quick\nface, full of change and motion; and his hair was a silvered\niron-grey. I took him to be nearer sixty than fifty, but he was\nupright, hearty, and robust. From the moment of his first speaking to\nus his voice had connected itself with an association in my mind that\nI could not define; but now, all at once, a something sudden in his\nmanner and a pleasant expression in his eyes recalled the gentleman\nin the stagecoach six years ago on the memorable day of my journey to\nReading. I was certain it was he. I never was so frightened in my\nlife as when I made the discovery, for he caught my glance, and\nappearing to read my thoughts, gave such a look at the door that I\nthought we had lost him.\n\nHowever, I am happy to say he remained where he was, and asked me\nwhat I thought of Mrs. Jellyby.\n\n\"She exerts herself very much for Africa, sir,\" I said.\n\n\"Nobly!\" returned Mr. Jarndyce. \"But you answer like Ada.\" Whom I had\nnot heard. \"You all think something else, I see.\"\n\n\"We rather thought,\" said I, glancing at Richard and Ada, who\nentreated me with their eyes to speak, \"that perhaps she was a little\nunmindful of her home.\"\n\n\"Floored!\" cried Mr. Jarndyce.\n\nI was rather alarmed again.\n\n\"Well! I want to know your real thoughts, my dear. I may have sent\nyou there on purpose.\"\n\n\"We thought that, perhaps,\" said I, hesitating, \"it is right to begin\nwith the obligations of home, sir; and that, perhaps, while those are\noverlooked and neglected, no other duties can possibly be substituted\nfor them.\"\n\n\"The little Jellybys,\" said Richard, coming to my relief, \"are\nreally--I can't help expressing myself strongly, sir--in a devil of a\nstate.\"\n\n\"She means well,\" said Mr. Jarndyce hastily. \"The wind's in the\neast.\"\n\n\"It was in the north, sir, as we came down,\" observed Richard.\n\n\"My dear Rick,\" said Mr. Jarndyce, poking the fire, \"I'll take an\noath it's either in the east or going to be. I am always conscious of\nan uncomfortable sensation now and then when the wind is blowing in\nthe east.\"\n\n\"Rheumatism, sir?\" said Richard.\n\n\"I dare say it is, Rick. I believe it is. And so the little Jell--I\nhad my doubts about 'em--are in a--oh, Lord, yes, it's easterly!\"\nsaid Mr. Jarndyce.\n\nHe had taken two or three undecided turns up and down while uttering\nthese broken sentences, retaining the poker in one hand and rubbing\nhis hair with the other, with a good-natured vexation at once so\nwhimsical and so lovable that I am sure we were more delighted with\nhim than we could possibly have expressed in any words. He gave an\narm to Ada and an arm to me, and bidding Richard bring a candle, was\nleading the way out when he suddenly turned us all back again.\n\n\"Those little Jellybys. Couldn't you--didn't you--now, if it had\nrained sugar-plums, or three-cornered raspberry tarts, or anything of\nthat sort!\" said Mr. Jarndyce.\n\n\"Oh, cousin--\" Ada hastily began.\n\n\"Good, my pretty pet. I like cousin. Cousin John, perhaps, is\nbetter.\"\n\n\"Then, cousin John--\" Ada laughingly began again.\n\n\"Ha, ha! Very good indeed!\" said Mr. Jarndyce with great enjoyment.\n\"Sounds uncommonly natural. Yes, my dear?\"\n\n\"It did better than that. It rained Esther.\"\n\n\"Aye?\" said Mr. Jarndyce. \"What did Esther do?\"\n\n\"Why, cousin John,\" said Ada, clasping her hands upon his arm and\nshaking her head at me across him--for I wanted her to be\nquiet--\"Esther was their friend directly. Esther nursed them, coaxed\nthem to sleep, washed and dressed them, told them stories, kept them\nquiet, bought them keepsakes\"--My dear girl! I had only gone out with\nPeepy after he was found and given him a little, tiny horse!--\"and,\ncousin John, she softened poor Caroline, the eldest one, so much and\nwas so thoughtful for me and so amiable! No, no, I won't be\ncontradicted, Esther dear! You know, you know, it's true!\"\n\nThe warm-hearted darling leaned across her cousin John and kissed me,\nand then looking up in his face, boldly said, \"At all events, cousin\nJohn, I WILL thank you for the companion you have given me.\" I felt\nas if she challenged him to run away. But he didn't.\n\n\"Where did you say the wind was, Rick?\" asked Mr. Jarndyce.\n\n\"In the north as we came down, sir.\"\n\n\"You are right. There's no east in it. A mistake of mine. Come,\ngirls, come and see your home!\"\n\nIt was one of those delightfully irregular houses where you go up and\ndown steps out of one room into another, and where you come upon more\nrooms when you think you have seen all there are, and where there is\na bountiful provision of little halls and passages, and where you\nfind still older cottage-rooms in unexpected places with lattice\nwindows and green growth pressing through them. Mine, which we\nentered first, was of this kind, with an up-and-down roof that had\nmore corners in it than I ever counted afterwards and a chimney\n(there was a wood fire on the hearth) paved all around with pure\nwhite tiles, in every one of which a bright miniature of the fire was\nblazing. Out of this room, you went down two steps into a charming\nlittle sitting-room looking down upon a flower-garden, which room was\nhenceforth to belong to Ada and me. Out of this you went up three\nsteps into Ada's bedroom, which had a fine broad window commanding a\nbeautiful view (we saw a great expanse of darkness lying underneath\nthe stars), to which there was a hollow window-seat, in which, with a\nspring-lock, three dear Adas might have been lost at once. Out of\nthis room you passed into a little gallery, with which the other best\nrooms (only two) communicated, and so, by a little staircase of\nshallow steps with a number of corner stairs in it, considering its\nlength, down into the hall. But if instead of going out at Ada's door\nyou came back into my room, and went out at the door by which you had\nentered it, and turned up a few crooked steps that branched off in an\nunexpected manner from the stairs, you lost yourself in passages,\nwith mangles in them, and three-cornered tables, and a native Hindu\nchair, which was also a sofa, a box, and a bedstead, and looked in\nevery form something between a bamboo skeleton and a great bird-cage,\nand had been brought from India nobody knew by whom or when. From\nthese you came on Richard's room, which was part library, part\nsitting-room, part bedroom, and seemed indeed a comfortable compound\nof many rooms. Out of that you went straight, with a little interval\nof passage, to the plain room where Mr. Jarndyce slept, all the year\nround, with his window open, his bedstead without any furniture\nstanding in the middle of the floor for more air, and his cold bath\ngaping for him in a smaller room adjoining. Out of that you came into\nanother passage, where there were back-stairs and where you could\nhear the horses being rubbed down outside the stable and being told\nto \"Hold up\" and \"Get over,\" as they slipped about very much on the\nuneven stones. Or you might, if you came out at another door (every\nroom had at least two doors), go straight down to the hall again by\nhalf-a-dozen steps and a low archway, wondering how you got back\nthere or had ever got out of it.\n\nThe furniture, old-fashioned rather than old, like the house, was as\npleasantly irregular. Ada's sleeping-room was all flowers--in chintz\nand paper, in velvet, in needlework, in the brocade of two stiff\ncourtly chairs which stood, each attended by a little page of a stool\nfor greater state, on either side of the fire-place. Our sitting-room\nwas green and had framed and glazed upon the walls numbers of\nsurprising and surprised birds, staring out of pictures at a real\ntrout in a case, as brown and shining as if it had been served with\ngravy; at the death of Captain Cook; and at the whole process of\npreparing tea in China, as depicted by Chinese artists. In my room\nthere were oval engravings of the months--ladies haymaking in short\nwaists and large hats tied under the chin, for June; smooth-legged\nnoblemen pointing with cocked-hats to village steeples, for October.\nHalf-length portraits in crayons abounded all through the house, but\nwere so dispersed that I found the brother of a youthful officer of\nmine in the china-closet and the grey old age of my pretty young\nbride, with a flower in her bodice, in the breakfast-room. As\nsubstitutes, I had four angels, of Queen Anne's reign, taking a\ncomplacent gentleman to heaven, in festoons, with some difficulty;\nand a composition in needlework representing fruit, a kettle, and an\nalphabet. All the movables, from the wardrobes to the chairs and\ntables, hangings, glasses, even to the pincushions and scent-bottles\non the dressing-tables, displayed the same quaint variety. They\nagreed in nothing but their perfect neatness, their display of the\nwhitest linen, and their storing-up, wheresoever the existence of a\ndrawer, small or large, rendered it possible, of quantities of\nrose-leaves and sweet lavender. Such, with its illuminated windows,\nsoftened here and there by shadows of curtains, shining out upon the\nstarlight night; with its light, and warmth, and comfort; with its\nhospitable jingle, at a distance, of preparations for dinner; with\nthe face of its generous master brightening everything we saw; and\njust wind enough without to sound a low accompaniment to everything\nwe heard, were our first impressions of Bleak House.\n\n\"I am glad you like it,\" said Mr. Jarndyce when he had brought us\nround again to Ada's sitting-room. \"It makes no pretensions, but it\nis a comfortable little place, I hope, and will be more so with such\nbright young looks in it. You have barely half an hour before dinner.\nThere's no one here but the finest creature upon earth--a child.\"\n\n\"More children, Esther!\" said Ada.\n\n\"I don't mean literally a child,\" pursued Mr. Jarndyce; \"not a child\nin years. He is grown up--he is at least as old as I am--but in\nsimplicity, and freshness, and enthusiasm, and a fine guileless\ninaptitude for all worldly affairs, he is a perfect child.\"\n\nWe felt that he must be very interesting.\n\n\"He knows Mrs. Jellyby,\" said Mr. Jarndyce. \"He is a musical man, an\namateur, but might have been a professional. He is an artist too, an\namateur, but might have been a professional. He is a man of\nattainments and of captivating manners. He has been unfortunate in\nhis affairs, and unfortunate in his pursuits, and unfortunate in his\nfamily; but he don't care--he's a child!\"\n\n\"Did you imply that he has children of his own, sir?\" inquired\nRichard.\n\n\"Yes, Rick! Half-a-dozen. More! Nearer a dozen, I should think. But\nhe has never looked after them. How could he? He wanted somebody to\nlook after HIM. He is a child, you know!\" said Mr. Jarndyce.\n\n\"And have the children looked after themselves at all, sir?\" inquired\nRichard.\n\n\"Why, just as you may suppose,\" said Mr. Jarndyce, his countenance\nsuddenly falling. \"It is said that the children of the very poor are\nnot brought up, but dragged up. Harold Skimpole's children have\ntumbled up somehow or other. The wind's getting round again, I am\nafraid. I feel it rather!\"\n\nRichard observed that the situation was exposed on a sharp night.\n\n\"It IS exposed,\" said Mr. Jarndyce. \"No doubt that's the cause. Bleak\nHouse has an exposed sound. But you are coming my way. Come along!\"\n\nOur luggage having arrived and being all at hand, I was dressed in a\nfew minutes and engaged in putting my worldly goods away when a maid\n(not the one in attendance upon Ada, but another, whom I had not\nseen) brought a basket into my room with two bunches of keys in it,\nall labelled.\n\n\"For you, miss, if you please,\" said she.\n\n\"For me?\" said I.\n\n\"The housekeeping keys, miss.\"\n\nI showed my surprise, for she added with some little surprise on her\nown part, \"I was told to bring them as soon as you was alone, miss.\nMiss Summerson, if I don't deceive myself?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said I. \"That is my name.\"\n\n\"The large bunch is the housekeeping, and the little bunch is the\ncellars, miss. Any time you was pleased to appoint to-morrow morning,\nI was to show you the presses and things they belong to.\"\n\nI said I would be ready at half-past six, and after she was gone,\nstood looking at the basket, quite lost in the magnitude of my trust.\nAda found me thus and had such a delightful confidence in me when I\nshowed her the keys and told her about them that it would have been\ninsensibility and ingratitude not to feel encouraged. I knew, to be\nsure, that it was the dear girl's kindness, but I liked to be so\npleasantly cheated.\n\nWhen we went downstairs, we were presented to Mr. Skimpole, who was\nstanding before the fire telling Richard how fond he used to be, in\nhis school-time, of football. He was a little bright creature with a\nrather large head, but a delicate face and a sweet voice, and there\nwas a perfect charm in him. All he said was so free from effort and\nspontaneous and was said with such a captivating gaiety that it was\nfascinating to hear him talk. Being of a more slender figure than Mr.\nJarndyce and having a richer complexion, with browner hair, he looked\nyounger. Indeed, he had more the appearance in all respects of a\ndamaged young man than a well-preserved elderly one. There was an\neasy negligence in his manner and even in his dress (his hair\ncarelessly disposed, and his neckkerchief loose and flowing, as I\nhave seen artists paint their own portraits) which I could not\nseparate from the idea of a romantic youth who had undergone some\nunique process of depreciation. It struck me as being not at all like\nthe manner or appearance of a man who had advanced in life by the\nusual road of years, cares, and experiences.\n\nI gathered from the conversation that Mr. Skimpole had been educated\nfor the medical profession and had once lived, in his professional\ncapacity, in the household of a German prince. He told us, however,\nthat as he had always been a mere child in point of weights and\nmeasures and had never known anything about them (except that they\ndisgusted him), he had never been able to prescribe with the\nrequisite accuracy of detail. In fact, he said, he had no head for\ndetail. And he told us, with great humour, that when he was wanted to\nbleed the prince or physic any of his people, he was generally found\nlying on his back in bed, reading the newspapers or making\nfancy-sketches in pencil, and couldn't come. The prince, at last,\nobjecting to this, \"in which,\" said Mr. Skimpole, in the frankest\nmanner, \"he was perfectly right,\" the engagement terminated, and Mr.\nSkimpole having (as he added with delightful gaiety) \"nothing to live\nupon but love, fell in love, and married, and surrounded himself with\nrosy cheeks.\" His good friend Jarndyce and some other of his good\nfriends then helped him, in quicker or slower succession, to several\nopenings in life, but to no purpose, for he must confess to two of\nthe oldest infirmities in the world: one was that he had no idea of\ntime, the other that he had no idea of money. In consequence of which\nhe never kept an appointment, never could transact any business, and\nnever knew the value of anything! Well! So he had got on in life, and\nhere he was! He was very fond of reading the papers, very fond of\nmaking fancy-sketches with a pencil, very fond of nature, very fond\nof art. All he asked of society was to let him live. THAT wasn't\nmuch. His wants were few. Give him the papers, conversation, music,\nmutton, coffee, landscape, fruit in the season, a few sheets of\nBristol-board, and a little claret, and he asked no more. He was a\nmere child in the world, but he didn't cry for the moon. He said to\nthe world, \"Go your several ways in peace! Wear red coats, blue\ncoats, lawn sleeves; put pens behind your ears, wear aprons; go after\nglory, holiness, commerce, trade, any object you prefer; only--let\nHarold Skimpole live!\"\n\nAll this and a great deal more he told us, not only with the\nutmost brilliancy and enjoyment, but with a certain vivacious\ncandour--speaking of himself as if he were not at all his own affair,\nas if Skimpole were a third person, as if he knew that Skimpole had\nhis singularities but still had his claims too, which were the\ngeneral business of the community and must not be slighted. He was\nquite enchanting. If I felt at all confused at that early time in\nendeavouring to reconcile anything he said with anything I had\nthought about the duties and accountabilities of life (which I am far\nfrom sure of), I was confused by not exactly understanding why he was\nfree of them. That he WAS free of them, I scarcely doubted; he was so\nvery clear about it himself.\n\n\"I covet nothing,\" said Mr. Skimpole in the same light way.\n\"Possession is nothing to me. Here is my friend Jarndyce's excellent\nhouse. I feel obliged to him for possessing it. I can sketch it and\nalter it. I can set it to music. When I am here, I have sufficient\npossession of it and have neither trouble, cost, nor responsibility.\nMy steward's name, in short, is Jarndyce, and he can't cheat me. We\nhave been mentioning Mrs. Jellyby. There is a bright-eyed woman, of a\nstrong will and immense power of business detail, who throws herself\ninto objects with surprising ardour! I don't regret that I have not a\nstrong will and an immense power of business detail to throw myself\ninto objects with surprising ardour. I can admire her without envy. I\ncan sympathize with the objects. I can dream of them. I can lie down\non the grass--in fine weather--and float along an African river,\nembracing all the natives I meet, as sensible of the deep silence and\nsketching the dense overhanging tropical growth as accurately as if I\nwere there. I don't know that it's of any direct use my doing so, but\nit's all I can do, and I do it thoroughly. Then, for heaven's sake,\nhaving Harold Skimpole, a confiding child, petitioning you, the\nworld, an agglomeration of practical people of business habits, to\nlet him live and admire the human family, do it somehow or other,\nlike good souls, and suffer him to ride his rocking-horse!\"\n\nIt was plain enough that Mr. Jarndyce had not been neglectful of the\nadjuration. Mr. Skimpole's general position there would have rendered\nit so without the addition of what he presently said.\n\n\"It's only you, the generous creatures, whom I envy,\" said Mr.\nSkimpole, addressing us, his new friends, in an impersonal manner. \"I\nenvy you your power of doing what you do. It is what I should revel\nin myself. I don't feel any vulgar gratitude to you. I almost feel as\nif YOU ought to be grateful to ME for giving you the opportunity of\nenjoying the luxury of generosity. I know you like it. For anything I\ncan tell, I may have come into the world expressly for the purpose of\nincreasing your stock of happiness. I may have been born to be a\nbenefactor to you by sometimes giving you an opportunity of assisting\nme in my little perplexities. Why should I regret my incapacity for\ndetails and worldly affairs when it leads to such pleasant\nconsequences? I don't regret it therefore.\"\n\nOf all his playful speeches (playful, yet always fully meaning what\nthey expressed) none seemed to be more to the taste of Mr. Jarndyce\nthan this. I had often new temptations, afterwards, to wonder whether\nit was really singular, or only singular to me, that he, who was\nprobably the most grateful of mankind upon the least occasion, should\nso desire to escape the gratitude of others.\n\nWe were all enchanted. I felt it a merited tribute to the engaging\nqualities of Ada and Richard that Mr. Skimpole, seeing them for the\nfirst time, should be so unreserved and should lay himself out to be\nso exquisitely agreeable. They (and especially Richard) were\nnaturally pleased, for similar reasons, and considered it no common\nprivilege to be so freely confided in by such an attractive man. The\nmore we listened, the more gaily Mr. Skimpole talked. And what with\nhis fine hilarious manner and his engaging candour and his genial way\nof lightly tossing his own weaknesses about, as if he had said, \"I am\na child, you know! You are designing people compared with me\" (he\nreally made me consider myself in that light) \"but I am gay and\ninnocent; forget your worldly arts and play with me!\" the effect was\nabsolutely dazzling.\n\nHe was so full of feeling too and had such a delicate sentiment for\nwhat was beautiful or tender that he could have won a heart by that\nalone. In the evening, when I was preparing to make tea and Ada was\ntouching the piano in the adjoining room and softly humming a tune to\nher cousin Richard, which they had happened to mention, he came and\nsat down on the sofa near me and so spoke of Ada that I almost loved\nhim.\n\n\"She is like the morning,\" he said. \"With that golden hair, those\nblue eyes, and that fresh bloom on her cheek, she is like the summer\nmorning. The birds here will mistake her for it. We will not call\nsuch a lovely young creature as that, who is a joy to all mankind, an\norphan. She is the child of the universe.\"\n\nMr. Jarndyce, I found, was standing near us with his hands behind him\nand an attentive smile upon his face.\n\n\"The universe,\" he observed, \"makes rather an indifferent parent, I\nam afraid.\"\n\n\"Oh! I don't know!\" cried Mr. Skimpole buoyantly.\n\n\"I think I do know,\" said Mr. Jarndyce.\n\n\"Well!\" cried Mr. Skimpole. \"You know the world (which in your sense\nis the universe), and I know nothing of it, so you shall have your\nway. But if I had mine,\" glancing at the cousins, \"there should be no\nbrambles of sordid realities in such a path as that. It should be\nstrewn with roses; it should lie through bowers, where there was no\nspring, autumn, nor winter, but perpetual summer. Age or change\nshould never wither it. The base word money should never be breathed\nnear it!\"\n\nMr. Jarndyce patted him on the head with a smile, as if he had been\nreally a child, and passing a step or two on, and stopping a moment,\nglanced at the young cousins. His look was thoughtful, but had a\nbenignant expression in it which I often (how often!) saw again,\nwhich has long been engraven on my heart. The room in which they\nwere, communicating with that in which he stood, was only lighted by\nthe fire. Ada sat at the piano; Richard stood beside her, bending\ndown. Upon the wall, their shadows blended together, surrounded by\nstrange forms, not without a ghostly motion caught from the unsteady\nfire, though reflecting from motionless objects. Ada touched the\nnotes so softly and sang so low that the wind, sighing away to the\ndistant hills, was as audible as the music. The mystery of the future\nand the little clue afforded to it by the voice of the present seemed\nexpressed in the whole picture.\n\nBut it is not to recall this fancy, well as I remember it, that I\nrecall the scene. First, I was not quite unconscious of the contrast\nin respect of meaning and intention between the silent look directed\nthat way and the flow of words that had preceded it. Secondly, though\nMr. Jarndyce's glance as he withdrew it rested for but a moment on\nme, I felt as if in that moment he confided to me--and knew that he\nconfided to me and that I received the confidence--his hope that Ada\nand Richard might one day enter on a dearer relationship.\n\nMr. Skimpole could play on the piano and the violoncello, and he was\na composer--had composed half an opera once, but got tired of it--and\nplayed what he composed with taste. After tea we had quite a little\nconcert, in which Richard--who was enthralled by Ada's singing and\ntold me that she seemed to know all the songs that ever were\nwritten--and Mr. Jarndyce, and I were the audience. After a little\nwhile I missed first Mr. Skimpole and afterwards Richard, and while I\nwas thinking how could Richard stay away so long and lose so much,\nthe maid who had given me the keys looked in at the door, saying, \"If\nyou please, miss, could you spare a minute?\"\n\nWhen I was shut out with her in the hall, she said, holding up her\nhands, \"Oh, if you please, miss, Mr. Carstone says would you come\nupstairs to Mr. Skimpole's room. He has been took, miss!\"\n\n\"Took?\" said I.\n\n\"Took, miss. Sudden,\" said the maid.\n\nI was apprehensive that his illness might be of a dangerous kind, but\nof course I begged her to be quiet and not disturb any one and\ncollected myself, as I followed her quickly upstairs, sufficiently to\nconsider what were the best remedies to be applied if it should prove\nto be a fit. She threw open a door and I went into a chamber, where,\nto my unspeakable surprise, instead of finding Mr. Skimpole stretched\nupon the bed or prostrate on the floor, I found him standing before\nthe fire smiling at Richard, while Richard, with a face of great\nembarrassment, looked at a person on the sofa, in a white great-coat,\nwith smooth hair upon his head and not much of it, which he was\nwiping smoother and making less of with a pocket-handkerchief.\n\n\"Miss Summerson,\" said Richard hurriedly, \"I am glad you are come.\nYou will be able to advise us. Our friend Mr. Skimpole--don't be\nalarmed!--is arrested for debt.\"\n\n\"And really, my dear Miss Summerson,\" said Mr. Skimpole with his\nagreeable candour, \"I never was in a situation in which that\nexcellent sense and quiet habit of method and usefulness, which\nanybody must observe in you who has the happiness of being a quarter\nof an hour in your society, was more needed.\"\n\nThe person on the sofa, who appeared to have a cold in his head, gave\nsuch a very loud snort that he startled me.\n\n\"Are you arrested for much, sir?\" I inquired of Mr. Skimpole.\n\n\"My dear Miss Summerson,\" said he, shaking his head pleasantly, \"I\ndon't know. Some pounds, odd shillings, and halfpence, I think, were\nmentioned.\"\n\n\"It's twenty-four pound, sixteen, and sevenpence ha'penny,\" observed\nthe stranger. \"That's wot it is.\"\n\n\"And it sounds--somehow it sounds,\" said Mr. Skimpole, \"like a small\nsum?\"\n\nThe strange man said nothing but made another snort. It was such a\npowerful one that it seemed quite to lift him out of his seat.\n\n\"Mr. Skimpole,\" said Richard to me, \"has a delicacy in applying to my\ncousin Jarndyce because he has lately--I think, sir, I understood you\nthat you had lately--\"\n\n\"Oh, yes!\" returned Mr. Skimpole, smiling. \"Though I forgot how much\nit was and when it was. Jarndyce would readily do it again, but I\nhave the epicure-like feeling that I would prefer a novelty in help,\nthat I would rather,\" and he looked at Richard and me, \"develop\ngenerosity in a new soil and in a new form of flower.\"\n\n\"What do you think will be best, Miss Summerson?\" said Richard,\naside.\n\nI ventured to inquire, generally, before replying, what would happen\nif the money were not produced.\n\n\"Jail,\" said the strange man, coolly putting his handkerchief into\nhis hat, which was on the floor at his feet. \"Or Coavinses.\"\n\n\"May I ask, sir, what is--\"\n\n\"Coavinses?\" said the strange man. \"A 'ouse.\"\n\nRichard and I looked at one another again. It was a most singular\nthing that the arrest was our embarrassment and not Mr. Skimpole's.\nHe observed us with a genial interest, but there seemed, if I may\nventure on such a contradiction, nothing selfish in it. He had\nentirely washed his hands of the difficulty, and it had become ours.\n\n\"I thought,\" he suggested, as if good-naturedly to help us out, \"that\nbeing parties in a Chancery suit concerning (as people say) a large\namount of property, Mr. Richard or his beautiful cousin, or both,\ncould sign something, or make over something, or give some sort of\nundertaking, or pledge, or bond? I don't know what the business name\nof it may be, but I suppose there is some instrument within their\npower that would settle this?\"\n\n\"Not a bit on it,\" said the strange man.\n\n\"Really?\" returned Mr. Skimpole. \"That seems odd, now, to one who is\nno judge of these things!\"\n\n\"Odd or even,\" said the stranger gruffly, \"I tell you, not a bit on\nit!\"\n\n\"Keep your temper, my good fellow, keep your temper!\" Mr. Skimpole\ngently reasoned with him as he made a little drawing of his head on\nthe fly-leaf of a book. \"Don't be ruffled by your occupation. We can\nseparate you from your office; we can separate the individual from\nthe pursuit. We are not so prejudiced as to suppose that in private\nlife you are otherwise than a very estimable man, with a great deal\nof poetry in your nature, of which you may not be conscious.\"\n\nThe stranger only answered with another violent snort, whether in\nacceptance of the poetry-tribute or in disdainful rejection of it, he\ndid not express to me.\n\n\"Now, my dear Miss Summerson, and my dear Mr. Richard,\" said Mr.\nSkimpole gaily, innocently, and confidingly as he looked at his\ndrawing with his head on one side, \"here you see me utterly incapable\nof helping myself, and entirely in your hands! I only ask to be free.\nThe butterflies are free. Mankind will surely not deny to Harold\nSkimpole what it concedes to the butterflies!\"\n\n\"My dear Miss Summerson,\" said Richard in a whisper, \"I have ten\npounds that I received from Mr. Kenge. I must try what that will do.\"\n\nI possessed fifteen pounds, odd shillings, which I had saved from my\nquarterly allowance during several years. I had always thought that\nsome accident might happen which would throw me suddenly, without any\nrelation or any property, on the world and had always tried to keep\nsome little money by me that I might not be quite penniless. I told\nRichard of my having this little store and having no present need of\nit, and I asked him delicately to inform Mr. Skimpole, while I should\nbe gone to fetch it, that we would have the pleasure of paying his\ndebt.\n\nWhen I came back, Mr. Skimpole kissed my hand and seemed quite\ntouched. Not on his own account (I was again aware of that perplexing\nand extraordinary contradiction), but on ours, as if personal\nconsiderations were impossible with him and the contemplation of our\nhappiness alone affected him. Richard, begging me, for the greater\ngrace of the transaction, as he said, to settle with Coavinses (as\nMr. Skimpole now jocularly called him), I counted out the money and\nreceived the necessary acknowledgment. This, too, delighted Mr.\nSkimpole.\n\nHis compliments were so delicately administered that I blushed less\nthan I might have done and settled with the stranger in the white\ncoat without making any mistakes. He put the money in his pocket and\nshortly said, \"Well, then, I'll wish you a good evening, miss.\n\n\"My friend,\" said Mr. Skimpole, standing with his back to the fire\nafter giving up the sketch when it was half finished, \"I should like\nto ask you something, without offence.\"\n\nI think the reply was, \"Cut away, then!\"\n\n\"Did you know this morning, now, that you were coming out on this\nerrand?\" said Mr. Skimpole.\n\n\"Know'd it yes'day aft'noon at tea-time,\" said Coavinses.\n\n\"It didn't affect your appetite? Didn't make you at all uneasy?\"\n\n\"Not a bit,\" said Coavinses. \"I know'd if you wos missed to-day, you\nwouldn't be missed to-morrow. A day makes no such odds.\"\n\n\"But when you came down here,\" proceeded Mr. Skimpole, \"it was a fine\nday. The sun was shining, the wind was blowing, the lights and\nshadows were passing across the fields, the birds were singing.\"\n\n\"Nobody said they warn't, in MY hearing,\" returned Coavinses.\n\n\"No,\" observed Mr. Skimpole. \"But what did you think upon the road?\"\n\n\"Wot do you mean?\" growled Coavinses with an appearance of strong\nresentment. \"Think! I've got enough to do, and little enough to get\nfor it without thinking. Thinking!\" (with profound contempt).\n\n\"Then you didn't think, at all events,\" proceeded Mr. Skimpole, \"to\nthis effect: 'Harold Skimpole loves to see the sun shine, loves to\nhear the wind blow, loves to watch the changing lights and shadows,\nloves to hear the birds, those choristers in Nature's great\ncathedral. And does it seem to me that I am about to deprive Harold\nSkimpole of his share in such possessions, which are his only\nbirthright!' You thought nothing to that effect?\"\n\n\"I--certainly--did--NOT,\" said Coavinses, whose doggedness in utterly\nrenouncing the idea was of that intense kind that he could only give\nadequate expression to it by putting a long interval between each\nword, and accompanying the last with a jerk that might have\ndislocated his neck.\n\n\"Very odd and very curious, the mental process is, in you men of\nbusiness!\" said Mr. Skimpole thoughtfully. \"Thank you, my friend.\nGood night.\"\n\nAs our absence had been long enough already to seem strange\ndownstairs, I returned at once and found Ada sitting at work by the\nfireside talking to her cousin John. Mr. Skimpole presently appeared,\nand Richard shortly after him. I was sufficiently engaged during the\nremainder of the evening in taking my first lesson in backgammon from\nMr. Jarndyce, who was very fond of the game and from whom I wished of\ncourse to learn it as quickly as I could in order that I might be of\nthe very small use of being able to play when he had no better\nadversary. But I thought, occasionally, when Mr. Skimpole played some\nfragments of his own compositions or when, both at the piano and the\nvioloncello, and at our table, he preserved with an absence of all\neffort his delightful spirits and his easy flow of conversation, that\nRichard and I seemed to retain the transferred impression of having\nbeen arrested since dinner and that it was very curious altogether.\n\nIt was late before we separated, for when Ada was going at eleven\no'clock, Mr. Skimpole went to the piano and rattled hilariously that\nthe best of all ways to lengthen our days was to steal a few hours\nfrom night, my dear! It was past twelve before he took his candle and\nhis radiant face out of the room, and I think he might have kept us\nthere, if he had seen fit, until daybreak. Ada and Richard were\nlingering for a few moments by the fire, wondering whether Mrs.\nJellyby had yet finished her dictation for the day, when Mr.\nJarndyce, who had been out of the room, returned.\n\n\"Oh, dear me, what's this, what's this!\" he said, rubbing his head\nand walking about with his good-humoured vexation. \"What's this they\ntell me? Rick, my boy, Esther, my dear, what have you been doing? Why\ndid you do it? How could you do it? How much apiece was it? The\nwind's round again. I feel it all over me!\"\n\nWe neither of us quite knew what to answer.\n\n\"Come, Rick, come! I must settle this before I sleep. How much are\nyou out of pocket? You two made the money up, you know! Why did you?\nHow could you? Oh, Lord, yes, it's due east--must be!\"\n\n\"Really, sir,\" said Richard, \"I don't think it would be honourable in\nme to tell you. Mr. Skimpole relied upon us--\"\n\n\"Lord bless you, my dear boy! He relies upon everybody!\" said Mr.\nJarndyce, giving his head a great rub and stopping short.\n\n\"Indeed, sir?\"\n\n\"Everybody! And he'll be in the same scrape again next week!\" said\nMr. Jarndyce, walking again at a great pace, with a candle in his\nhand that had gone out. \"He's always in the same scrape. He was born\nin the same scrape. I verily believe that the announcement in the\nnewspapers when his mother was confined was 'On Tuesday last, at her\nresidence in Botheration Buildings, Mrs. Skimpole of a son in\ndifficulties.'\"\n\nRichard laughed heartily but added, \"Still, sir, I don't want to\nshake his confidence or to break his confidence, and if I submit to\nyour better knowledge again, that I ought to keep his secret, I hope\nyou will consider before you press me any more. Of course, if you do\npress me, sir, I shall know I am wrong and will tell you.\"\n\n\"Well!\" cried Mr. Jarndyce, stopping again, and making several absent\nendeavours to put his candlestick in his pocket. \"I--here! Take it\naway, my dear. I don't know what I am about with it; it's all the\nwind--invariably has that effect--I won't press you, Rick; you may be\nright. But really--to get hold of you and Esther--and to squeeze you\nlike a couple of tender young Saint Michael's oranges! It'll blow a\ngale in the course of the night!\"\n\nHe was now alternately putting his hands into his pockets as if he\nwere going to keep them there a long time, and taking them out again\nand vehemently rubbing them all over his head.\n\nI ventured to take this opportunity of hinting that Mr. Skimpole,\nbeing in all such matters quite a child--\n\n\"Eh, my dear?\" said Mr. Jarndyce, catching at the word.\n\n\"Being quite a child, sir,\" said I, \"and so different from other\npeople--\"\n\n\"You are right!\" said Mr. Jarndyce, brightening. \"Your woman's wit\nhits the mark. He is a child--an absolute child. I told you he was a\nchild, you know, when I first mentioned him.\"\n\nCertainly! Certainly! we said.\n\n\"And he IS a child. Now, isn't he?\" asked Mr. Jarndyce, brightening\nmore and more.\n\nHe was indeed, we said.\n\n\"When you come to think of it, it's the height of childishness in\nyou--I mean me--\" said Mr. Jarndyce, \"to regard him for a moment as a\nman. You can't make HIM responsible. The idea of Harold Skimpole with\ndesigns or plans, or knowledge of consequences! Ha, ha, ha!\"\n\nIt was so delicious to see the clouds about his bright face clearing,\nand to see him so heartily pleased, and to know, as it was impossible\nnot to know, that the source of his pleasure was the goodness which\nwas tortured by condemning, or mistrusting, or secretly accusing any\none, that I saw the tears in Ada's eyes, while she echoed his laugh,\nand felt them in my own.\n\n\"Why, what a cod's head and shoulders I am,\" said Mr. Jarndyce, \"to\nrequire reminding of it! The whole business shows the child from\nbeginning to end. Nobody but a child would have thought of singling\nYOU two out for parties in the affair! Nobody but a child would have\nthought of YOUR having the money! If it had been a thousand pounds,\nit would have been just the same!\" said Mr. Jarndyce with his whole\nface in a glow.\n\nWe all confirmed it from our night's experience.\n\n\"To be sure, to be sure!\" said Mr. Jarndyce. \"However, Rick, Esther,\nand you too, Ada, for I don't know that even your little purse is\nsafe from his inexperience--I must have a promise all round that\nnothing of this sort shall ever be done any more. No advances! Not\neven sixpences.\"\n\nWe all promised faithfully, Richard with a merry glance at me\ntouching his pocket as if to remind me that there was no danger of\nOUR transgressing.\n\n\"As to Skimpole,\" said Mr. Jarndyce, \"a habitable doll's house with\ngood board and a few tin people to get into debt with and borrow\nmoney of would set the boy up in life. He is in a child's sleep by\nthis time, I suppose; it's time I should take my craftier head to my\nmore worldly pillow. Good night, my dears. God bless you!\"\n\nHe peeped in again, with a smiling face, before we had lighted our\ncandles, and said, \"Oh! I have been looking at the weather-cock. I\nfind it was a false alarm about the wind. It's in the south!\" And\nwent away singing to himself.\n\nAda and I agreed, as we talked together for a little while upstairs,\nthat this caprice about the wind was a fiction and that he used the\npretence to account for any disappointment he could not conceal,\nrather than he would blame the real cause of it or disparage or\ndepreciate any one. We thought this very characteristic of his\neccentric gentleness and of the difference between him and those\npetulant people who make the weather and the winds (particularly that\nunlucky wind which he had chosen for such a different purpose) the\nstalking-horses of their splenetic and gloomy humours.\n\nIndeed, so much affection for him had been added in this one evening\nto my gratitude that I hoped I already began to understand him\nthrough that mingled feeling. Any seeming inconsistencies in Mr.\nSkimpole or in Mrs. Jellyby I could not expect to be able to\nreconcile, having so little experience or practical knowledge.\nNeither did I try, for my thoughts were busy when I was alone, with\nAda and Richard and with the confidence I had seemed to receive\nconcerning them. My fancy, made a little wild by the wind perhaps,\nwould not consent to be all unselfish, either, though I would have\npersuaded it to be so if I could. It wandered back to my godmother's\nhouse and came along the intervening track, raising up shadowy\nspeculations which had sometimes trembled there in the dark as to\nwhat knowledge Mr. Jarndyce had of my earliest history--even as to\nthe possibility of his being my father, though that idle dream was\nquite gone now.\n\nIt was all gone now, I remembered, getting up from the fire. It was\nnot for me to muse over bygones, but to act with a cheerful spirit\nand a grateful heart. So I said to myself, \"Esther, Esther, Esther!\nDuty, my dear!\" and gave my little basket of housekeeping keys such a\nshake that they sounded like little bells and rang me hopefully to\nbed.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII\n\nThe Ghost's Walk\n\n\nWhile Esther sleeps, and while Esther wakes, it is still wet weather\ndown at the place in Lincolnshire. The rain is ever falling--drip,\ndrip, drip--by day and night upon the broad flagged terrace-pavement,\nthe Ghost's Walk. The weather is so very bad down in Lincolnshire\nthat the liveliest imagination can scarcely apprehend its ever being\nfine again. Not that there is any superabundant life of imagination\non the spot, for Sir Leicester is not here (and, truly, even if he\nwere, would not do much for it in that particular), but is in Paris\nwith my Lady; and solitude, with dusky wings, sits brooding upon\nChesney Wold.\n\nThere may be some motions of fancy among the lower animals at Chesney\nWold. The horses in the stables--the long stables in a barren,\nred-brick court-yard, where there is a great bell in a turret, and a\nclock with a large face, which the pigeons who live near it and who\nlove to perch upon its shoulders seem to be always consulting--THEY\nmay contemplate some mental pictures of fine weather on occasions,\nand may be better artists at them than the grooms. The old roan, so\nfamous for cross-country work, turning his large eyeball to the\ngrated window near his rack, may remember the fresh leaves that\nglisten there at other times and the scents that stream in, and may\nhave a fine run with the hounds, while the human helper, clearing out\nthe next stall, never stirs beyond his pitchfork and birch-broom. The\ngrey, whose place is opposite the door and who with an impatient\nrattle of his halter pricks his ears and turns his head so wistfully\nwhen it is opened, and to whom the opener says, \"Woa grey, then,\nsteady! Noabody wants you to-day!\" may know it quite as well as the\nman. The whole seemingly monotonous and uncompanionable half-dozen,\nstabled together, may pass the long wet hours when the door is shut\nin livelier communication than is held in the servants' hall or at\nthe Dedlock Arms, or may even beguile the time by improving (perhaps\ncorrupting) the pony in the loose-box in the corner.\n\nSo the mastiff, dozing in his kennel in the court-yard with his large\nhead on his paws, may think of the hot sunshine when the shadows of\nthe stable-buildings tire his patience out by changing and leave him\nat one time of the day no broader refuge than the shadow of his own\nhouse, where he sits on end, panting and growling short, and very\nmuch wanting something to worry besides himself and his chain. So\nnow, half-waking and all-winking, he may recall the house full of\ncompany, the coach-houses full of vehicles, the stables full of\nhorses, and the out-buildings full of attendants upon horses, until\nhe is undecided about the present and comes forth to see how it is.\nThen, with that impatient shake of himself, he may growl in the\nspirit, \"Rain, rain, rain! Nothing but rain--and no family here!\" as\nhe goes in again and lies down with a gloomy yawn.\n\nSo with the dogs in the kennel-buildings across the park, who have\ntheir restless fits and whose doleful voices when the wind has been\nvery obstinate have even made it known in the house itself--upstairs,\ndownstairs, and in my Lady's chamber. They may hunt the whole\ncountry-side, while the raindrops are pattering round their\ninactivity. So the rabbits with their self-betraying tails, frisking\nin and out of holes at roots of trees, may be lively with ideas of\nthe breezy days when their ears are blown about or of those seasons\nof interest when there are sweet young plants to gnaw. The turkey in\nthe poultry-yard, always troubled with a class-grievance (probably\nChristmas), may be reminiscent of that summer morning wrongfully\ntaken from him when he got into the lane among the felled trees,\nwhere there was a barn and barley. The discontented goose, who stoops\nto pass under the old gateway, twenty feet high, may gabble out, if\nwe only knew it, a waddling preference for weather when the gateway\ncasts its shadow on the ground.\n\nBe this as it may, there is not much fancy otherwise stirring at\nChesney Wold. If there be a little at any odd moment, it goes, like a\nlittle noise in that old echoing place, a long way and usually leads\noff to ghosts and mystery.\n\nIt has rained so hard and rained so long down in Lincolnshire that\nMrs. Rouncewell, the old housekeeper at Chesney Wold, has several\ntimes taken off her spectacles and cleaned them to make certain that\nthe drops were not upon the glasses. Mrs. Rouncewell might have been\nsufficiently assured by hearing the rain, but that she is rather\ndeaf, which nothing will induce her to believe. She is a fine old\nlady, handsome, stately, wonderfully neat, and has such a back and\nsuch a stomacher that if her stays should turn out when she dies to\nhave been a broad old-fashioned family fire-grate, nobody who knows\nher would have cause to be surprised. Weather affects Mrs. Rouncewell\nlittle. The house is there in all weathers, and the house, as she\nexpresses it, \"is what she looks at.\" She sits in her room (in a side\npassage on the ground floor, with an arched window commanding a\nsmooth quadrangle, adorned at regular intervals with smooth round\ntrees and smooth round blocks of stone, as if the trees were going to\nplay at bowls with the stones), and the whole house reposes on her\nmind. She can open it on occasion and be busy and fluttered, but it\nis shut up now and lies on the breadth of Mrs. Rouncewell's\niron-bound bosom in a majestic sleep.\n\nIt is the next difficult thing to an impossibility to imagine Chesney\nWold without Mrs. Rouncewell, but she has only been here fifty years.\nAsk her how long, this rainy day, and she shall answer \"fifty year,\nthree months, and a fortnight, by the blessing of heaven, if I live\ntill Tuesday.\" Mr. Rouncewell died some time before the decease of\nthe pretty fashion of pig-tails, and modestly hid his own (if he took\nit with him) in a corner of the churchyard in the park near the\nmouldy porch. He was born in the market-town, and so was his young\nwidow. Her progress in the family began in the time of the last Sir\nLeicester and originated in the still-room.\n\nThe present representative of the Dedlocks is an excellent master. He\nsupposes all his dependents to be utterly bereft of individual\ncharacters, intentions, or opinions, and is persuaded that he was\nborn to supersede the necessity of their having any. If he were to\nmake a discovery to the contrary, he would be simply stunned--would\nnever recover himself, most likely, except to gasp and die. But he is\nan excellent master still, holding it a part of his state to be so.\nHe has a great liking for Mrs. Rouncewell; he says she is a most\nrespectable, creditable woman. He always shakes hands with her when\nhe comes down to Chesney Wold and when he goes away; and if he were\nvery ill, or if he were knocked down by accident, or run over, or\nplaced in any situation expressive of a Dedlock at a disadvantage, he\nwould say if he could speak, \"Leave me, and send Mrs. Rouncewell\nhere!\" feeling his dignity, at such a pass, safer with her than with\nanybody else.\n\nMrs. Rouncewell has known trouble. She has had two sons, of whom the\nyounger ran wild, and went for a soldier, and never came back. Even\nto this hour, Mrs. Rouncewell's calm hands lose their composure when\nshe speaks of him, and unfolding themselves from her stomacher, hover\nabout her in an agitated manner as she says what a likely lad, what a\nfine lad, what a gay, good-humoured, clever lad he was! Her second\nson would have been provided for at Chesney Wold and would have been\nmade steward in due season, but he took, when he was a schoolboy, to\nconstructing steam-engines out of saucepans and setting birds to draw\ntheir own water with the least possible amount of labour, so\nassisting them with artful contrivance of hydraulic pressure that a\nthirsty canary had only, in a literal sense, to put his shoulder to\nthe wheel and the job was done. This propensity gave Mrs. Rouncewell\ngreat uneasiness. She felt it with a mother's anguish to be a move in\nthe Wat Tyler direction, well knowing that Sir Leicester had that\ngeneral impression of an aptitude for any art to which smoke and a\ntall chimney might be considered essential. But the doomed young\nrebel (otherwise a mild youth, and very persevering), showing no sign\nof grace as he got older but, on the contrary, constructing a model\nof a power-loom, she was fain, with many tears, to mention his\nbackslidings to the baronet. \"Mrs. Rouncewell,\" said Sir Leicester,\n\"I can never consent to argue, as you know, with any one on any\nsubject. You had better get rid of your boy; you had better get him\ninto some Works. The iron country farther north is, I suppose, the\ncongenial direction for a boy with these tendencies.\" Farther north\nhe went, and farther north he grew up; and if Sir Leicester Dedlock\never saw him when he came to Chesney Wold to visit his mother, or\never thought of him afterwards, it is certain that he only regarded\nhim as one of a body of some odd thousand conspirators, swarthy and\ngrim, who were in the habit of turning out by torchlight two or three\nnights in the week for unlawful purposes.\n\nNevertheless, Mrs. Rouncewell's son has, in the course of nature and\nart, grown up, and established himself, and married, and called unto\nhim Mrs. Rouncewell's grandson, who, being out of his apprenticeship,\nand home from a journey in far countries, whither he was sent to\nenlarge his knowledge and complete his preparations for the venture\nof this life, stands leaning against the chimney-piece this very day\nin Mrs. Rouncewell's room at Chesney Wold.\n\n\"And, again and again, I am glad to see you, Watt! And, once again, I\nam glad to see you, Watt!\" says Mrs. Rouncewell. \"You are a fine\nyoung fellow. You are like your poor uncle George. Ah!\" Mrs.\nRouncewell's hands unquiet, as usual, on this reference.\n\n\"They say I am like my father, grandmother.\"\n\n\"Like him, also, my dear--but most like your poor uncle George! And\nyour dear father.\" Mrs. Rouncewell folds her hands again. \"He is\nwell?\"\n\n\"Thriving, grandmother, in every way.\"\n\n\"I am thankful!\" Mrs. Rouncewell is fond of her son but has a\nplaintive feeling towards him, much as if he were a very honourable\nsoldier who had gone over to the enemy.\n\n\"He is quite happy?\" says she.\n\n\"Quite.\"\n\n\"I am thankful! So he has brought you up to follow in his ways and\nhas sent you into foreign countries and the like? Well, he knows\nbest. There may be a world beyond Chesney Wold that I don't\nunderstand. Though I am not young, either. And I have seen a quantity\nof good company too!\"\n\n\"Grandmother,\" says the young man, changing the subject, \"what a very\npretty girl that was I found with you just now. You called her Rosa?\"\n\n\"Yes, child. She is daughter of a widow in the village. Maids are so\nhard to teach, now-a-days, that I have put her about me young. She's\nan apt scholar and will do well. She shows the house already, very\npretty. She lives with me at my table here.\"\n\n\"I hope I have not driven her away?\"\n\n\"She supposes we have family affairs to speak about, I dare say. She\nis very modest. It is a fine quality in a young woman. And scarcer,\"\nsays Mrs. Rouncewell, expanding her stomacher to its utmost limits,\n\"than it formerly was!\"\n\nThe young man inclines his head in acknowledgment of the precepts of\nexperience. Mrs. Rouncewell listens.\n\n\"Wheels!\" says she. They have long been audible to the younger ears\nof her companion. \"What wheels on such a day as this, for gracious\nsake?\"\n\nAfter a short interval, a tap at the door. \"Come in!\" A dark-eyed,\ndark-haired, shy, village beauty comes in--so fresh in her rosy and\nyet delicate bloom that the drops of rain which have beaten on her\nhair look like the dew upon a flower fresh gathered.\n\n\"What company is this, Rosa?\" says Mrs. Rouncewell.\n\n\"It's two young men in a gig, ma'am, who want to see the house--yes,\nand if you please, I told them so!\" in quick reply to a gesture of\ndissent from the housekeeper. \"I went to the hall-door and told them\nit was the wrong day and the wrong hour, but the young man who was\ndriving took off his hat in the wet and begged me to bring this card\nto you.\"\n\n\"Read it, my dear Watt,\" says the housekeeper.\n\nRosa is so shy as she gives it to him that they drop it between them\nand almost knock their foreheads together as they pick it up. Rosa is\nshyer than before.\n\n\"Mr. Guppy\" is all the information the card yields.\n\n\"Guppy!\" repeats Mrs. Rouncewell, \"MR. Guppy! Nonsense, I never heard\nof him!\"\n\n\"If you please, he told ME that!\" says Rosa. \"But he said that he and\nthe other young gentleman came from London only last night by the\nmail, on business at the magistrates' meeting, ten miles off, this\nmorning, and that as their business was soon over, and they had heard\na great deal said of Chesney Wold, and really didn't know what to do\nwith themselves, they had come through the wet to see it. They are\nlawyers. He says he is not in Mr. Tulkinghorn's office, but he is\nsure he may make use of Mr. Tulkinghorn's name if necessary.\"\nFinding, now she leaves off, that she has been making quite a long\nspeech, Rosa is shyer than ever.\n\nNow, Mr. Tulkinghorn is, in a manner, part and parcel of the place,\nand besides, is supposed to have made Mrs. Rouncewell's will. The old\nlady relaxes, consents to the admission of the visitors as a favour,\nand dismisses Rosa. The grandson, however, being smitten by a sudden\nwish to see the house himself, proposes to join the party. The\ngrandmother, who is pleased that he should have that interest,\naccompanies him--though to do him justice, he is exceedingly\nunwilling to trouble her.\n\n\"Much obliged to you, ma'am!\" says Mr. Guppy, divesting himself of\nhis wet dreadnought in the hall. \"Us London lawyers don't often get\nan out, and when we do, we like to make the most of it, you know.\"\n\nThe old housekeeper, with a gracious severity of deportment, waves\nher hand towards the great staircase. Mr. Guppy and his friend follow\nRosa; Mrs. Rouncewell and her grandson follow them; a young gardener\ngoes before to open the shutters.\n\nAs is usually the case with people who go over houses, Mr. Guppy and\nhis friend are dead beat before they have well begun. They straggle\nabout in wrong places, look at wrong things, don't care for the right\nthings, gape when more rooms are opened, exhibit profound depression\nof spirits, and are clearly knocked up. In each successive chamber\nthat they enter, Mrs. Rouncewell, who is as upright as the house\nitself, rests apart in a window-seat or other such nook and listens\nwith stately approval to Rosa's exposition. Her grandson is so\nattentive to it that Rosa is shyer than ever--and prettier. Thus they\npass on from room to room, raising the pictured Dedlocks for a few\nbrief minutes as the young gardener admits the light, and\nreconsigning them to their graves as he shuts it out again. It\nappears to the afflicted Mr. Guppy and his inconsolable friend that\nthere is no end to the Dedlocks, whose family greatness seems to\nconsist in their never having done anything to distinguish themselves\nfor seven hundred years.\n\nEven the long drawing-room of Chesney Wold cannot revive Mr. Guppy's\nspirits. He is so low that he droops on the threshold and has hardly\nstrength of mind to enter. But a portrait over the chimney-piece,\npainted by the fashionable artist of the day, acts upon him like a\ncharm. He recovers in a moment. He stares at it with uncommon\ninterest; he seems to be fixed and fascinated by it.\n\n\"Dear me!\" says Mr. Guppy. \"Who's that?\"\n\n\"The picture over the fire-place,\" says Rosa, \"is the portrait of the\npresent Lady Dedlock. It is considered a perfect likeness, and the\nbest work of the master.\"\n\n\"Blest,\" says Mr. Guppy, staring in a kind of dismay at his friend,\n\"if I can ever have seen her. Yet I know her! Has the picture been\nengraved, miss?\"\n\n\"The picture has never been engraved. Sir Leicester has always\nrefused permission.\"\n\n\"Well!\" says Mr. Guppy in a low voice. \"I'll be shot if it ain't very\ncurious how well I know that picture! So that's Lady Dedlock, is it!\"\n\n\"The picture on the right is the present Sir Leicester Dedlock. The\npicture on the left is his father, the late Sir Leicester.\"\n\nMr. Guppy has no eyes for either of these magnates. \"It's\nunaccountable to me,\" he says, still staring at the portrait, \"how\nwell I know that picture! I'm dashed,\" adds Mr. Guppy, looking round,\n\"if I don't think I must have had a dream of that picture, you know!\"\n\nAs no one present takes any especial interest in Mr. Guppy's dreams,\nthe probability is not pursued. But he still remains so absorbed by\nthe portrait that he stands immovable before it until the young\ngardener has closed the shutters, when he comes out of the room in a\ndazed state that is an odd though a sufficient substitute for\ninterest and follows into the succeeding rooms with a confused stare,\nas if he were looking everywhere for Lady Dedlock again.\n\nHe sees no more of her. He sees her rooms, which are the last shown,\nas being very elegant, and he looks out of the windows from which she\nlooked out, not long ago, upon the weather that bored her to death.\nAll things have an end, even houses that people take infinite pains\nto see and are tired of before they begin to see them. He has come to\nthe end of the sight, and the fresh village beauty to the end of her\ndescription; which is always this: \"The terrace below is much\nadmired. It is called, from an old story in the family, the Ghost's\nWalk.\"\n\n\"No?\" says Mr. Guppy, greedily curious. \"What's the story, miss? Is\nit anything about a picture?\"\n\n\"Pray tell us the story,\" says Watt in a half whisper.\n\n\"I don't know it, sir.\" Rosa is shyer than ever.\n\n\"It is not related to visitors; it is almost forgotten,\" says the\nhousekeeper, advancing. \"It has never been more than a family\nanecdote.\"\n\n\"You'll excuse my asking again if it has anything to do with a\npicture, ma'am,\" observes Mr. Guppy, \"because I do assure you that\nthe more I think of that picture the better I know it, without\nknowing how I know it!\"\n\nThe story has nothing to do with a picture; the housekeeper can\nguarantee that. Mr. Guppy is obliged to her for the information and\nis, moreover, generally obliged. He retires with his friend, guided\ndown another staircase by the young gardener, and presently is heard\nto drive away. It is now dusk. Mrs. Rouncewell can trust to the\ndiscretion of her two young hearers and may tell THEM how the terrace\ncame to have that ghostly name.\n\nShe seats herself in a large chair by the fast-darkening window and\ntells them: \"In the wicked days, my dears, of King Charles the\nFirst--I mean, of course, in the wicked days of the rebels who\nleagued themselves against that excellent king--Sir Morbury Dedlock\nwas the owner of Chesney Wold. Whether there was any account of a\nghost in the family before those days, I can't say. I should think it\nvery likely indeed.\"\n\nMrs. Rouncewell holds this opinion because she considers that a\nfamily of such antiquity and importance has a right to a ghost. She\nregards a ghost as one of the privileges of the upper classes, a\ngenteel distinction to which the common people have no claim.\n\n\"Sir Morbury Dedlock,\" says Mrs. Rouncewell, \"was, I have no occasion\nto say, on the side of the blessed martyr. But it IS supposed that\nhis Lady, who had none of the family blood in her veins, favoured the\nbad cause. It is said that she had relations among King Charles's\nenemies, that she was in correspondence with them, and that she gave\nthem information. When any of the country gentlemen who followed his\nMajesty's cause met here, it is said that my Lady was always nearer\nto the door of their council-room than they supposed. Do you hear a\nsound like a footstep passing along the terrace, Watt?\"\n\nRosa draws nearer to the housekeeper.\n\n\"I hear the rain-drip on the stones,\" replies the young man, \"and I\nhear a curious echo--I suppose an echo--which is very like a halting\nstep.\"\n\nThe housekeeper gravely nods and continues: \"Partly on account of\nthis division between them, and partly on other accounts, Sir Morbury\nand his Lady led a troubled life. She was a lady of a haughty temper.\nThey were not well suited to each other in age or character, and they\nhad no children to moderate between them. After her favourite\nbrother, a young gentleman, was killed in the civil wars (by Sir\nMorbury's near kinsman), her feeling was so violent that she hated\nthe race into which she had married. When the Dedlocks were about to\nride out from Chesney Wold in the king's cause, she is supposed to\nhave more than once stolen down into the stables in the dead of night\nand lamed their horses; and the story is that once at such an hour,\nher husband saw her gliding down the stairs and followed her into the\nstall where his own favourite horse stood. There he seized her by the\nwrist, and in a struggle or in a fall or through the horse being\nfrightened and lashing out, she was lamed in the hip and from that\nhour began to pine away.\"\n\nThe housekeeper has dropped her voice to a little more than a\nwhisper.\n\n\"She had been a lady of a handsome figure and a noble carriage. She\nnever complained of the change; she never spoke to any one of being\ncrippled or of being in pain, but day by day she tried to walk upon\nthe terrace, and with the help of the stone balustrade, went up and\ndown, up and down, up and down, in sun and shadow, with greater\ndifficulty every day. At last, one afternoon her husband (to whom she\nhad never, on any persuasion, opened her lips since that night),\nstanding at the great south window, saw her drop upon the pavement.\nHe hastened down to raise her, but she repulsed him as he bent over\nher, and looking at him fixedly and coldly, said, 'I will die here\nwhere I have walked. And I will walk here, though I am in my grave. I\nwill walk here until the pride of this house is humbled. And when\ncalamity or when disgrace is coming to it, let the Dedlocks listen\nfor my step!'\"\n\nWatt looks at Rosa. Rosa in the deepening gloom looks down upon the\nground, half frightened and half shy.\n\n\"There and then she died. And from those days,\" says Mrs. Rouncewell,\n\"the name has come down--the Ghost's Walk. If the tread is an echo,\nit is an echo that is only heard after dark, and is often unheard for\na long while together. But it comes back from time to time; and so\nsure as there is sickness or death in the family, it will be heard\nthen.\"\n\n\"And disgrace, grandmother--\" says Watt.\n\n\"Disgrace never comes to Chesney Wold,\" returns the housekeeper.\n\nHer grandson apologizes with \"True. True.\"\n\n\"That is the story. Whatever the sound is, it is a worrying sound,\"\nsays Mrs. Rouncewell, getting up from her chair; \"and what is to be\nnoticed in it is that it MUST BE HEARD. My Lady, who is afraid of\nnothing, admits that when it is there, it must be heard. You cannot\nshut it out. Watt, there is a tall French clock behind you (placed\nthere, 'a purpose) that has a loud beat when it is in motion and can\nplay music. You understand how those things are managed?\"\n\n\"Pretty well, grandmother, I think.\"\n\n\"Set it a-going.\"\n\nWatt sets it a-going--music and all.\n\n\"Now, come hither,\" says the housekeeper. \"Hither, child, towards my\nLady's pillow. I am not sure that it is dark enough yet, but listen!\nCan you hear the sound upon the terrace, through the music, and the\nbeat, and everything?\"\n\n\"I certainly can!\"\n\n\"So my Lady says.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII\n\nCovering a Multitude of Sins\n\n\nIt was interesting when I dressed before daylight to peep out of\nwindow, where my candles were reflected in the black panes like\ntwo beacons, and finding all beyond still enshrouded in the\nindistinctness of last night, to watch how it turned out when the day\ncame on. As the prospect gradually revealed itself and disclosed the\nscene over which the wind had wandered in the dark, like my memory\nover my life, I had a pleasure in discovering the unknown objects\nthat had been around me in my sleep. At first they were faintly\ndiscernible in the mist, and above them the later stars still\nglimmered. That pale interval over, the picture began to enlarge and\nfill up so fast that at every new peep I could have found enough\nto look at for an hour. Imperceptibly my candles became the only\nincongruous part of the morning, the dark places in my room all\nmelted away, and the day shone bright upon a cheerful landscape,\nprominent in which the old Abbey Church, with its massive tower,\nthrew a softer train of shadow on the view than seemed compatible\nwith its rugged character. But so from rough outsides (I hope I have\nlearnt), serene and gentle influences often proceed.\n\nEvery part of the house was in such order, and every one was so\nattentive to me, that I had no trouble with my two bunches of keys,\nthough what with trying to remember the contents of each little\nstore-room drawer and cupboard; and what with making notes on a slate\nabout jams, and pickles, and preserves, and bottles, and glass, and\nchina, and a great many other things; and what with being generally a\nmethodical, old-maidish sort of foolish little person, I was so busy\nthat I could not believe it was breakfast-time when I heard the bell\nring. Away I ran, however, and made tea, as I had already been\ninstalled into the responsibility of the tea-pot; and then, as they\nwere all rather late and nobody was down yet, I thought I would take\na peep at the garden and get some knowledge of that too. I found it\nquite a delightful place--in front, the pretty avenue and drive by\nwhich we had approached (and where, by the by, we had cut up the\ngravel so terribly with our wheels that I asked the gardener to roll\nit); at the back, the flower-garden, with my darling at her window up\nthere, throwing it open to smile out at me, as if she would have\nkissed me from that distance. Beyond the flower-garden was a\nkitchen-garden, and then a paddock, and then a snug little rick-yard,\nand then a dear little farm-yard. As to the house itself, with its\nthree peaks in the roof; its various-shaped windows, some so large,\nsome so small, and all so pretty; its trellis-work, against the\nsouth-front for roses and honey-suckle, and its homely, comfortable,\nwelcoming look--it was, as Ada said when she came out to meet me with\nher arm through that of its master, worthy of her cousin John, a bold\nthing to say, though he only pinched her dear cheek for it.\n\nMr. Skimpole was as agreeable at breakfast as he had been overnight.\nThere was honey on the table, and it led him into a discourse about\nbees. He had no objection to honey, he said (and I should think he\nhad not, for he seemed to like it), but he protested against the\noverweening assumptions of bees. He didn't at all see why the busy\nbee should be proposed as a model to him; he supposed the bee liked\nto make honey, or he wouldn't do it--nobody asked him. It was not\nnecessary for the bee to make such a merit of his tastes. If every\nconfectioner went buzzing about the world banging against everything\nthat came in his way and egotistically calling upon everybody to take\nnotice that he was going to his work and must not be interrupted, the\nworld would be quite an unsupportable place. Then, after all, it was\na ridiculous position to be smoked out of your fortune with brimstone\nas soon as you had made it. You would have a very mean opinion of a\nManchester man if he spun cotton for no other purpose. He must say he\nthought a drone the embodiment of a pleasanter and wiser idea. The\ndrone said unaffectedly, \"You will excuse me; I really cannot attend\nto the shop! I find myself in a world in which there is so much to\nsee and so short a time to see it in that I must take the liberty of\nlooking about me and begging to be provided for by somebody who\ndoesn't want to look about him.\" This appeared to Mr. Skimpole to be\nthe drone philosophy, and he thought it a very good philosophy,\nalways supposing the drone to be willing to be on good terms with the\nbee, which, so far as he knew, the easy fellow always was, if the\nconsequential creature would only let him, and not be so conceited\nabout his honey!\n\nHe pursued this fancy with the lightest foot over a variety of ground\nand made us all merry, though again he seemed to have as serious a\nmeaning in what he said as he was capable of having. I left them\nstill listening to him when I withdrew to attend to my new duties.\nThey had occupied me for some time, and I was passing through the\npassages on my return with my basket of keys on my arm when Mr.\nJarndyce called me into a small room next his bed-chamber, which I\nfound to be in part a little library of books and papers and in part\nquite a little museum of his boots and shoes and hat-boxes.\n\n\"Sit down, my dear,\" said Mr. Jarndyce. \"This, you must know, is the\ngrowlery. When I am out of humour, I come and growl here.\"\n\n\"You must be here very seldom, sir,\" said I.\n\n\"Oh, you don't know me!\" he returned. \"When I am deceived or\ndisappointed in--the wind, and it's easterly, I take refuge here. The\ngrowlery is the best-used room in the house. You are not aware of\nhalf my humours yet. My dear, how you are trembling!\"\n\nI could not help it; I tried very hard, but being alone with that\nbenevolent presence, and meeting his kind eyes, and feeling so happy\nand so honoured there, and my heart so full--I kissed his hand. I\ndon't know what I said, or even that I spoke. He was disconcerted and\nwalked to the window; I almost believed with an intention of jumping\nout, until he turned and I was reassured by seeing in his eyes what\nhe had gone there to hide. He gently patted me on the head, and I sat\ndown.\n\n\"There! There!\" he said. \"That's over. Pooh! Don't be foolish.\"\n\n\"It shall not happen again, sir,\" I returned, \"but at first it is\ndifficult--\"\n\n\"Nonsense!\" he said. \"It's easy, easy. Why not? I hear of a good\nlittle orphan girl without a protector, and I take it into my head to\nbe that protector. She grows up, and more than justifies my good\nopinion, and I remain her guardian and her friend. What is there in\nall this? So, so! Now, we have cleared off old scores, and I have\nbefore me thy pleasant, trusting, trusty face again.\"\n\nI said to myself, \"Esther, my dear, you surprise me! This really is\nnot what I expected of you!\" And it had such a good effect that I\nfolded my hands upon my basket and quite recovered myself. Mr.\nJarndyce, expressing his approval in his face, began to talk to me as\nconfidentially as if I had been in the habit of conversing with him\nevery morning for I don't know how long. I almost felt as if I had.\n\n\"Of course, Esther,\" he said, \"you don't understand this Chancery\nbusiness?\"\n\nAnd of course I shook my head.\n\n\"I don't know who does,\" he returned. \"The lawyers have twisted it\ninto such a state of bedevilment that the original merits of the case\nhave long disappeared from the face of the earth. It's about a will\nand the trusts under a will--or it was once. It's about nothing but\ncosts now. We are always appearing, and disappearing, and swearing,\nand interrogating, and filing, and cross-filing, and arguing, and\nsealing, and motioning, and referring, and reporting, and revolving\nabout the Lord Chancellor and all his satellites, and equitably\nwaltzing ourselves off to dusty death, about costs. That's the great\nquestion. All the rest, by some extraordinary means, has melted\naway.\"\n\n\"But it was, sir,\" said I, to bring him back, for he began to rub his\nhead, \"about a will?\"\n\n\"Why, yes, it was about a will when it was about anything,\" he\nreturned. \"A certain Jarndyce, in an evil hour, made a great fortune,\nand made a great will. In the question how the trusts under that will\nare to be administered, the fortune left by the will is squandered\naway; the legatees under the will are reduced to such a miserable\ncondition that they would be sufficiently punished if they had\ncommitted an enormous crime in having money left them, and the will\nitself is made a dead letter. All through the deplorable cause,\neverything that everybody in it, except one man, knows already is\nreferred to that only one man who don't know, it to find out--all\nthrough the deplorable cause, everybody must have copies, over and\nover again, of everything that has accumulated about it in the way of\ncartloads of papers (or must pay for them without having them, which\nis the usual course, for nobody wants them) and must go down the\nmiddle and up again through such an infernal country-dance of costs\nand fees and nonsense and corruption as was never dreamed of in the\nwildest visions of a witch's Sabbath. Equity sends questions to law,\nlaw sends questions back to equity; law finds it can't do this,\nequity finds it can't do that; neither can so much as say it can't\ndo anything, without this solicitor instructing and this counsel\nappearing for A, and that solicitor instructing and that counsel\nappearing for B; and so on through the whole alphabet, like the\nhistory of the apple pie. And thus, through years and years, and\nlives and lives, everything goes on, constantly beginning over and\nover again, and nothing ever ends. And we can't get out of the suit\non any terms, for we are made parties to it, and MUST BE parties to\nit, whether we like it or not. But it won't do to think of it! When\nmy great uncle, poor Tom Jarndyce, began to think of it, it was the\nbeginning of the end!\"\n\n\"The Mr. Jarndyce, sir, whose story I have heard?\"\n\nHe nodded gravely. \"I was his heir, and this was his house, Esther.\nWhen I came here, it was bleak indeed. He had left the signs of his\nmisery upon it.\"\n\n\"How changed it must be now!\" I said.\n\n\"It had been called, before his time, the Peaks. He gave it its\npresent name and lived here shut up, day and night poring over the\nwicked heaps of papers in the suit and hoping against hope to\ndisentangle it from its mystification and bring it to a close. In the\nmeantime, the place became dilapidated, the wind whistled through the\ncracked walls, the rain fell through the broken roof, the weeds\nchoked the passage to the rotting door. When I brought what remained\nof him home here, the brains seemed to me to have been blown out of\nthe house too, it was so shattered and ruined.\"\n\nHe walked a little to and fro after saying this to himself with a\nshudder, and then looked at me, and brightened, and came and sat down\nagain with his hands in his pockets.\n\n\"I told you this was the growlery, my dear. Where was I?\"\n\nI reminded him, at the hopeful change he had made in Bleak House.\n\n\"Bleak House; true. There is, in that city of London there, some\nproperty of ours which is much at this day what Bleak House was then;\nI say property of ours, meaning of the suit's, but I ought to call it\nthe property of costs, for costs is the only power on earth that will\never get anything out of it now or will ever know it for anything but\nan eyesore and a heartsore. It is a street of perishing blind houses,\nwith their eyes stoned out, without a pane of glass, without so much\nas a window-frame, with the bare blank shutters tumbling from their\nhinges and falling asunder, the iron rails peeling away in flakes of\nrust, the chimneys sinking in, the stone steps to every door (and\nevery door might be death's door) turning stagnant green, the very\ncrutches on which the ruins are propped decaying. Although Bleak\nHouse was not in Chancery, its master was, and it was stamped with\nthe same seal. These are the Great Seal's impressions, my dear, all\nover England--the children know them!\"\n\n\"How changed it is!\" I said again.\n\n\"Why, so it is,\" he answered much more cheerfully; \"and it is wisdom\nin you to keep me to the bright side of the picture.\" (The idea of my\nwisdom!) \"These are things I never talk about or even think about,\nexcepting in the growlery here. If you consider it right to mention\nthem to Rick and Ada,\" looking seriously at me, \"you can. I leave it\nto your discretion, Esther.\"\n\n\"I hope, sir--\" said I.\n\n\"I think you had better call me guardian, my dear.\"\n\nI felt that I was choking again--I taxed myself with it, \"Esther,\nnow, you know you are!\"--when he feigned to say this slightly, as if\nit were a whim instead of a thoughtful tenderness. But I gave the\nhousekeeping keys the least shake in the world as a reminder to\nmyself, and folding my hands in a still more determined manner on the\nbasket, looked at him quietly.\n\n\"I hope, guardian,\" said I, \"that you may not trust too much to my\ndiscretion. I hope you may not mistake me. I am afraid it will be a\ndisappointment to you to know that I am not clever, but it really is\nthe truth, and you would soon find it out if I had not the honesty to\nconfess it.\"\n\nHe did not seem at all disappointed; quite the contrary. He told me,\nwith a smile all over his face, that he knew me very well indeed and\nthat I was quite clever enough for him.\n\n\"I hope I may turn out so,\" said I, \"but I am much afraid of it,\nguardian.\"\n\n\"You are clever enough to be the good little woman of our lives here,\nmy dear,\" he returned playfully; \"the little old woman of the child's\n(I don't mean Skimpole's) rhyme:\n\n\n   \"'Little old woman, and whither so high?'\n    'To sweep the cobwebs out of the sky.'\n\n\n\"You will sweep them so neatly out of OUR sky in the course of your\nhousekeeping, Esther, that one of these days we shall have to abandon\nthe growlery and nail up the door.\"\n\nThis was the beginning of my being called Old Woman, and Little Old\nWoman, and Cobweb, and Mrs. Shipton, and Mother Hubbard, and Dame\nDurden, and so many names of that sort that my own name soon became\nquite lost among them.\n\n\"However,\" said Mr. Jarndyce, \"to return to our gossip. Here's Rick,\na fine young fellow full of promise. What's to be done with him?\"\n\nOh, my goodness, the idea of asking my advice on such a point!\n\n\"Here he is, Esther,\" said Mr. Jarndyce, comfortably putting his\nhands into his pockets and stretching out his legs. \"He must have a\nprofession; he must make some choice for himself. There will be a\nworld more wiglomeration about it, I suppose, but it must be done.\"\n\n\"More what, guardian?\" said I.\n\n\"More wiglomeration,\" said he. \"It's the only name I know for the\nthing. He is a ward in Chancery, my dear. Kenge and Carboy will have\nsomething to say about it; Master Somebody--a sort of ridiculous\nsexton, digging graves for the merits of causes in a back room at the\nend of Quality Court, Chancery Lane--will have something to say about\nit; counsel will have something to say about it; the Chancellor will\nhave something to say about it; the satellites will have something to\nsay about it; they will all have to be handsomely feed, all round,\nabout it; the whole thing will be vastly ceremonious, wordy,\nunsatisfactory, and expensive, and I call it, in general,\nwiglomeration. How mankind ever came to be afflicted with\nwiglomeration, or for whose sins these young people ever fell into a\npit of it, I don't know; so it is.\"\n\nHe began to rub his head again and to hint that he felt the wind. But\nit was a delightful instance of his kindness towards me that whether\nhe rubbed his head, or walked about, or did both, his face was sure\nto recover its benignant expression as it looked at mine; and he was\nsure to turn comfortable again and put his hands in his pockets and\nstretch out his legs.\n\n\"Perhaps it would be best, first of all,\" said I, \"to ask Mr. Richard\nwhat he inclines to himself.\"\n\n\"Exactly so,\" he returned. \"That's what I mean! You know, just\naccustom yourself to talk it over, with your tact and in your quiet\nway, with him and Ada, and see what you all make of it. We are sure\nto come at the heart of the matter by your means, little woman.\"\n\nI really was frightened at the thought of the importance I was\nattaining and the number of things that were being confided to me. I\nhad not meant this at all; I had meant that he should speak to\nRichard. But of course I said nothing in reply except that I would do\nmy best, though I feared (I really felt it necessary to repeat this)\nthat he thought me much more sagacious than I was. At which my\nguardian only laughed the pleasantest laugh I ever heard.\n\n\"Come!\" he said, rising and pushing back his chair. \"I think we may\nhave done with the growlery for one day! Only a concluding word.\nEsther, my dear, do you wish to ask me anything?\"\n\nHe looked so attentively at me that I looked attentively at him and\nfelt sure I understood him.\n\n\"About myself, sir?\" said I.\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Guardian,\" said I, venturing to put my hand, which was suddenly\ncolder than I could have wished, in his, \"nothing! I am quite sure\nthat if there were anything I ought to know or had any need to know,\nI should not have to ask you to tell it to me. If my whole reliance\nand confidence were not placed in you, I must have a hard heart\nindeed. I have nothing to ask you, nothing in the world.\"\n\nHe drew my hand through his arm and we went away to look for Ada.\nFrom that hour I felt quite easy with him, quite unreserved, quite\ncontent to know no more, quite happy.\n\nWe lived, at first, rather a busy life at Bleak House, for we had to\nbecome acquainted with many residents in and out of the neighbourhood\nwho knew Mr. Jarndyce. It seemed to Ada and me that everybody knew\nhim who wanted to do anything with anybody else's money. It amazed us\nwhen we began to sort his letters and to answer some of them for him\nin the growlery of a morning to find how the great object of the\nlives of nearly all his correspondents appeared to be to form\nthemselves into committees for getting in and laying out money. The\nladies were as desperate as the gentlemen; indeed, I think they were\neven more so. They threw themselves into committees in the most\nimpassioned manner and collected subscriptions with a vehemence quite\nextraordinary. It appeared to us that some of them must pass their\nwhole lives in dealing out subscription-cards to the whole\npost-office directory--shilling cards, half-crown cards,\nhalf-sovereign cards, penny cards. They wanted everything. They\nwanted wearing apparel, they wanted linen rags, they wanted money,\nthey wanted coals, they wanted soup, they wanted interest, they\nwanted autographs, they wanted flannel, they wanted whatever Mr.\nJarndyce had--or had not. Their objects were as various as their\ndemands. They were going to raise new buildings, they were going to\npay off debts on old buildings, they were going to establish in a\npicturesque building (engraving of proposed west elevation attached)\nthe Sisterhood of Mediaeval Marys, they were going to give a\ntestimonial to Mrs. Jellyby, they were going to have their\nsecretary's portrait painted and presented to his mother-in-law,\nwhose deep devotion to him was well known, they were going to get up\neverything, I really believe, from five hundred thousand tracts to an\nannuity and from a marble monument to a silver tea-pot. They took a\nmultitude of titles. They were the Women of England, the Daughters of\nBritain, the Sisters of all the cardinal virtues separately, the\nFemales of America, the Ladies of a hundred denominations. They\nappeared to be always excited about canvassing and electing. They\nseemed to our poor wits, and according to their own accounts, to be\nconstantly polling people by tens of thousands, yet never bringing\ntheir candidates in for anything. It made our heads ache to think, on\nthe whole, what feverish lives they must lead.\n\nAmong the ladies who were most distinguished for this rapacious\nbenevolence (if I may use the expression) was a Mrs. Pardiggle, who\nseemed, as I judged from the number of her letters to Mr. Jarndyce,\nto be almost as powerful a correspondent as Mrs. Jellyby herself. We\nobserved that the wind always changed when Mrs. Pardiggle became the\nsubject of conversation and that it invariably interrupted Mr.\nJarndyce and prevented his going any farther, when he had remarked\nthat there were two classes of charitable people; one, the people who\ndid a little and made a great deal of noise; the other, the people\nwho did a great deal and made no noise at all. We were therefore\ncurious to see Mrs. Pardiggle, suspecting her to be a type of the\nformer class, and were glad when she called one day with her five\nyoung sons.\n\nShe was a formidable style of lady with spectacles, a prominent nose,\nand a loud voice, who had the effect of wanting a great deal of room.\nAnd she really did, for she knocked down little chairs with her\nskirts that were quite a great way off. As only Ada and I were at\nhome, we received her timidly, for she seemed to come in like cold\nweather and to make the little Pardiggles blue as they followed.\n\n\"These, young ladies,\" said Mrs. Pardiggle with great volubility\nafter the first salutations, \"are my five boys. You may have seen\ntheir names in a printed subscription list (perhaps more than one) in\nthe possession of our esteemed friend Mr. Jarndyce. Egbert, my eldest\n(twelve), is the boy who sent out his pocket-money, to the amount of\nfive and threepence, to the Tockahoopo Indians. Oswald, my second\n(ten and a half), is the child who contributed two and nine-pence to\nthe Great National Smithers Testimonial. Francis, my third (nine),\none and sixpence halfpenny; Felix, my fourth (seven), eightpence to\nthe Superannuated Widows; Alfred, my youngest (five), has voluntarily\nenrolled himself in the Infant Bonds of Joy, and is pledged never,\nthrough life, to use tobacco in any form.\"\n\nWe had never seen such dissatisfied children. It was not merely that\nthey were weazened and shrivelled--though they were certainly that\ntoo--but they looked absolutely ferocious with discontent. At the\nmention of the Tockahoopo Indians, I could really have supposed\nEgbert to be one of the most baleful members of that tribe, he gave\nme such a savage frown. The face of each child, as the amount of his\ncontribution was mentioned, darkened in a peculiarly vindictive\nmanner, but his was by far the worst. I must except, however, the\nlittle recruit into the Infant Bonds of Joy, who was stolidly and\nevenly miserable.\n\n\"You have been visiting, I understand,\" said Mrs. Pardiggle, \"at Mrs.\nJellyby's?\"\n\nWe said yes, we had passed one night there.\n\n\"Mrs. Jellyby,\" pursued the lady, always speaking in the same\ndemonstrative, loud, hard tone, so that her voice impressed my fancy\nas if it had a sort of spectacles on too--and I may take the\nopportunity of remarking that her spectacles were made the less\nengaging by her eyes being what Ada called \"choking eyes,\" meaning\nvery prominent--\"Mrs. Jellyby is a benefactor to society and deserves\na helping hand. My boys have contributed to the African\nproject--Egbert, one and six, being the entire allowance of nine\nweeks; Oswald, one and a penny halfpenny, being the same; the rest,\naccording to their little means. Nevertheless, I do not go with Mrs.\nJellyby in all things. I do not go with Mrs. Jellyby in her treatment\nof her young family. It has been noticed. It has been observed that\nher young family are excluded from participation in the objects to\nwhich she is devoted. She may be right, she may be wrong; but, right\nor wrong, this is not my course with MY young family. I take them\neverywhere.\"\n\nI was afterwards convinced (and so was Ada) that from the\nill-conditioned eldest child, these words extorted a sharp yell. He\nturned it off into a yawn, but it began as a yell.\n\n\"They attend matins with me (very prettily done) at half-past six\no'clock in the morning all the year round, including of course the\ndepth of winter,\" said Mrs. Pardiggle rapidly, \"and they are with me\nduring the revolving duties of the day. I am a School lady, I am a\nVisiting lady, I am a Reading lady, I am a Distributing lady; I am on\nthe local Linen Box Committee and many general committees; and my\ncanvassing alone is very extensive--perhaps no one's more so. But\nthey are my companions everywhere; and by these means they acquire\nthat knowledge of the poor, and that capacity of doing charitable\nbusiness in general--in short, that taste for the sort of\nthing--which will render them in after life a service to their\nneighbours and a satisfaction to themselves. My young family are not\nfrivolous; they expend the entire amount of their allowance in\nsubscriptions, under my direction; and they have attended as many\npublic meetings and listened to as many lectures, orations, and\ndiscussions as generally fall to the lot of few grown people. Alfred\n(five), who, as I mentioned, has of his own election joined the\nInfant Bonds of Joy, was one of the very few children who manifested\nconsciousness on that occasion after a fervid address of two hours\nfrom the chairman of the evening.\"\n\nAlfred glowered at us as if he never could, or would, forgive the\ninjury of that night.\n\n\"You may have observed, Miss Summerson,\" said Mrs. Pardiggle, \"in\nsome of the lists to which I have referred, in the possession of our\nesteemed friend Mr. Jarndyce, that the names of my young family are\nconcluded with the name of O. A. Pardiggle, F.R.S., one pound. That\nis their father. We usually observe the same routine. I put down my\nmite first; then my young family enrol their contributions, according\nto their ages and their little means; and then Mr. Pardiggle brings\nup the rear. Mr. Pardiggle is happy to throw in his limited donation,\nunder my direction; and thus things are made not only pleasant to\nourselves, but, we trust, improving to others.\"\n\nSuppose Mr. Pardiggle were to dine with Mr. Jellyby, and suppose Mr.\nJellyby were to relieve his mind after dinner to Mr. Pardiggle, would\nMr. Pardiggle, in return, make any confidential communication to Mr.\nJellyby? I was quite confused to find myself thinking this, but it\ncame into my head.\n\n\"You are very pleasantly situated here!\" said Mrs. Pardiggle.\n\nWe were glad to change the subject, and going to the window, pointed\nout the beauties of the prospect, on which the spectacles appeared to\nme to rest with curious indifference.\n\n\"You know Mr. Gusher?\" said our visitor.\n\nWe were obliged to say that we had not the pleasure of Mr. Gusher's\nacquaintance.\n\n\"The loss is yours, I assure you,\" said Mrs. Pardiggle with her\ncommanding deportment. \"He is a very fervid, impassioned\nspeaker--full of fire! Stationed in a waggon on this lawn, now,\nwhich, from the shape of the land, is naturally adapted to a public\nmeeting, he would improve almost any occasion you could mention for\nhours and hours! By this time, young ladies,\" said Mrs. Pardiggle,\nmoving back to her chair and overturning, as if by invisible agency,\na little round table at a considerable distance with my work-basket\non it, \"by this time you have found me out, I dare say?\"\n\nThis was really such a confusing question that Ada looked at me in\nperfect dismay. As to the guilty nature of my own consciousness after\nwhat I had been thinking, it must have been expressed in the colour\nof my cheeks.\n\n\"Found out, I mean,\" said Mrs. Pardiggle, \"the prominent point in my\ncharacter. I am aware that it is so prominent as to be discoverable\nimmediately. I lay myself open to detection, I know. Well! I freely\nadmit, I am a woman of business. I love hard work; I enjoy hard work.\nThe excitement does me good. I am so accustomed and inured to hard\nwork that I don't know what fatigue is.\"\n\nWe murmured that it was very astonishing and very gratifying, or\nsomething to that effect. I don't think we knew what it was either,\nbut this is what our politeness expressed.\n\n\"I do not understand what it is to be tired; you cannot tire me if\nyou try!\" said Mrs. Pardiggle. \"The quantity of exertion (which is no\nexertion to me), the amount of business (which I regard as nothing),\nthat I go through sometimes astonishes myself. I have seen my young\nfamily, and Mr. Pardiggle, quite worn out with witnessing it, when I\nmay truly say I have been as fresh as a lark!\"\n\nIf that dark-visaged eldest boy could look more malicious than he had\nalready looked, this was the time when he did it. I observed that he\ndoubled his right fist and delivered a secret blow into the crown of\nhis cap, which was under his left arm.\n\n\"This gives me a great advantage when I am making my rounds,\" said\nMrs. Pardiggle. \"If I find a person unwilling to hear what I have to\nsay, I tell that person directly, 'I am incapable of fatigue, my good\nfriend, I am never tired, and I mean to go on until I have done.' It\nanswers admirably! Miss Summerson, I hope I shall have your\nassistance in my visiting rounds immediately, and Miss Clare's very\nsoon.\"\n\nAt first I tried to excuse myself for the present on the general\nground of having occupations to attend to which I must not neglect.\nBut as this was an ineffectual protest, I then said, more\nparticularly, that I was not sure of my qualifications. That I was\ninexperienced in the art of adapting my mind to minds very\ndifferently situated, and addressing them from suitable points of\nview. That I had not that delicate knowledge of the heart which must\nbe essential to such a work. That I had much to learn, myself, before\nI could teach others, and that I could not confide in my good\nintentions alone. For these reasons I thought it best to be as useful\nas I could, and to render what kind services I could to those\nimmediately about me, and to try to let that circle of duty gradually\nand naturally expand itself. All this I said with anything but\nconfidence, because Mrs. Pardiggle was much older than I, and had\ngreat experience, and was so very military in her manners.\n\n\"You are wrong, Miss Summerson,\" said she, \"but perhaps you are not\nequal to hard work or the excitement of it, and that makes a vast\ndifference. If you would like to see how I go through my work, I am\nnow about--with my young family--to visit a brickmaker in the\nneighbourhood (a very bad character) and shall be glad to take you\nwith me. Miss Clare also, if she will do me the favour.\"\n\nAda and I interchanged looks, and as we were going out in any case,\naccepted the offer. When we hastily returned from putting on our\nbonnets, we found the young family languishing in a corner and Mrs.\nPardiggle sweeping about the room, knocking down nearly all the light\nobjects it contained. Mrs. Pardiggle took possession of Ada, and I\nfollowed with the family.\n\nAda told me afterwards that Mrs. Pardiggle talked in the same loud\ntone (that, indeed, I overheard) all the way to the brickmaker's\nabout an exciting contest which she had for two or three years waged\nagainst another lady relative to the bringing in of their rival\ncandidates for a pension somewhere. There had been a quantity of\nprinting, and promising, and proxying, and polling, and it appeared\nto have imparted great liveliness to all concerned, except the\npensioners--who were not elected yet.\n\nI am very fond of being confided in by children and am happy in being\nusually favoured in that respect, but on this occasion it gave me\ngreat uneasiness. As soon as we were out of doors, Egbert, with the\nmanner of a little footpad, demanded a shilling of me on the ground\nthat his pocket-money was \"boned\" from him. On my pointing out the\ngreat impropriety of the word, especially in connexion with his\nparent (for he added sulkily \"By her!\"), he pinched me and said, \"Oh,\nthen! Now! Who are you! YOU wouldn't like it, I think? What does she\nmake a sham for, and pretend to give me money, and take it away\nagain? Why do you call it my allowance, and never let me spend it?\"\nThese exasperating questions so inflamed his mind and the minds of\nOswald and Francis that they all pinched me at once, and in a\ndreadfully expert way--screwing up such little pieces of my arms that\nI could hardly forbear crying out. Felix, at the same time, stamped\nupon my toes. And the Bond of Joy, who on account of always having\nthe whole of his little income anticipated stood in fact pledged to\nabstain from cakes as well as tobacco, so swelled with grief and rage\nwhen we passed a pastry-cook's shop that he terrified me by becoming\npurple. I never underwent so much, both in body and mind, in the\ncourse of a walk with young people as from these unnaturally\nconstrained children when they paid me the compliment of being\nnatural.\n\nI was glad when we came to the brickmaker's house, though it was one\nof a cluster of wretched hovels in a brick-field, with pigsties close\nto the broken windows and miserable little gardens before the doors\ngrowing nothing but stagnant pools. Here and there an old tub was put\nto catch the droppings of rain-water from a roof, or they were banked\nup with mud into a little pond like a large dirt-pie. At the doors\nand windows some men and women lounged or prowled about, and took\nlittle notice of us except to laugh to one another or to say\nsomething as we passed about gentlefolks minding their own business\nand not troubling their heads and muddying their shoes with coming to\nlook after other people's.\n\nMrs. Pardiggle, leading the way with a great show of moral\ndetermination and talking with much volubility about the untidy\nhabits of the people (though I doubted if the best of us could have\nbeen tidy in such a place), conducted us into a cottage at the\nfarthest corner, the ground-floor room of which we nearly filled.\nBesides ourselves, there were in this damp, offensive room a woman\nwith a black eye, nursing a poor little gasping baby by the fire; a\nman, all stained with clay and mud and looking very dissipated, lying\nat full length on the ground, smoking a pipe; a powerful young man\nfastening a collar on a dog; and a bold girl doing some kind of\nwashing in very dirty water. They all looked up at us as we came in,\nand the woman seemed to turn her face towards the fire as if to hide\nher bruised eye; nobody gave us any welcome.\n\n\"Well, my friends,\" said Mrs. Pardiggle, but her voice had not a\nfriendly sound, I thought; it was much too business-like and\nsystematic. \"How do you do, all of you? I am here again. I told you,\nyou couldn't tire me, you know. I am fond of hard work, and am true\nto my word.\"\n\n\"There an't,\" growled the man on the floor, whose head rested on his\nhand as he stared at us, \"any more on you to come in, is there?\"\n\n\"No, my friend,\" said Mrs. Pardiggle, seating herself on one stool\nand knocking down another. \"We are all here.\"\n\n\"Because I thought there warn't enough of you, perhaps?\" said the\nman, with his pipe between his lips as he looked round upon us.\n\nThe young man and the girl both laughed. Two friends of the young\nman, whom we had attracted to the doorway and who stood there with\ntheir hands in their pockets, echoed the laugh noisily.\n\n\"You can't tire me, good people,\" said Mrs. Pardiggle to these\nlatter. \"I enjoy hard work, and the harder you make mine, the better\nI like it.\"\n\n\"Then make it easy for her!\" growled the man upon the floor. \"I wants\nit done, and over. I wants a end of these liberties took with my\nplace. I wants an end of being drawed like a badger. Now you're\na-going to poll-pry and question according to custom--I know what\nyou're a-going to be up to. Well! You haven't got no occasion to be\nup to it. I'll save you the trouble. Is my daughter a-washin? Yes,\nshe IS a-washin. Look at the water. Smell it! That's wot we drinks.\nHow do you like it, and what do you think of gin instead! An't my\nplace dirty? Yes, it is dirty--it's nat'rally dirty, and it's\nnat'rally onwholesome; and we've had five dirty and onwholesome\nchildren, as is all dead infants, and so much the better for them,\nand for us besides. Have I read the little book wot you left? No, I\nan't read the little book wot you left. There an't nobody here as\nknows how to read it; and if there wos, it wouldn't be suitable to\nme. It's a book fit for a babby, and I'm not a babby. If you was to\nleave me a doll, I shouldn't nuss it. How have I been conducting of\nmyself? Why, I've been drunk for three days; and I'da been drunk four\nif I'da had the money. Don't I never mean for to go to church? No, I\ndon't never mean for to go to church. I shouldn't be expected there,\nif I did; the beadle's too gen-teel for me. And how did my wife get\nthat black eye? Why, I give it her; and if she says I didn't, she's a\nlie!\"\n\nHe had pulled his pipe out of his mouth to say all this, and he now\nturned over on his other side and smoked again. Mrs. Pardiggle, who\nhad been regarding him through her spectacles with a forcible\ncomposure, calculated, I could not help thinking, to increase his\nantagonism, pulled out a good book as if it were a constable's staff\nand took the whole family into custody. I mean into religious\ncustody, of course; but she really did it as if she were an\ninexorable moral policeman carrying them all off to a station-house.\n\nAda and I were very uncomfortable. We both felt intrusive and out of\nplace, and we both thought that Mrs. Pardiggle would have got on\ninfinitely better if she had not had such a mechanical way of taking\npossession of people. The children sulked and stared; the family took\nno notice of us whatever, except when the young man made the dog\nbark, which he usually did when Mrs. Pardiggle was most emphatic. We\nboth felt painfully sensible that between us and these people there\nwas an iron barrier which could not be removed by our new friend. By\nwhom or how it could be removed, we did not know, but we knew that.\nEven what she read and said seemed to us to be ill-chosen for such\nauditors, if it had been imparted ever so modestly and with ever so\nmuch tact. As to the little book to which the man on the floor had\nreferred, we acquired a knowledge of it afterwards, and Mr. Jarndyce\nsaid he doubted if Robinson Crusoe could have read it, though he had\nhad no other on his desolate island.\n\nWe were much relieved, under these circumstances, when Mrs. Pardiggle\nleft off.\n\nThe man on the floor, then turning his head round again, said\nmorosely, \"Well! You've done, have you?\"\n\n\"For to-day, I have, my friend. But I am never fatigued. I shall come\nto you again in your regular order,\" returned Mrs. Pardiggle with\ndemonstrative cheerfulness.\n\n\"So long as you goes now,\" said he, folding his arms and shutting his\neyes with an oath, \"you may do wot you like!\"\n\nMrs. Pardiggle accordingly rose and made a little vortex in the\nconfined room from which the pipe itself very narrowly escaped.\nTaking one of her young family in each hand, and telling the others\nto follow closely, and expressing her hope that the brickmaker and\nall his house would be improved when she saw them next, she then\nproceeded to another cottage. I hope it is not unkind in me to say\nthat she certainly did make, in this as in everything else, a show\nthat was not conciliatory of doing charity by wholesale and of\ndealing in it to a large extent.\n\nShe supposed that we were following her, but as soon as the space was\nleft clear, we approached the woman sitting by the fire to ask if the\nbaby were ill.\n\nShe only looked at it as it lay on her lap. We had observed before\nthat when she looked at it she covered her discoloured eye with her\nhand, as though she wished to separate any association with noise and\nviolence and ill treatment from the poor little child.\n\nAda, whose gentle heart was moved by its appearance, bent down to\ntouch its little face. As she did so, I saw what happened and drew\nher back. The child died.\n\n\"Oh, Esther!\" cried Ada, sinking on her knees beside it. \"Look here!\nOh, Esther, my love, the little thing! The suffering, quiet, pretty\nlittle thing! I am so sorry for it. I am so sorry for the mother. I\nnever saw a sight so pitiful as this before! Oh, baby, baby!\"\n\nSuch compassion, such gentleness, as that with which she bent down\nweeping and put her hand upon the mother's might have softened any\nmother's heart that ever beat. The woman at first gazed at her in\nastonishment and then burst into tears.\n\nPresently I took the light burden from her lap, did what I could to\nmake the baby's rest the prettier and gentler, laid it on a shelf,\nand covered it with my own handkerchief. We tried to comfort the\nmother, and we whispered to her what Our Saviour said of children.\nShe answered nothing, but sat weeping--weeping very much.\n\nWhen I turned, I found that the young man had taken out the dog and\nwas standing at the door looking in upon us with dry eyes, but quiet.\nThe girl was quiet too and sat in a corner looking on the ground. The\nman had risen. He still smoked his pipe with an air of defiance, but\nhe was silent.\n\nAn ugly woman, very poorly clothed, hurried in while I was glancing\nat them, and coming straight up to the mother, said, \"Jenny! Jenny!\"\nThe mother rose on being so addressed and fell upon the woman's neck.\n\nShe also had upon her face and arms the marks of ill usage. She had\nno kind of grace about her, but the grace of sympathy; but when she\ncondoled with the woman, and her own tears fell, she wanted no\nbeauty. I say condoled, but her only words were \"Jenny! Jenny!\" All\nthe rest was in the tone in which she said them.\n\nI thought it very touching to see these two women, coarse and shabby\nand beaten, so united; to see what they could be to one another; to\nsee how they felt for one another, how the heart of each to each was\nsoftened by the hard trials of their lives. I think the best side of\nsuch people is almost hidden from us. What the poor are to the poor\nis little known, excepting to themselves and God.\n\nWe felt it better to withdraw and leave them uninterrupted. We stole\nout quietly and without notice from any one except the man. He was\nleaning against the wall near the door, and finding that there was\nscarcely room for us to pass, went out before us. He seemed to want\nto hide that he did this on our account, but we perceived that he\ndid, and thanked him. He made no answer.\n\nAda was so full of grief all the way home, and Richard, whom we found\nat home, was so distressed to see her in tears (though he said to me,\nwhen she was not present, how beautiful it was too!), that we\narranged to return at night with some little comforts and repeat our\nvisit at the brick-maker's house. We said as little as we could to\nMr. Jarndyce, but the wind changed directly.\n\nRichard accompanied us at night to the scene of our morning\nexpedition. On our way there, we had to pass a noisy drinking-house,\nwhere a number of men were flocking about the door. Among them, and\nprominent in some dispute, was the father of the little child. At a\nshort distance, we passed the young man and the dog, in congenial\ncompany. The sister was standing laughing and talking with some other\nyoung women at the corner of the row of cottages, but she seemed\nashamed and turned away as we went by.\n\nWe left our escort within sight of the brickmaker's dwelling and\nproceeded by ourselves. When we came to the door, we found the woman\nwho had brought such consolation with her standing there looking\nanxiously out.\n\n\"It's you, young ladies, is it?\" she said in a whisper. \"I'm\na-watching for my master. My heart's in my mouth. If he was to catch\nme away from home, he'd pretty near murder me.\"\n\n\"Do you mean your husband?\" said I.\n\n\"Yes, miss, my master. Jenny's asleep, quite worn out. She's scarcely\nhad the child off her lap, poor thing, these seven days and nights,\nexcept when I've been able to take it for a minute or two.\"\n\nAs she gave way for us, she went softly in and put what we had\nbrought near the miserable bed on which the mother slept. No effort\nhad been made to clean the room--it seemed in its nature almost\nhopeless of being clean; but the small waxen form from which so much\nsolemnity diffused itself had been composed afresh, and washed, and\nneatly dressed in some fragments of white linen; and on my\nhandkerchief, which still covered the poor baby, a little bunch of\nsweet herbs had been laid by the same rough, scarred hands, so\nlightly, so tenderly!\n\n\"May heaven reward you!\" we said to her. \"You are a good woman.\"\n\n\"Me, young ladies?\" she returned with surprise. \"Hush! Jenny, Jenny!\"\n\nThe mother had moaned in her sleep and moved. The sound of the\nfamiliar voice seemed to calm her again. She was quiet once more.\n\nHow little I thought, when I raised my handkerchief to look upon the\ntiny sleeper underneath and seemed to see a halo shine around the\nchild through Ada's drooping hair as her pity bent her head--how\nlittle I thought in whose unquiet bosom that handkerchief would come\nto lie after covering the motionless and peaceful breast! I only\nthought that perhaps the Angel of the child might not be all\nunconscious of the woman who replaced it with so compassionate a\nhand; not all unconscious of her presently, when we had taken leave,\nand left her at the door, by turns looking, and listening in terror\nfor herself, and saying in her old soothing manner, \"Jenny, Jenny!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX\n\nSigns and Tokens\n\n\nI don't know how it is I seem to be always writing about myself. I\nmean all the time to write about other people, and I try to think\nabout myself as little as possible, and I am sure, when I find myself\ncoming into the story again, I am really vexed and say, \"Dear, dear,\nyou tiresome little creature, I wish you wouldn't!\" but it is all of\nno use. I hope any one who may read what I write will understand that\nif these pages contain a great deal about me, I can only suppose it\nmust be because I have really something to do with them and can't be\nkept out.\n\nMy darling and I read together, and worked, and practised, and found\nso much employment for our time that the winter days flew by us like\nbright-winged birds. Generally in the afternoons, and always in the\nevenings, Richard gave us his company. Although he was one of the\nmost restless creatures in the world, he certainly was very fond of\nour society.\n\nHe was very, very, very fond of Ada. I mean it, and I had better say\nit at once. I had never seen any young people falling in love before,\nbut I found them out quite soon. I could not say so, of course, or\nshow that I knew anything about it. On the contrary, I was so demure\nand used to seem so unconscious that sometimes I considered within\nmyself while I was sitting at work whether I was not growing quite\ndeceitful.\n\nBut there was no help for it. All I had to do was to be quiet, and I\nwas as quiet as a mouse. They were as quiet as mice too, so far as\nany words were concerned, but the innocent manner in which they\nrelied more and more upon me as they took more and more to one\nanother was so charming that I had great difficulty in not showing\nhow it interested me.\n\n\"Our dear little old woman is such a capital old woman,\" Richard\nwould say, coming up to meet me in the garden early, with his\npleasant laugh and perhaps the least tinge of a blush, \"that I can't\nget on without her. Before I begin my harum-scarum day--grinding away\nat those books and instruments and then galloping up hill and down\ndale, all the country round, like a highwayman--it does me so much\ngood to come and have a steady walk with our comfortable friend, that\nhere I am again!\"\n\n\"You know, Dame Durden, dear,\" Ada would say at night, with her head\nupon my shoulder and the firelight shining in her thoughtful eyes, \"I\ndon't want to talk when we come upstairs here. Only to sit a little\nwhile thinking, with your dear face for company, and to hear the wind\nand remember the poor sailors at sea--\"\n\nAh! Perhaps Richard was going to be a sailor. We had talked it over\nvery often now, and there was some talk of gratifying the inclination\nof his childhood for the sea. Mr. Jarndyce had written to a relation\nof the family, a great Sir Leicester Dedlock, for his interest in\nRichard's favour, generally; and Sir Leicester had replied in a\ngracious manner that he would be happy to advance the prospects of\nthe young gentleman if it should ever prove to be within his power,\nwhich was not at all probable, and that my Lady sent her compliments\nto the young gentleman (to whom she perfectly remembered that she was\nallied by remote consanguinity) and trusted that he would ever do his\nduty in any honourable profession to which he might devote himself.\n\n\"So I apprehend it's pretty clear,\" said Richard to me, \"that I shall\nhave to work my own way. Never mind! Plenty of people have had to do\nthat before now, and have done it. I only wish I had the command of a\nclipping privateer to begin with and could carry off the Chancellor\nand keep him on short allowance until he gave judgment in our cause.\nHe'd find himself growing thin, if he didn't look sharp!\"\n\nWith a buoyancy and hopefulness and a gaiety that hardly ever\nflagged, Richard had a carelessness in his character that quite\nperplexed me, principally because he mistook it, in such a very odd\nway, for prudence. It entered into all his calculations about money\nin a singular manner which I don't think I can better explain than by\nreverting for a moment to our loan to Mr. Skimpole.\n\nMr. Jarndyce had ascertained the amount, either from Mr. Skimpole\nhimself or from Coavinses, and had placed the money in my hands with\ninstructions to me to retain my own part of it and hand the rest to\nRichard. The number of little acts of thoughtless expenditure which\nRichard justified by the recovery of his ten pounds, and the number\nof times he talked to me as if he had saved or realized that amount,\nwould form a sum in simple addition.\n\n\"My prudent Mother Hubbard, why not?\" he said to me when he wanted,\nwithout the least consideration, to bestow five pounds on the\nbrickmaker. \"I made ten pounds, clear, out of Coavinses' business.\"\n\n\"How was that?\" said I.\n\n\"Why, I got rid of ten pounds which I was quite content to get rid of\nand never expected to see any more. You don't deny that?\"\n\n\"No,\" said I.\n\n\"Very well! Then I came into possession of ten pounds--\"\n\n\"The same ten pounds,\" I hinted.\n\n\"That has nothing to do with it!\" returned Richard. \"I have got ten\npounds more than I expected to have, and consequently I can afford to\nspend it without being particular.\"\n\nIn exactly the same way, when he was persuaded out of the sacrifice\nof these five pounds by being convinced that it would do no good, he\ncarried that sum to his credit and drew upon it.\n\n\"Let me see!\" he would say. \"I saved five pounds out of the\nbrickmaker's affair, so if I have a good rattle to London and back in\na post-chaise and put that down at four pounds, I shall have saved\none. And it's a very good thing to save one, let me tell you: a penny\nsaved is a penny got!\"\n\nI believe Richard's was as frank and generous a nature as there\npossibly can be. He was ardent and brave, and in the midst of all his\nwild restlessness, was so gentle that I knew him like a brother in a\nfew weeks. His gentleness was natural to him and would have shown\nitself abundantly even without Ada's influence; but with it, he\nbecame one of the most winning of companions, always so ready to be\ninterested and always so happy, sanguine, and light-hearted. I am\nsure that I, sitting with them, and walking with them, and talking\nwith them, and noticing from day to day how they went on, falling\ndeeper and deeper in love, and saying nothing about it, and each\nshyly thinking that this love was the greatest of secrets, perhaps\nnot yet suspected even by the other--I am sure that I was scarcely\nless enchanted than they were and scarcely less pleased with the\npretty dream.\n\nWe were going on in this way, when one morning at breakfast Mr.\nJarndyce received a letter, and looking at the superscription, said,\n\"From Boythorn? Aye, aye!\" and opened and read it with evident\npleasure, announcing to us in a parenthesis when he was about\nhalf-way through, that Boythorn was \"coming down\" on a visit. Now who\nwas Boythorn, we all thought. And I dare say we all thought too--I am\nsure I did, for one--would Boythorn at all interfere with what was\ngoing forward?\n\n\"I went to school with this fellow, Lawrence Boythorn,\" said Mr.\nJarndyce, tapping the letter as he laid it on the table, \"more than\nfive and forty years ago. He was then the most impetuous boy in the\nworld, and he is now the most impetuous man. He was then the loudest\nboy in the world, and he is now the loudest man. He was then the\nheartiest and sturdiest boy in the world, and he is now the heartiest\nand sturdiest man. He is a tremendous fellow.\"\n\n\"In stature, sir?\" asked Richard.\n\n\"Pretty well, Rick, in that respect,\" said Mr. Jarndyce; \"being some\nten years older than I and a couple of inches taller, with his head\nthrown back like an old soldier, his stalwart chest squared, his\nhands like a clean blacksmith's, and his lungs! There's no simile for\nhis lungs. Talking, laughing, or snoring, they make the beams of the\nhouse shake.\"\n\nAs Mr. Jarndyce sat enjoying the image of his friend Boythorn, we\nobserved the favourable omen that there was not the least indication\nof any change in the wind.\n\n\"But it's the inside of the man, the warm heart of the man, the\npassion of the man, the fresh blood of the man, Rick--and Ada, and\nlittle Cobweb too, for you are all interested in a visitor--that I\nspeak of,\" he pursued. \"His language is as sounding as his voice. He\nis always in extremes, perpetually in the superlative degree. In his\ncondemnation he is all ferocity. You might suppose him to be an ogre\nfrom what he says, and I believe he has the reputation of one with\nsome people. There! I tell you no more of him beforehand. You must\nnot be surprised to see him take me under his protection, for he has\nnever forgotten that I was a low boy at school and that our\nfriendship began in his knocking two of my head tyrant's teeth out\n(he says six) before breakfast. Boythorn and his man,\" to me, \"will\nbe here this afternoon, my dear.\"\n\nI took care that the necessary preparations were made for Mr.\nBoythorn's reception, and we looked forward to his arrival with some\ncuriosity. The afternoon wore away, however, and he did not appear.\nThe dinner-hour arrived, and still he did not appear. The dinner was\nput back an hour, and we were sitting round the fire with no light\nbut the blaze when the hall-door suddenly burst open and the hall\nresounded with these words, uttered with the greatest vehemence and\nin a stentorian tone: \"We have been misdirected, Jarndyce, by a most\nabandoned ruffian, who told us to take the turning to the right\ninstead of to the left. He is the most intolerable scoundrel on the\nface of the earth. His father must have been a most consummate\nvillain, ever to have such a son. I would have had that fellow shot\nwithout the least remorse!\"\n\n\"Did he do it on purpose?\" Mr. Jarndyce inquired.\n\n\"I have not the slightest doubt that the scoundrel has passed his\nwhole existence in misdirecting travellers!\" returned the other. \"By\nmy soul, I thought him the worst-looking dog I had ever beheld when\nhe was telling me to take the turning to the right. And yet I stood\nbefore that fellow face to face and didn't knock his brains out!\"\n\n\"Teeth, you mean?\" said Mr. Jarndyce.\n\n\"Ha, ha, ha!\" laughed Mr. Lawrence Boythorn, really making the whole\nhouse vibrate. \"What, you have not forgotten it yet! Ha, ha, ha! And\nthat was another most consummate vagabond! By my soul, the\ncountenance of that fellow when he was a boy was the blackest image\nof perfidy, cowardice, and cruelty ever set up as a scarecrow in a\nfield of scoundrels. If I were to meet that most unparalleled despot\nin the streets to-morrow, I would fell him like a rotten tree!\"\n\n\"I have no doubt of it,\" said Mr. Jarndyce. \"Now, will you come\nupstairs?\"\n\n\"By my soul, Jarndyce,\" returned his guest, who seemed to refer to\nhis watch, \"if you had been married, I would have turned back at the\ngarden-gate and gone away to the remotest summits of the Himalaya\nMountains sooner than I would have presented myself at this\nunseasonable hour.\"\n\n\"Not quite so far, I hope?\" said Mr. Jarndyce.\n\n\"By my life and honour, yes!\" cried the visitor. \"I wouldn't be\nguilty of the audacious insolence of keeping a lady of the house\nwaiting all this time for any earthly consideration. I would\ninfinitely rather destroy myself--infinitely rather!\"\n\nTalking thus, they went upstairs, and presently we heard him in his\nbedroom thundering \"Ha, ha, ha!\" and again \"Ha, ha, ha!\" until the\nflattest echo in the neighbourhood seemed to catch the contagion and\nto laugh as enjoyingly as he did or as we did when we heard him\nlaugh.\n\nWe all conceived a prepossession in his favour, for there was a\nsterling quality in this laugh, and in his vigorous, healthy voice,\nand in the roundness and fullness with which he uttered every word he\nspoke, and in the very fury of his superlatives, which seemed to go\noff like blank cannons and hurt nothing. But we were hardly prepared\nto have it so confirmed by his appearance when Mr. Jarndyce presented\nhim. He was not only a very handsome old gentleman--upright and\nstalwart as he had been described to us--with a massive grey head, a\nfine composure of face when silent, a figure that might have become\ncorpulent but for his being so continually in earnest that he gave it\nno rest, and a chin that might have subsided into a double chin but\nfor the vehement emphasis in which it was constantly required to\nassist; but he was such a true gentleman in his manner, so\nchivalrously polite, his face was lighted by a smile of so much\nsweetness and tenderness, and it seemed so plain that he had nothing\nto hide, but showed himself exactly as he was--incapable, as Richard\nsaid, of anything on a limited scale, and firing away with those\nblank great guns because he carried no small arms whatever--that\nreally I could not help looking at him with equal pleasure as he sat\nat dinner, whether he smilingly conversed with Ada and me, or was led\nby Mr. Jarndyce into some great volley of superlatives, or threw up\nhis head like a bloodhound and gave out that tremendous \"Ha, ha, ha!\"\n\n\"You have brought your bird with you, I suppose?\" said Mr. Jarndyce.\n\n\"By heaven, he is the most astonishing bird in Europe!\" replied the\nother. \"He IS the most wonderful creature! I wouldn't take ten\nthousand guineas for that bird. I have left an annuity for his sole\nsupport in case he should outlive me. He is, in sense and attachment,\na phenomenon. And his father before him was one of the most\nastonishing birds that ever lived!\"\n\nThe subject of this laudation was a very little canary, who was so\ntame that he was brought down by Mr. Boythorn's man, on his\nforefinger, and after taking a gentle flight round the room, alighted\non his master's head. To hear Mr. Boythorn presently expressing the\nmost implacable and passionate sentiments, with this fragile mite of\na creature quietly perched on his forehead, was to have a good\nillustration of his character, I thought.\n\n\"By my soul, Jarndyce,\" he said, very gently holding up a bit of\nbread to the canary to peck at, \"if I were in your place I would\nseize every master in Chancery by the throat to-morrow morning and\nshake him until his money rolled out of his pockets and his bones\nrattled in his skin. I would have a settlement out of somebody, by\nfair means or by foul. If you would empower me to do it, I would do\nit for you with the greatest satisfaction!\" (All this time the very\nsmall canary was eating out of his hand.)\n\n\"I thank you, Lawrence, but the suit is hardly at such a point at\npresent,\" returned Mr. Jarndyce, laughing, \"that it would be greatly\nadvanced even by the legal process of shaking the bench and the whole\nbar.\"\n\n\"There never was such an infernal cauldron as that Chancery on the\nface of the earth!\" said Mr. Boythorn. \"Nothing but a mine below it\non a busy day in term time, with all its records, rules, and\nprecedents collected in it and every functionary belonging to it\nalso, high and low, upward and downward, from its son the\nAccountant-General to its father the Devil, and the whole blown to\natoms with ten thousand hundredweight of gunpowder, would reform it\nin the least!\"\n\nIt was impossible not to laugh at the energetic gravity with which he\nrecommended this strong measure of reform. When we laughed, he threw\nup his head and shook his broad chest, and again the whole country\nseemed to echo to his \"Ha, ha, ha!\" It had not the least effect in\ndisturbing the bird, whose sense of security was complete and who\nhopped about the table with its quick head now on this side and now\non that, turning its bright sudden eye on its master as if he were no\nmore than another bird.\n\n\"But how do you and your neighbour get on about the disputed right of\nway?\" said Mr. Jarndyce. \"You are not free from the toils of the law\nyourself!\"\n\n\"The fellow has brought actions against ME for trespass, and I have\nbrought actions against HIM for trespass,\" returned Mr. Boythorn. \"By\nheaven, he is the proudest fellow breathing. It is morally impossible\nthat his name can be Sir Leicester. It must be Sir Lucifer.\"\n\n\"Complimentary to our distant relation!\" said my guardian laughingly\nto Ada and Richard.\n\n\"I would beg Miss Clare's pardon and Mr. Carstone's pardon,\" resumed\nour visitor, \"if I were not reassured by seeing in the fair face of\nthe lady and the smile of the gentleman that it is quite unnecessary\nand that they keep their distant relation at a comfortable distance.\"\n\n\"Or he keeps us,\" suggested Richard.\n\n\"By my soul,\" exclaimed Mr. Boythorn, suddenly firing another volley,\n\"that fellow is, and his father was, and his grandfather was, the\nmost stiff-necked, arrogant imbecile, pig-headed numskull, ever, by\nsome inexplicable mistake of Nature, born in any station of life but\na walking-stick's! The whole of that family are the most solemnly\nconceited and consummate blockheads! But it's no matter; he should\nnot shut up my path if he were fifty baronets melted into one and\nliving in a hundred Chesney Wolds, one within another, like the ivory\nballs in a Chinese carving. The fellow, by his agent, or secretary,\nor somebody, writes to me 'Sir Leicester Dedlock, Baronet, presents\nhis compliments to Mr. Lawrence Boythorn, and has to call his\nattention to the fact that the green pathway by the old\nparsonage-house, now the property of Mr. Lawrence Boythorn, is Sir\nLeicester's right of way, being in fact a portion of the park of\nChesney Wold, and that Sir Leicester finds it convenient to close up\nthe same.' I write to the fellow, 'Mr. Lawrence Boythorn presents his\ncompliments to Sir Leicester Dedlock, Baronet, and has to call HIS\nattention to the fact that he totally denies the whole of Sir\nLeicester Dedlock's positions on every possible subject and has to\nadd, in reference to closing up the pathway, that he will be glad to\nsee the man who may undertake to do it.' The fellow sends a most\nabandoned villain with one eye to construct a gateway. I play upon\nthat execrable scoundrel with a fire-engine until the breath is\nnearly driven out of his body. The fellow erects a gate in the night.\nI chop it down and burn it in the morning. He sends his myrmidons to\ncome over the fence and pass and repass. I catch them in humane man\ntraps, fire split peas at their legs, play upon them with the\nengine--resolve to free mankind from the insupportable burden of the\nexistence of those lurking ruffians. He brings actions for trespass;\nI bring actions for trespass. He brings actions for assault and\nbattery; I defend them and continue to assault and batter. Ha, ha,\nha!\"\n\nTo hear him say all this with unimaginable energy, one might have\nthought him the angriest of mankind. To see him at the very same\ntime, looking at the bird now perched upon his thumb and softly\nsmoothing its feathers with his forefinger, one might have thought\nhim the gentlest. To hear him laugh and see the broad good nature of\nhis face then, one might have supposed that he had not a care in the\nworld, or a dispute, or a dislike, but that his whole existence was a\nsummer joke.\n\n\"No, no,\" he said, \"no closing up of my paths by any Dedlock! Though\nI willingly confess,\" here he softened in a moment, \"that Lady\nDedlock is the most accomplished lady in the world, to whom I would\ndo any homage that a plain gentleman, and no baronet with a head\nseven hundred years thick, may. A man who joined his regiment at\ntwenty and within a week challenged the most imperious and\npresumptuous coxcomb of a commanding officer that ever drew the\nbreath of life through a tight waist--and got broke for it--is not\nthe man to be walked over by all the Sir Lucifers, dead or alive,\nlocked or unlocked. Ha, ha, ha!\"\n\n\"Nor the man to allow his junior to be walked over either?\" said my\nguardian.\n\n\"Most assuredly not!\" said Mr. Boythorn, clapping him on the shoulder\nwith an air of protection that had something serious in it, though he\nlaughed. \"He will stand by the low boy, always. Jarndyce, you may\nrely upon him! But speaking of this trespass--with apologies to Miss\nClare and Miss Summerson for the length at which I have pursued so\ndry a subject--is there nothing for me from your men Kenge and\nCarboy?\"\n\n\"I think not, Esther?\" said Mr. Jarndyce.\n\n\"Nothing, guardian.\"\n\n\"Much obliged!\" said Mr. Boythorn. \"Had no need to ask, after even my\nslight experience of Miss Summerson's forethought for every one about\nher.\" (They all encouraged me; they were determined to do it.) \"I\ninquired because, coming from Lincolnshire, I of course have not yet\nbeen in town, and I thought some letters might have been sent down\nhere. I dare say they will report progress to-morrow morning.\"\n\nI saw him so often in the course of the evening, which passed very\npleasantly, contemplate Richard and Ada with an interest and a\nsatisfaction that made his fine face remarkably agreeable as he sat\nat a little distance from the piano listening to the music--and he\nhad small occasion to tell us that he was passionately fond of music,\nfor his face showed it--that I asked my guardian as we sat at the\nbackgammon board whether Mr. Boythorn had ever been married.\n\n\"No,\" said he. \"No.\"\n\n\"But he meant to be!\" said I.\n\n\"How did you find out that?\" he returned with a smile. \"Why,\nguardian,\" I explained, not without reddening a little at hazarding\nwhat was in my thoughts, \"there is something so tender in his manner,\nafter all, and he is so very courtly and gentle to us, and--\"\n\nMr. Jarndyce directed his eyes to where he was sitting as I have just\ndescribed him.\n\nI said no more.\n\n\"You are right, little woman,\" he answered. \"He was all but married\nonce. Long ago. And once.\"\n\n\"Did the lady die?\"\n\n\"No--but she died to him. That time has had its influence on all his\nlater life. Would you suppose him to have a head and a heart full of\nromance yet?\"\n\n\"I think, guardian, I might have supposed so. But it is easy to say\nthat when you have told me so.\"\n\n\"He has never since been what he might have been,\" said Mr. Jarndyce,\n\"and now you see him in his age with no one near him but his servant\nand his little yellow friend. It's your throw, my dear!\"\n\nI felt, from my guardian's manner, that beyond this point I could not\npursue the subject without changing the wind. I therefore forbore to\nask any further questions. I was interested, but not curious. I\nthought a little while about this old love story in the night, when I\nwas awakened by Mr. Boythorn's lusty snoring; and I tried to do that\nvery difficult thing, imagine old people young again and invested\nwith the graces of youth. But I fell asleep before I had succeeded,\nand dreamed of the days when I lived in my godmother's house. I am\nnot sufficiently acquainted with such subjects to know whether it is\nat all remarkable that I almost always dreamed of that period of my\nlife.\n\nWith the morning there came a letter from Messrs. Kenge and Carboy to\nMr. Boythorn informing him that one of their clerks would wait upon\nhim at noon. As it was the day of the week on which I paid the bills,\nand added up my books, and made all the household affairs as compact\nas possible, I remained at home while Mr. Jarndyce, Ada, and Richard\ntook advantage of a very fine day to make a little excursion, Mr.\nBoythorn was to wait for Kenge and Carboy's clerk and then was to go\non foot to meet them on their return.\n\nWell! I was full of business, examining tradesmen's books, adding up\ncolumns, paying money, filing receipts, and I dare say making a great\nbustle about it when Mr. Guppy was announced and shown in. I had had\nsome idea that the clerk who was to be sent down might be the young\ngentleman who had met me at the coach-office, and I was glad to see\nhim, because he was associated with my present happiness.\n\nI scarcely knew him again, he was so uncommonly smart. He had an\nentirely new suit of glossy clothes on, a shining hat, lilac-kid\ngloves, a neckerchief of a variety of colours, a large hot-house\nflower in his button-hole, and a thick gold ring on his little\nfinger. Besides which, he quite scented the dining-room with\nbear's-grease and other perfumery. He looked at me with an attention\nthat quite confused me when I begged him to take a seat until the\nservant should return; and as he sat there crossing and uncrossing\nhis legs in a corner, and I asked him if he had had a pleasant ride,\nand hoped that Mr. Kenge was well, I never looked at him, but I found\nhim looking at me in the same scrutinizing and curious way.\n\nWhen the request was brought to him that he would go upstairs to Mr.\nBoythorn's room, I mentioned that he would find lunch prepared for\nhim when he came down, of which Mr. Jarndyce hoped he would partake.\nHe said with some embarrassment, holding the handle of the door,\n\"Shall I have the honour of finding you here, miss?\" I replied yes, I\nshould be there; and he went out with a bow and another look.\n\nI thought him only awkward and shy, for he was evidently much\nembarrassed; and I fancied that the best thing I could do would be to\nwait until I saw that he had everything he wanted and then to leave\nhim to himself. The lunch was soon brought, but it remained for some\ntime on the table. The interview with Mr. Boythorn was a long one,\nand a stormy one too, I should think, for although his room was at\nsome distance I heard his loud voice rising every now and then like a\nhigh wind, and evidently blowing perfect broadsides of denunciation.\n\nAt last Mr. Guppy came back, looking something the worse for the\nconference. \"My eye, miss,\" he said in a low voice, \"he's a Tartar!\"\n\n\"Pray take some refreshment, sir,\" said I.\n\nMr. Guppy sat down at the table and began nervously sharpening the\ncarving-knife on the carving-fork, still looking at me (as I felt\nquite sure without looking at him) in the same unusual manner. The\nsharpening lasted so long that at last I felt a kind of obligation on\nme to raise my eyes in order that I might break the spell under which\nhe seemed to labour, of not being able to leave off.\n\nHe immediately looked at the dish and began to carve.\n\n\"What will you take yourself, miss? You'll take a morsel of\nsomething?\"\n\n\"No, thank you,\" said I.\n\n\"Shan't I give you a piece of anything at all, miss?\" said Mr. Guppy,\nhurriedly drinking off a glass of wine.\n\n\"Nothing, thank you,\" said I. \"I have only waited to see that you\nhave everything you want. Is there anything I can order for you?\"\n\n\"No, I am much obliged to you, miss, I'm sure. I've everything that I\ncan require to make me comfortable--at least I--not comfortable--I'm\nnever that.\" He drank off two more glasses of wine, one after\nanother.\n\nI thought I had better go.\n\n\"I beg your pardon, miss!\" said Mr. Guppy, rising when he saw me\nrise. \"But would you allow me the favour of a minute's private\nconversation?\"\n\nNot knowing what to say, I sat down again.\n\n\"What follows is without prejudice, miss?\" said Mr. Guppy, anxiously\nbringing a chair towards my table.\n\n\"I don't understand what you mean,\" said I, wondering.\n\n\"It's one of our law terms, miss. You won't make any use of it to my\ndetriment at Kenge and Carboy's or elsewhere. If our conversation\nshouldn't lead to anything, I am to be as I was and am not to be\nprejudiced in my situation or worldly prospects. In short, it's in\ntotal confidence.\"\n\n\"I am at a loss, sir,\" said I, \"to imagine what you can have to\ncommunicate in total confidence to me, whom you have never seen but\nonce; but I should be very sorry to do you any injury.\"\n\n\"Thank you, miss. I'm sure of it--that's quite sufficient.\" All this\ntime Mr. Guppy was either planing his forehead with his handkerchief\nor tightly rubbing the palm of his left hand with the palm of his\nright. \"If you would excuse my taking another glass of wine, miss, I\nthink it might assist me in getting on without a continual choke that\ncannot fail to be mutually unpleasant.\"\n\nHe did so, and came back again. I took the opportunity of moving well\nbehind my table.\n\n\"You wouldn't allow me to offer you one, would you miss?\" said Mr.\nGuppy, apparently refreshed.\n\n\"Not any,\" said I.\n\n\"Not half a glass?\" said Mr. Guppy. \"Quarter? No! Then, to proceed.\nMy present salary, Miss Summerson, at Kenge and Carboy's, is two\npound a week. When I first had the happiness of looking upon you, it\nwas one fifteen, and had stood at that figure for a lengthened\nperiod. A rise of five has since taken place, and a further rise of\nfive is guaranteed at the expiration of a term not exceeding twelve\nmonths from the present date. My mother has a little property, which\ntakes the form of a small life annuity, upon which she lives in an\nindependent though unassuming manner in the Old Street Road. She is\neminently calculated for a mother-in-law. She never interferes, is\nall for peace, and her disposition easy. She has her failings--as who\nhas not?--but I never knew her do it when company was present, at\nwhich time you may freely trust her with wines, spirits, or malt\nliquors. My own abode is lodgings at Penton Place, Pentonville. It is\nlowly, but airy, open at the back, and considered one of the\n'ealthiest outlets. Miss Summerson! In the mildest language, I adore\nyou. Would you be so kind as to allow me (as I may say) to file a\ndeclaration--to make an offer!\"\n\nMr. Guppy went down on his knees. I was well behind my table and not\nmuch frightened. I said, \"Get up from that ridiculous position\nimmediately, sir, or you will oblige me to break my implied promise\nand ring the bell!\"\n\n\"Hear me out, miss!\" said Mr. Guppy, folding his hands.\n\n\"I cannot consent to hear another word, sir,\" I returned, \"Unless you\nget up from the carpet directly and go and sit down at the table as\nyou ought to do if you have any sense at all.\"\n\nHe looked piteously, but slowly rose and did so.\n\n\"Yet what a mockery it is, miss,\" he said with his hand upon his\nheart and shaking his head at me in a melancholy manner over the\ntray, \"to be stationed behind food at such a moment. The soul recoils\nfrom food at such a moment, miss.\"\n\n\"I beg you to conclude,\" said I; \"you have asked me to hear you out,\nand I beg you to conclude.\"\n\n\"I will, miss,\" said Mr. Guppy. \"As I love and honour, so likewise I\nobey. Would that I could make thee the subject of that vow before the\nshrine!\"\n\n\"That is quite impossible,\" said I, \"and entirely out of the\nquestion.\"\n\n\"I am aware,\" said Mr. Guppy, leaning forward over the tray and\nregarding me, as I again strangely felt, though my eyes were not\ndirected to him, with his late intent look, \"I am aware that in a\nworldly point of view, according to all appearances, my offer is a\npoor one. But, Miss Summerson! Angel! No, don't ring--I have been\nbrought up in a sharp school and am accustomed to a variety of\ngeneral practice. Though a young man, I have ferreted out evidence,\ngot up cases, and seen lots of life. Blest with your hand, what means\nmight I not find of advancing your interests and pushing your\nfortunes! What might I not get to know, nearly concerning you? I know\nnothing now, certainly; but what MIGHT I not if I had your\nconfidence, and you set me on?\"\n\nI told him that he addressed my interest or what he supposed to be my\ninterest quite as unsuccessfully as he addressed my inclination, and\nhe would now understand that I requested him, if he pleased, to go\naway immediately.\n\n\"Cruel miss,\" said Mr. Guppy, \"hear but another word! I think you\nmust have seen that I was struck with those charms on the day when I\nwaited at the Whytorseller. I think you must have remarked that I\ncould not forbear a tribute to those charms when I put up the steps\nof the 'ackney-coach. It was a feeble tribute to thee, but it was\nwell meant. Thy image has ever since been fixed in my breast. I have\nwalked up and down of an evening opposite Jellyby's house only to\nlook upon the bricks that once contained thee. This out of to-day,\nquite an unnecessary out so far as the attendance, which was its\npretended object, went, was planned by me alone for thee alone. If I\nspeak of interest, it is only to recommend myself and my respectful\nwretchedness. Love was before it, and is before it.\"\n\n\"I should be pained, Mr. Guppy,\" said I, rising and putting my hand\nupon the bell-rope, \"to do you or any one who was sincere the\ninjustice of slighting any honest feeling, however disagreeably\nexpressed. If you have really meant to give me a proof of your good\nopinion, though ill-timed and misplaced, I feel that I ought to thank\nyou. I have very little reason to be proud, and I am not proud. I\nhope,\" I think I added, without very well knowing what I said, \"that\nyou will now go away as if you had never been so exceedingly foolish\nand attend to Messrs. Kenge and Carboy's business.\"\n\n\"Half a minute, miss!\" cried Mr. Guppy, checking me as I was about to\nring. \"This has been without prejudice?\"\n\n\"I will never mention it,\" said I, \"unless you should give me future\noccasion to do so.\"\n\n\"A quarter of a minute, miss! In case you should think better at any\ntime, however distant--THAT'S no consequence, for my feelings can\nnever alter--of anything I have said, particularly what might I not\ndo, Mr. William Guppy, eighty-seven, Penton Place, or if removed, or\ndead (of blighted hopes or anything of that sort), care of Mrs.\nGuppy, three hundred and two, Old Street Road, will be sufficient.\"\n\nI rang the bell, the servant came, and Mr. Guppy, laying his written\ncard upon the table and making a dejected bow, departed. Raising my\neyes as he went out, I once more saw him looking at me after he had\npassed the door.\n\nI sat there for another hour or more, finishing my books and payments\nand getting through plenty of business. Then I arranged my desk, and\nput everything away, and was so composed and cheerful that I thought\nI had quite dismissed this unexpected incident. But, when I went\nupstairs to my own room, I surprised myself by beginning to laugh\nabout it and then surprised myself still more by beginning to cry\nabout it. In short, I was in a flutter for a little while and felt as\nif an old chord had been more coarsely touched than it ever had been\nsince the days of the dear old doll, long buried in the garden.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X\n\nThe Law-Writer\n\n\nOn the eastern borders of Chancery Lane, that is to say, more\nparticularly in Cook's Court, Cursitor Street, Mr. Snagsby,\nlaw-stationer, pursues his lawful calling. In the shade of Cook's\nCourt, at most times a shady place, Mr. Snagsby has dealt in\nall sorts of blank forms of legal process; in skins and rolls\nof parchment; in paper--foolscap, brief, draft, brown, white,\nwhitey-brown, and blotting; in stamps; in office-quills, pens,\nink, India-rubber, pounce, pins, pencils, sealing-wax, and\nwafers; in red tape and green ferret; in pocket-books, almanacs,\ndiaries, and law lists; in string boxes, rulers, inkstands--glass\nand leaden--pen-knives, scissors, bodkins, and other small\noffice-cutlery; in short, in articles too numerous to mention, ever\nsince he was out of his time and went into partnership with Peffer.\nOn that occasion, Cook's Court was in a manner revolutionized by the\nnew inscription in fresh paint, PEFFER AND SNAGSBY, displacing the\ntime-honoured and not easily to be deciphered legend PEFFER only. For\nsmoke, which is the London ivy, had so wreathed itself round Peffer's\nname and clung to his dwelling-place that the affectionate parasite\nquite overpowered the parent tree.\n\nPeffer is never seen in Cook's Court now. He is not expected there,\nfor he has been recumbent this quarter of a century in the churchyard\nof St. Andrews, Holborn, with the waggons and hackney-coaches roaring\npast him all the day and half the night like one great dragon. If he\never steal forth when the dragon is at rest to air himself again in\nCook's Court until admonished to return by the crowing of the\nsanguine cock in the cellar at the little dairy in Cursitor Street,\nwhose ideas of daylight it would be curious to ascertain, since he\nknows from his personal observation next to nothing about it--if\nPeffer ever do revisit the pale glimpses of Cook's Court, which no\nlaw-stationer in the trade can positively deny, he comes invisibly,\nand no one is the worse or wiser.\n\nIn his lifetime, and likewise in the period of Snagsby's \"time\"\nof seven long years, there dwelt with Peffer in the same\nlaw-stationering premises a niece--a short, shrewd niece, something\ntoo violently compressed about the waist, and with a sharp nose like\na sharp autumn evening, inclining to be frosty towards the end. The\nCook's Courtiers had a rumour flying among them that the mother of\nthis niece did, in her daughter's childhood, moved by too jealous a\nsolicitude that her figure should approach perfection, lace her\nup every morning with her maternal foot against the bed-post for\na stronger hold and purchase; and further, that she exhibited\ninternally pints of vinegar and lemon-juice, which acids, they held,\nhad mounted to the nose and temper of the patient. With whichsoever\nof the many tongues of Rumour this frothy report originated, it\neither never reached or never influenced the ears of young Snagsby,\nwho, having wooed and won its fair subject on his arrival at man's\nestate, entered into two partnerships at once. So now, in Cook's\nCourt, Cursitor Street, Mr. Snagsby and the niece are one; and the\nniece still cherishes her figure, which, however tastes may differ,\nis unquestionably so far precious that there is mighty little of it.\n\nMr. and Mrs. Snagsby are not only one bone and one flesh, but, to the\nneighbours' thinking, one voice too. That voice, appearing to proceed\nfrom Mrs. Snagsby alone, is heard in Cook's Court very often. Mr.\nSnagsby, otherwise than as he finds expression through these dulcet\ntones, is rarely heard. He is a mild, bald, timid man with a shining\nhead and a scrubby clump of black hair sticking out at the back. He\ntends to meekness and obesity. As he stands at his door in Cook's\nCourt in his grey shop-coat and black calico sleeves, looking up at\nthe clouds, or stands behind a desk in his dark shop with a heavy\nflat ruler, snipping and slicing at sheepskin in company with his two\n'prentices, he is emphatically a retiring and unassuming man. From\nbeneath his feet, at such times, as from a shrill ghost unquiet in\nits grave, there frequently arise complainings and lamentations in\nthe voice already mentioned; and haply, on some occasions when these\nreach a sharper pitch than usual, Mr. Snagsby mentions to the\n'prentices, \"I think my little woman is a-giving it to Guster!\"\n\nThis proper name, so used by Mr. Snagsby, has before now sharpened\nthe wit of the Cook's Courtiers to remark that it ought to be the\nname of Mrs. Snagsby, seeing that she might with great force and\nexpression be termed a Guster, in compliment to her stormy character.\nIt is, however, the possession, and the only possession except fifty\nshillings per annum and a very small box indifferently filled with\nclothing, of a lean young woman from a workhouse (by some supposed to\nhave been christened Augusta) who, although she was farmed or\ncontracted for during her growing time by an amiable benefactor of\nhis species resident at Tooting, and cannot fail to have been\ndeveloped under the most favourable circumstances, \"has fits,\" which\nthe parish can't account for.\n\nGuster, really aged three or four and twenty, but looking a round ten\nyears older, goes cheap with this unaccountable drawback of fits, and\nis so apprehensive of being returned on the hands of her patron saint\nthat except when she is found with her head in the pail, or the sink,\nor the copper, or the dinner, or anything else that happens to be\nnear her at the time of her seizure, she is always at work. She is a\nsatisfaction to the parents and guardians of the 'prentices, who feel\nthat there is little danger of her inspiring tender emotions in the\nbreast of youth; she is a satisfaction to Mrs. Snagsby, who can\nalways find fault with her; she is a satisfaction to Mr. Snagsby, who\nthinks it a charity to keep her. The law-stationer's establishment\nis, in Guster's eyes, a temple of plenty and splendour. She believes\nthe little drawing-room upstairs, always kept, as one may say, with\nits hair in papers and its pinafore on, to be the most elegant\napartment in Christendom. The view it commands of Cook's Court at one\nend (not to mention a squint into Cursitor Street) and of Coavinses'\nthe sheriff's officer's backyard at the other she regards as a\nprospect of unequalled beauty. The portraits it displays in oil--and\nplenty of it too--of Mr. Snagsby looking at Mrs. Snagsby and of Mrs.\nSnagsby looking at Mr. Snagsby are in her eyes as achievements of\nRaphael or Titian. Guster has some recompenses for her many\nprivations.\n\nMr. Snagsby refers everything not in the practical mysteries of the\nbusiness to Mrs. Snagsby. She manages the money, reproaches the\ntax-gatherers, appoints the times and places of devotion on Sundays,\nlicenses Mr. Snagsby's entertainments, and acknowledges no\nresponsibility as to what she thinks fit to provide for dinner,\ninsomuch that she is the high standard of comparison among the\nneighbouring wives a long way down Chancery Lane on both sides, and\neven out in Holborn, who in any domestic passages of arms habitually\ncall upon their husbands to look at the difference between their (the\nwives') position and Mrs. Snagsby's, and their (the husbands')\nbehaviour and Mr. Snagsby's. Rumour, always flying bat-like about\nCook's Court and skimming in and out at everybody's windows, does say\nthat Mrs. Snagsby is jealous and inquisitive and that Mr. Snagsby is\nsometimes worried out of house and home, and that if he had the\nspirit of a mouse he wouldn't stand it. It is even observed that the\nwives who quote him to their self-willed husbands as a shining\nexample in reality look down upon him and that nobody does so with\ngreater superciliousness than one particular lady whose lord is more\nthan suspected of laying his umbrella on her as an instrument of\ncorrection. But these vague whisperings may arise from Mr. Snagsby's\nbeing in his way rather a meditative and poetical man, loving to walk\nin Staple Inn in the summer-time and to observe how countrified the\nsparrows and the leaves are, also to lounge about the Rolls Yard of a\nSunday afternoon and to remark (if in good spirits) that there were\nold times once and that you'd find a stone coffin or two now under\nthat chapel, he'll be bound, if you was to dig for it. He solaces his\nimagination, too, by thinking of the many Chancellors and Vices, and\nMasters of the Rolls who are deceased; and he gets such a flavour of\nthe country out of telling the two 'prentices how he HAS heard say\nthat a brook \"as clear as crystial\" once ran right down the middle of\nHolborn, when Turnstile really was a turnstile, leading slap away\ninto the meadows--gets such a flavour of the country out of this that\nhe never wants to go there.\n\nThe day is closing in and the gas is lighted, but is not yet fully\neffective, for it is not quite dark. Mr. Snagsby standing at his\nshop-door looking up at the clouds sees a crow who is out late skim\nwestward over the slice of sky belonging to Cook's Court. The crow\nflies straight across Chancery Lane and Lincoln's Inn Garden into\nLincoln's Inn Fields.\n\nHere, in a large house, formerly a house of state, lives Mr.\nTulkinghorn. It is let off in sets of chambers now, and in those\nshrunken fragments of its greatness, lawyers lie like maggots in\nnuts. But its roomy staircases, passages, and antechambers still\nremain; and even its painted ceilings, where Allegory, in Roman\nhelmet and celestial linen, sprawls among balustrades and pillars,\nflowers, clouds, and big-legged boys, and makes the head ache--as\nwould seem to be Allegory's object always, more or less. Here, among\nhis many boxes labelled with transcendent names, lives Mr.\nTulkinghorn, when not speechlessly at home in country-houses where\nthe great ones of the earth are bored to death. Here he is to-day,\nquiet at his table. An oyster of the old school whom nobody can open.\n\nLike as he is to look at, so is his apartment in the dusk of\nthe present afternoon. Rusty, out of date, withdrawing from\nattention, able to afford it. Heavy, broad-backed, old-fashioned,\nmahogany-and-horsehair chairs, not easily lifted; obsolete tables\nwith spindle-legs and dusty baize covers; presentation prints of the\nholders of great titles in the last generation or the last but one,\nenviron him. A thick and dingy Turkey-carpet muffles the floor where\nhe sits, attended by two candles in old-fashioned silver candlesticks\nthat give a very insufficient light to his large room. The titles on\nthe backs of his books have retired into the binding; everything that\ncan have a lock has got one; no key is visible. Very few loose papers\nare about. He has some manuscript near him, but is not referring\nto it. With the round top of an inkstand and two broken bits of\nsealing-wax he is silently and slowly working out whatever train of\nindecision is in his mind. Now the inkstand top is in the middle, now\nthe red bit of sealing-wax, now the black bit. That's not it. Mr.\nTulkinghorn must gather them all up and begin again.\n\nHere, beneath the painted ceiling, with foreshortened Allegory\nstaring down at his intrusion as if it meant to swoop upon him, and\nhe cutting it dead, Mr. Tulkinghorn has at once his house and office.\nHe keeps no staff, only one middle-aged man, usually a little out at\nelbows, who sits in a high pew in the hall and is rarely overburdened\nwith business. Mr. Tulkinghorn is not in a common way. He wants no\nclerks. He is a great reservoir of confidences, not to be so tapped.\nHis clients want HIM; he is all in all. Drafts that he requires to be\ndrawn are drawn by special-pleaders in the temple on mysterious\ninstructions; fair copies that he requires to be made are made at the\nstationers', expense being no consideration. The middle-aged man in\nthe pew knows scarcely more of the affairs of the peerage than any\ncrossing-sweeper in Holborn.\n\nThe red bit, the black bit, the inkstand top, the other inkstand top,\nthe little sand-box. So! You to the middle, you to the right, you to\nthe left. This train of indecision must surely be worked out now or\nnever. Now! Mr. Tulkinghorn gets up, adjusts his spectacles, puts on\nhis hat, puts the manuscript in his pocket, goes out, tells the\nmiddle-aged man out at elbows, \"I shall be back presently.\" Very\nrarely tells him anything more explicit.\n\nMr. Tulkinghorn goes, as the crow came--not quite so straight, but\nnearly--to Cook's Court, Cursitor Street. To Snagsby's,\nLaw-Stationer's, Deeds engrossed and copied, Law-Writing executed in\nall its branches, &c., &c., &c.\n\nIt is somewhere about five or six o'clock in the afternoon, and a\nbalmy fragrance of warm tea hovers in Cook's Court. It hovers about\nSnagsby's door. The hours are early there: dinner at half-past one\nand supper at half-past nine. Mr. Snagsby was about to descend into\nthe subterranean regions to take tea when he looked out of his door\njust now and saw the crow who was out late.\n\n\"Master at home?\"\n\nGuster is minding the shop, for the 'prentices take tea in the\nkitchen with Mr. and Mrs. Snagsby; consequently, the robe-maker's two\ndaughters, combing their curls at the two glasses in the two\nsecond-floor windows of the opposite house, are not driving the two\n'prentices to distraction as they fondly suppose, but are merely\nawakening the unprofitable admiration of Guster, whose hair won't\ngrow, and never would, and it is confidently thought, never will.\n\n\"Master at home?\" says Mr. Tulkinghorn.\n\nMaster is at home, and Guster will fetch him. Guster disappears, glad\nto get out of the shop, which she regards with mingled dread and\nveneration as a storehouse of awful implements of the great torture\nof the law--a place not to be entered after the gas is turned off.\n\nMr. Snagsby appears, greasy, warm, herbaceous, and chewing. Bolts a\nbit of bread and butter. Says, \"Bless my soul, sir! Mr. Tulkinghorn!\"\n\n\"I want half a word with you, Snagsby.\"\n\n\"Certainly, sir! Dear me, sir, why didn't you send your young man\nround for me? Pray walk into the back shop, sir.\" Snagsby has\nbrightened in a moment.\n\nThe confined room, strong of parchment-grease, is warehouse,\ncounting-house, and copying-office. Mr. Tulkinghorn sits, facing\nround, on a stool at the desk.\n\n\"Jarndyce and Jarndyce, Snagsby.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\" Mr. Snagsby turns up the gas and coughs behind his hand,\nmodestly anticipating profit. Mr. Snagsby, as a timid man, is\naccustomed to cough with a variety of expressions, and so to save\nwords.\n\n\"You copied some affidavits in that cause for me lately.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir, we did.\"\n\n\"There was one of them,\" says Mr. Tulkinghorn, carelessly\nfeeling--tight, unopenable oyster of the old school!--in the wrong\ncoat-pocket, \"the handwriting of which is peculiar, and I rather\nlike. As I happened to be passing, and thought I had it about me, I\nlooked in to ask you--but I haven't got it. No matter, any other time\nwill do. Ah! here it is! I looked in to ask you who copied this.\"\n\n\"Who copied this, sir?\" says Mr. Snagsby, taking it, laying it flat\non the desk, and separating all the sheets at once with a twirl and a\ntwist of the left hand peculiar to lawstationers. \"We gave this out,\nsir. We were giving out rather a large quantity of work just at that\ntime. I can tell you in a moment who copied it, sir, by referring to\nmy book.\"\n\nMr. Snagsby takes his book down from the safe, makes another bolt of\nthe bit of bread and butter which seemed to have stopped short, eyes\nthe affidavit aside, and brings his right forefinger travelling down\na page of the book, \"Jewby--Packer--Jarndyce.\"\n\n\"Jarndyce! Here we are, sir,\" says Mr. Snagsby. \"To be sure! I might\nhave remembered it. This was given out, sir, to a writer who lodges\njust over on the opposite side of the lane.\"\n\nMr. Tulkinghorn has seen the entry, found it before the\nlaw-stationer, read it while the forefinger was coming down the hill.\n\n\"WHAT do you call him? Nemo?\" says Mr. Tulkinghorn. \"Nemo, sir. Here\nit is. Forty-two folio. Given out on the Wednesday night at eight\no'clock, brought in on the Thursday morning at half after nine.\"\n\n\"Nemo!\" repeats Mr. Tulkinghorn. \"Nemo is Latin for no one.\"\n\n\"It must be English for some one, sir, I think,\" Mr. Snagsby submits\nwith his deferential cough. \"It is a person's name. Here it is, you\nsee, sir! Forty-two folio. Given out Wednesday night, eight o'clock;\nbrought in Thursday morning, half after nine.\"\n\nThe tail of Mr. Snagsby's eye becomes conscious of the head of Mrs.\nSnagsby looking in at the shop-door to know what he means by\ndeserting his tea. Mr. Snagsby addresses an explanatory cough to Mrs.\nSnagsby, as who should say, \"My dear, a customer!\"\n\n\"Half after nine, sir,\" repeats Mr. Snagsby. \"Our law-writers, who\nlive by job-work, are a queer lot; and this may not be his name, but\nit's the name he goes by. I remember now, sir, that he gives it in a\nwritten advertisement he sticks up down at the Rule Office, and the\nKing's Bench Office, and the Judges' Chambers, and so forth. You know\nthe kind of document, sir--wanting employ?\"\n\nMr. Tulkinghorn glances through the little window at the back of\nCoavinses', the sheriff's officer's, where lights shine in Coavinses'\nwindows. Coavinses' coffee-room is at the back, and the shadows of\nseveral gentlemen under a cloud loom cloudily upon the blinds. Mr.\nSnagsby takes the opportunity of slightly turning his head to glance\nover his shoulder at his little woman and to make apologetic motions\nwith his mouth to this effect: \"Tul-king-horn--rich--in-flu-en-tial!\"\n\n\"Have you given this man work before?\" asks Mr. Tulkinghorn.\n\n\"Oh, dear, yes, sir! Work of yours.\"\n\n\"Thinking of more important matters, I forget where you said he\nlived?\"\n\n\"Across the lane, sir. In fact, he lodges at a--\" Mr. Snagsby makes\nanother bolt, as if the bit of bread and buffer were insurmountable\n\"--at a rag and bottle shop.\"\n\n\"Can you show me the place as I go back?\"\n\n\"With the greatest pleasure, sir!\"\n\nMr. Snagsby pulls off his sleeves and his grey coat, pulls on his\nblack coat, takes his hat from its peg. \"Oh! Here is my little\nwoman!\" he says aloud. \"My dear, will you be so kind as to tell one\nof the lads to look after the shop while I step across the lane with\nMr. Tulkinghorn? Mrs. Snagsby, sir--I shan't be two minutes, my\nlove!\"\n\nMrs. Snagsby bends to the lawyer, retires behind the counter, peeps\nat them through the window-blind, goes softly into the back office,\nrefers to the entries in the book still lying open. Is evidently\ncurious.\n\n\"You will find that the place is rough, sir,\" says Mr. Snagsby,\nwalking deferentially in the road and leaving the narrow pavement to\nthe lawyer; \"and the party is very rough. But they're a wild lot in\ngeneral, sir. The advantage of this particular man is that he never\nwants sleep. He'll go at it right on end if you want him to, as long\nas ever you like.\"\n\nIt is quite dark now, and the gas-lamps have acquired their full\neffect. Jostling against clerks going to post the day's letters, and\nagainst counsel and attorneys going home to dinner, and against\nplaintiffs and defendants and suitors of all sorts, and against the\ngeneral crowd, in whose way the forensic wisdom of ages has\ninterposed a million of obstacles to the transaction of the commonest\nbusiness of life; diving through law and equity, and through that\nkindred mystery, the street mud, which is made of nobody knows what\nand collects about us nobody knows whence or how--we only knowing in\ngeneral that when there is too much of it we find it necessary to\nshovel it away--the lawyer and the law-stationer come to a rag and\nbottle shop and general emporium of much disregarded merchandise,\nlying and being in the shadow of the wall of Lincoln's Inn, and kept,\nas is announced in paint, to all whom it may concern, by one Krook.\n\n\"This is where he lives, sir,\" says the law-stationer.\n\n\"This is where he lives, is it?\" says the lawyer unconcernedly.\n\"Thank you.\"\n\n\"Are you not going in, sir?\"\n\n\"No, thank you, no; I am going on to the Fields at present. Good\nevening. Thank you!\" Mr. Snagsby lifts his hat and returns to his\nlittle woman and his tea.\n\nBut Mr. Tulkinghorn does not go on to the Fields at present. He goes\na short way, turns back, comes again to the shop of Mr. Krook, and\nenters it straight. It is dim enough, with a blot-headed candle or so\nin the windows, and an old man and a cat sitting in the back part by\na fire. The old man rises and comes forward, with another blot-headed\ncandle in his hand.\n\n\"Pray is your lodger within?\"\n\n\"Male or female, sir?\" says Mr. Krook.\n\n\"Male. The person who does copying.\"\n\nMr. Krook has eyed his man narrowly. Knows him by sight. Has an\nindistinct impression of his aristocratic repute.\n\n\"Did you wish to see him, sir?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"It's what I seldom do myself,\" says Mr. Krook with a grin. \"Shall I\ncall him down? But it's a weak chance if he'd come, sir!\"\n\n\"I'll go up to him, then,\" says Mr. Tulkinghorn.\n\n\"Second floor, sir. Take the candle. Up there!\" Mr. Krook, with his\ncat beside him, stands at the bottom of the staircase, looking after\nMr. Tulkinghorn. \"Hi-hi!\" he says when Mr. Tulkinghorn has nearly\ndisappeared. The lawyer looks down over the hand-rail. The cat\nexpands her wicked mouth and snarls at him.\n\n\"Order, Lady Jane! Behave yourself to visitors, my lady! You know\nwhat they say of my lodger?\" whispers Krook, going up a step or two.\n\n\"What do they say of him?\"\n\n\"They say he has sold himself to the enemy, but you and I know\nbetter--he don't buy. I'll tell you what, though; my lodger is so\nblack-humoured and gloomy that I believe he'd as soon make that\nbargain as any other. Don't put him out, sir. That's my advice!\"\n\nMr. Tulkinghorn with a nod goes on his way. He comes to the dark door\non the second floor. He knocks, receives no answer, opens it, and\naccidentally extinguishes his candle in doing so.\n\nThe air of the room is almost bad enough to have extinguished it if\nhe had not. It is a small room, nearly black with soot, and grease,\nand dirt. In the rusty skeleton of a grate, pinched at the middle as\nif poverty had gripped it, a red coke fire burns low. In the corner\nby the chimney stand a deal table and a broken desk, a wilderness\nmarked with a rain of ink. In another corner a ragged old portmanteau\non one of the two chairs serves for cabinet or wardrobe; no larger\none is needed, for it collapses like the cheeks of a starved man. The\nfloor is bare, except that one old mat, trodden to shreds of\nrope-yarn, lies perishing upon the hearth. No curtain veils the\ndarkness of the night, but the discoloured shutters are drawn\ntogether, and through the two gaunt holes pierced in them, famine\nmight be staring in--the banshee of the man upon the bed.\n\nFor, on a low bed opposite the fire, a confusion of dirty patchwork,\nlean-ribbed ticking, and coarse sacking, the lawyer, hesitating just\nwithin the doorway, sees a man. He lies there, dressed in shirt and\ntrousers, with bare feet. He has a yellow look in the spectral\ndarkness of a candle that has guttered down until the whole length of\nits wick (still burning) has doubled over and left a tower of\nwinding-sheet above it. His hair is ragged, mingling with his\nwhiskers and his beard--the latter, ragged too, and grown, like the\nscum and mist around him, in neglect. Foul and filthy as the room is,\nfoul and filthy as the air is, it is not easy to perceive what fumes\nthose are which most oppress the senses in it; but through the\ngeneral sickliness and faintness, and the odour of stale tobacco,\nthere comes into the lawyer's mouth the bitter, vapid taste of opium.\n\n\"Hallo, my friend!\" he cries, and strikes his iron candlestick\nagainst the door.\n\nHe thinks he has awakened his friend. He lies a little turned away,\nbut his eyes are surely open.\n\n\"Hallo, my friend!\" he cries again. \"Hallo! Hallo!\"\n\nAs he rattles on the door, the candle which has drooped so long goes\nout and leaves him in the dark, with the gaunt eyes in the shutters\nstaring down upon the bed.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI\n\nOur Dear Brother\n\n\nA touch on the lawyer's wrinkled hand as he stands in the dark room,\nirresolute, makes him start and say, \"What's that?\"\n\n\"It's me,\" returns the old man of the house, whose breath is in his\near. \"Can't you wake him?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"What have you done with your candle?\"\n\n\"It's gone out. Here it is.\"\n\nKrook takes it, goes to the fire, stoops over the red embers, and\ntries to get a light. The dying ashes have no light to spare, and his\nendeavours are vain. Muttering, after an ineffectual call to his\nlodger, that he will go downstairs and bring a lighted candle from\nthe shop, the old man departs. Mr. Tulkinghorn, for some new reason\nthat he has, does not await his return in the room, but on the stairs\noutside.\n\nThe welcome light soon shines upon the wall, as Krook comes slowly up\nwith his green-eyed cat following at his heels. \"Does the man\ngenerally sleep like this?\" inquired the lawyer in a low voice. \"Hi!\nI don't know,\" says Krook, shaking his head and lifting his eyebrows.\n\"I know next to nothing of his habits except that he keeps himself\nvery close.\"\n\nThus whispering, they both go in together. As the light goes in, the\ngreat eyes in the shutters, darkening, seem to close. Not so the eyes\nupon the bed.\n\n\"God save us!\" exclaims Mr. Tulkinghorn. \"He is dead!\" Krook drops\nthe heavy hand he has taken up so suddenly that the arm swings over\nthe bedside.\n\nThey look at one another for a moment.\n\n\"Send for some doctor! Call for Miss Flite up the stairs, sir. Here's\npoison by the bed! Call out for Flite, will you?\" says Krook, with\nhis lean hands spread out above the body like a vampire's wings.\n\nMr. Tulkinghorn hurries to the landing and calls, \"Miss Flite! Flite!\nMake haste, here, whoever you are! Flite!\" Krook follows him with his\neyes, and while he is calling, finds opportunity to steal to the old\nportmanteau and steal back again.\n\n\"Run, Flite, run! The nearest doctor! Run!\" So Mr. Krook addresses a\ncrazy little woman who is his female lodger, who appears and vanishes\nin a breath, who soon returns accompanied by a testy medical man\nbrought from his dinner, with a broad, snuffy upper lip and a broad\nScotch tongue.\n\n\"Ey! Bless the hearts o' ye,\" says the medical man, looking up at\nthem after a moment's examination. \"He's just as dead as Phairy!\"\n\nMr. Tulkinghorn (standing by the old portmanteau) inquires if he has\nbeen dead any time.\n\n\"Any time, sir?\" says the medical gentleman. \"It's probable he wull\nhave been dead aboot three hours.\"\n\n\"About that time, I should say,\" observes a dark young man on the\nother side of the bed.\n\n\"Air you in the maydickle prayfession yourself, sir?\" inquires the\nfirst.\n\nThe dark young man says yes.\n\n\"Then I'll just tak' my depairture,\" replies the other, \"for I'm nae\ngude here!\" With which remark he finishes his brief attendance and\nreturns to finish his dinner.\n\nThe dark young surgeon passes the candle across and across the face\nand carefully examines the law-writer, who has established his\npretensions to his name by becoming indeed No one.\n\n\"I knew this person by sight very well,\" says he. \"He has purchased\nopium of me for the last year and a half. Was anybody present related\nto him?\" glancing round upon the three bystanders.\n\n\"I was his landlord,\" grimly answers Krook, taking the candle from\nthe surgeon's outstretched hand. \"He told me once I was the nearest\nrelation he had.\"\n\n\"He has died,\" says the surgeon, \"of an over-dose of opium, there is\nno doubt. The room is strongly flavoured with it. There is enough\nhere now,\" taking an old tea-pot from Mr. Krook, \"to kill a dozen\npeople.\"\n\n\"Do you think he did it on purpose?\" asks Krook.\n\n\"Took the over-dose?\"\n\n\"Yes!\" Krook almost smacks his lips with the unction of a horrible\ninterest.\n\n\"I can't say. I should think it unlikely, as he has been in the habit\nof taking so much. But nobody can tell. He was very poor, I suppose?\"\n\n\"I suppose he was. His room--don't look rich,\" says Krook, who might\nhave changed eyes with his cat, as he casts his sharp glance around.\n\"But I have never been in it since he had it, and he was too close to\nname his circumstances to me.\"\n\n\"Did he owe you any rent?\"\n\n\"Six weeks.\"\n\n\"He will never pay it!\" says the young man, resuming his examination.\n\"It is beyond a doubt that he is indeed as dead as Pharaoh; and to\njudge from his appearance and condition, I should think it a happy\nrelease. Yet he must have been a good figure when a youth, and I dare\nsay, good-looking.\" He says this, not unfeelingly, while sitting on\nthe bedstead's edge with his face towards that other face and his\nhand upon the region of the heart. \"I recollect once thinking there\nwas something in his manner, uncouth as it was, that denoted a fall\nin life. Was that so?\" he continues, looking round.\n\nKrook replies, \"You might as well ask me to describe the ladies whose\nheads of hair I have got in sacks downstairs. Than that he was my\nlodger for a year and a half and lived--or didn't live--by\nlaw-writing, I know no more of him.\"\n\nDuring this dialogue Mr. Tulkinghorn has stood aloof by the old\nportmanteau, with his hands behind him, equally removed, to all\nappearance, from all three kinds of interest exhibited near the\nbed--from the young surgeon's professional interest in death,\nnoticeable as being quite apart from his remarks on the deceased as\nan individual; from the old man's unction; and the little crazy\nwoman's awe. His imperturbable face has been as inexpressive as his\nrusty clothes. One could not even say he has been thinking all this\nwhile. He has shown neither patience nor impatience, nor attention\nnor abstraction. He has shown nothing but his shell. As easily might\nthe tone of a delicate musical instrument be inferred from its case,\nas the tone of Mr. Tulkinghorn from his case.\n\nHe now interposes, addressing the young surgeon in his unmoved,\nprofessional way.\n\n\"I looked in here,\" he observes, \"just before you, with the\nintention of giving this deceased man, whom I never saw alive, some\nemployment at his trade of copying. I had heard of him from my\nstationer--Snagsby of Cook's Court. Since no one here knows anything\nabout him, it might be as well to send for Snagsby. Ah!\" to the\nlittle crazy woman, who has often seen him in court, and whom he has\noften seen, and who proposes, in frightened dumb-show, to go for the\nlaw-stationer. \"Suppose you do!\"\n\nWhile she is gone, the surgeon abandons his hopeless investigation\nand covers its subject with the patchwork counterpane. Mr. Krook and\nhe interchange a word or two. Mr. Tulkinghorn says nothing, but\nstands, ever, near the old portmanteau.\n\nMr. Snagsby arrives hastily in his grey coat and his black sleeves.\n\"Dear me, dear me,\" he says; \"and it has come to this, has it! Bless\nmy soul!\"\n\n\"Can you give the person of the house any information about this\nunfortunate creature, Snagsby?\" inquires Mr. Tulkinghorn. \"He was in\narrears with his rent, it seems. And he must be buried, you know.\"\n\n\"Well, sir,\" says Mr. Snagsby, coughing his apologetic cough behind\nhis hand, \"I really don't know what advice I could offer, except\nsending for the beadle.\"\n\n\"I don't speak of advice,\" returns Mr. Tulkinghorn. \"I could\nadvise--\"\n\n\"No one better, sir, I am sure,\" says Mr. Snagsby, with his\ndeferential cough.\n\n\"I speak of affording some clue to his connexions, or to where he\ncame from, or to anything concerning him.\"\n\n\"I assure you, sir,\" says Mr. Snagsby after prefacing his reply with\nhis cough of general propitiation, \"that I no more know where he came\nfrom than I know--\"\n\n\"Where he has gone to, perhaps,\" suggests the surgeon to help him\nout.\n\nA pause. Mr. Tulkinghorn looking at the law-stationer. Mr. Krook,\nwith his mouth open, looking for somebody to speak next.\n\n\"As to his connexions, sir,\" says Mr. Snagsby, \"if a person was to\nsay to me, 'Snagsby, here's twenty thousand pound down, ready for you\nin the Bank of England if you'll only name one of 'em,' I couldn't do\nit, sir! About a year and a half ago--to the best of my belief, at\nthe time when he first came to lodge at the present rag and bottle\nshop--\"\n\n\"That was the time!\" says Krook with a nod.\n\n\"About a year and a half ago,\" says Mr. Snagsby, strengthened, \"he\ncame into our place one morning after breakfast, and finding my\nlittle woman (which I name Mrs. Snagsby when I use that appellation)\nin our shop, produced a specimen of his handwriting and gave her to\nunderstand that he was in want of copying work to do and was, not to\nput too fine a point upon it,\" a favourite apology for plain speaking\nwith Mr. Snagsby, which he always offers with a sort of argumentative\nfrankness, \"hard up! My little woman is not in general partial to\nstrangers, particular--not to put too fine a point upon it--when they\nwant anything. But she was rather took by something about this\nperson, whether by his being unshaved, or by his hair being in want\nof attention, or by what other ladies' reasons, I leave you to judge;\nand she accepted of the specimen, and likewise of the address. My\nlittle woman hasn't a good ear for names,\" proceeds Mr. Snagsby after\nconsulting his cough of consideration behind his hand, \"and she\nconsidered Nemo equally the same as Nimrod. In consequence of which,\nshe got into a habit of saying to me at meals, 'Mr. Snagsby, you\nhaven't found Nimrod any work yet!' or 'Mr. Snagsby, why didn't you\ngive that eight and thirty Chancery folio in Jarndyce to Nimrod?' or\nsuch like. And that is the way he gradually fell into job-work at our\nplace; and that is the most I know of him except that he was a quick\nhand, and a hand not sparing of night-work, and that if you gave him\nout, say, five and forty folio on the Wednesday night, you would have\nit brought in on the Thursday morning. All of which--\" Mr. Snagsby\nconcludes by politely motioning with his hat towards the bed, as much\nas to add, \"I have no doubt my honourable friend would confirm if he\nwere in a condition to do it.\"\n\n\"Hadn't you better see,\" says Mr. Tulkinghorn to Krook, \"whether he\nhad any papers that may enlighten you? There will be an inquest, and\nyou will be asked the question. You can read?\"\n\n\"No, I can't,\" returns the old man with a sudden grin.\n\n\"Snagsby,\" says Mr. Tulkinghorn, \"look over the room for him. He will\nget into some trouble or difficulty otherwise. Being here, I'll wait\nif you make haste, and then I can testify on his behalf, if it should\never be necessary, that all was fair and right. If you will hold the\ncandle for Mr. Snagsby, my friend, he'll soon see whether there is\nanything to help you.\"\n\n\"In the first place, here's an old portmanteau, sir,\" says Snagsby.\n\nAh, to be sure, so there is! Mr. Tulkinghorn does not appear to have\nseen it before, though he is standing so close to it, and though\nthere is very little else, heaven knows.\n\nThe marine-store merchant holds the light, and the law-stationer\nconducts the search. The surgeon leans against the corner of the\nchimney-piece; Miss Flite peeps and trembles just within the door.\nThe apt old scholar of the old school, with his dull black breeches\ntied with ribbons at the knees, his large black waistcoat, his\nlong-sleeved black coat, and his wisp of limp white neckerchief tied\nin the bow the peerage knows so well, stands in exactly the same\nplace and attitude.\n\nThere are some worthless articles of clothing in the old portmanteau;\nthere is a bundle of pawnbrokers' duplicates, those turnpike tickets\non the road of poverty; there is a crumpled paper, smelling of opium,\non which are scrawled rough memoranda--as, took, such a day, so many\ngrains; took, such another day, so many more--begun some time ago, as\nif with the intention of being regularly continued, but soon left\noff. There are a few dirty scraps of newspapers, all referring to\ncoroners' inquests; there is nothing else. They search the cupboard\nand the drawer of the ink-splashed table. There is not a morsel of an\nold letter or of any other writing in either. The young surgeon\nexamines the dress on the law-writer. A knife and some odd halfpence\nare all he finds. Mr. Snagsby's suggestion is the practical\nsuggestion after all, and the beadle must be called in.\n\nSo the little crazy lodger goes for the beadle, and the rest come out\nof the room. \"Don't leave the cat there!\" says the surgeon; \"that\nwon't do!\" Mr. Krook therefore drives her out before him, and she\ngoes furtively downstairs, winding her lithe tail and licking her\nlips.\n\n\"Good night!\" says Mr. Tulkinghorn, and goes home to Allegory and\nmeditation.\n\nBy this time the news has got into the court. Groups of its\ninhabitants assemble to discuss the thing, and the outposts of the\narmy of observation (principally boys) are pushed forward to Mr.\nKrook's window, which they closely invest. A policeman has already\nwalked up to the room, and walked down again to the door, where he\nstands like a tower, only condescending to see the boys at his base\noccasionally; but whenever he does see them, they quail and fall\nback. Mrs. Perkins, who has not been for some weeks on speaking terms\nwith Mrs. Piper in consequence for an unpleasantness originating in\nyoung Perkins' having \"fetched\" young Piper \"a crack,\" renews her\nfriendly intercourse on this auspicious occasion. The potboy at the\ncorner, who is a privileged amateur, as possessing official knowledge\nof life and having to deal with drunken men occasionally, exchanges\nconfidential communications with the policeman and has the appearance\nof an impregnable youth, unassailable by truncheons and unconfinable\nin station-houses. People talk across the court out of window, and\nbare-headed scouts come hurrying in from Chancery Lane to know what's\nthe matter. The general feeling seems to be that it's a blessing Mr.\nKrook warn't made away with first, mingled with a little natural\ndisappointment that he was not. In the midst of this sensation, the\nbeadle arrives.\n\nThe beadle, though generally understood in the neighbourhood to be a\nridiculous institution, is not without a certain popularity for the\nmoment, if it were only as a man who is going to see the body. The\npoliceman considers him an imbecile civilian, a remnant of the\nbarbarous watchmen times, but gives him admission as something that\nmust be borne with until government shall abolish him. The sensation\nis heightened as the tidings spread from mouth to mouth that the\nbeadle is on the ground and has gone in.\n\nBy and by the beadle comes out, once more intensifying the sensation,\nwhich has rather languished in the interval. He is understood to be\nin want of witnesses for the inquest to-morrow who can tell the\ncoroner and jury anything whatever respecting the deceased. Is\nimmediately referred to innumerable people who can tell nothing\nwhatever. Is made more imbecile by being constantly informed that\nMrs. Green's son \"was a law-writer his-self and knowed him better\nthan anybody,\" which son of Mrs. Green's appears, on inquiry, to be\nat the present time aboard a vessel bound for China, three months\nout, but considered accessible by telegraph on application to the\nLords of the Admiralty. Beadle goes into various shops and parlours,\nexamining the inhabitants, always shutting the door first, and by\nexclusion, delay, and general idiotcy exasperating the public.\nPoliceman seen to smile to potboy. Public loses interest and\nundergoes reaction. Taunts the beadle in shrill youthful voices with\nhaving boiled a boy, choruses fragments of a popular song to that\neffect and importing that the boy was made into soup for the\nworkhouse. Policeman at last finds it necessary to support the law\nand seize a vocalist, who is released upon the flight of the rest on\ncondition of his getting out of this then, come, and cutting it--a\ncondition he immediately observes. So the sensation dies off for the\ntime; and the unmoved policeman (to whom a little opium, more or\nless, is nothing), with his shining hat, stiff stock, inflexible\ngreat-coat, stout belt and bracelet, and all things fitting, pursues\nhis lounging way with a heavy tread, beating the palms of his white\ngloves one against the other and stopping now and then at a\nstreet-corner to look casually about for anything between a lost\nchild and a murder.\n\nUnder cover of the night, the feeble-minded beadle comes flitting\nabout Chancery Lane with his summonses, in which every juror's name\nis wrongly spelt, and nothing rightly spelt but the beadle's own\nname, which nobody can read or wants to know. The summonses served\nand his witnesses forewarned, the beadle goes to Mr. Krook's to keep\na small appointment he has made with certain paupers, who, presently\narriving, are conducted upstairs, where they leave the great eyes in\nthe shutter something new to stare at, in that last shape which\nearthly lodgings take for No one--and for Every one.\n\nAnd all that night the coffin stands ready by the old portmanteau;\nand the lonely figure on the bed, whose path in life has lain through\nfive and forty years, lies there with no more track behind him that\nany one can trace than a deserted infant.\n\nNext day the court is all alive--is like a fair, as Mrs. Perkins,\nmore than reconciled to Mrs. Piper, says in amicable conversation\nwith that excellent woman. The coroner is to sit in the first-floor\nroom at the Sol's Arms, where the Harmonic Meetings take place twice\na week and where the chair is filled by a gentleman of professional\ncelebrity, faced by Little Swills, the comic vocalist, who hopes\n(according to the bill in the window) that his friends will rally\nround him and support first-rate talent. The Sol's Arms does a brisk\nstroke of business all the morning. Even children so require\nsustaining under the general excitement that a pieman who has\nestablished himself for the occasion at the corner of the court says\nhis brandy-balls go off like smoke. What time the beadle, hovering\nbetween the door of Mr. Krook's establishment and the door of the\nSol's Arms, shows the curiosity in his keeping to a few discreet\nspirits and accepts the compliment of a glass of ale or so in return.\n\nAt the appointed hour arrives the coroner, for whom the jurymen are\nwaiting and who is received with a salute of skittles from the good\ndry skittle-ground attached to the Sol's Arms. The coroner frequents\nmore public-houses than any man alive. The smell of sawdust, beer,\ntobacco-smoke, and spirits is inseparable in his vocation from death\nin its most awful shapes. He is conducted by the beadle and the\nlandlord to the Harmonic Meeting Room, where he puts his hat on the\npiano and takes a Windsor-chair at the head of a long table formed of\nseveral short tables put together and ornamented with glutinous rings\nin endless involutions, made by pots and glasses. As many of the jury\nas can crowd together at the table sit there. The rest get among the\nspittoons and pipes or lean against the piano. Over the coroner's\nhead is a small iron garland, the pendant handle of a bell, which\nrather gives the majesty of the court the appearance of going to be\nhanged presently.\n\nCall over and swear the jury! While the ceremony is in progress,\nsensation is created by the entrance of a chubby little man in a\nlarge shirt-collar, with a moist eye and an inflamed nose, who\nmodestly takes a position near the door as one of the general public,\nbut seems familiar with the room too. A whisper circulates that this\nis Little Swills. It is considered not unlikely that he will get up\nan imitation of the coroner and make it the principal feature of the\nHarmonic Meeting in the evening.\n\n\"Well, gentlemen--\" the coroner begins.\n\n\"Silence there, will you!\" says the beadle. Not to the coroner,\nthough it might appear so.\n\n\"Well, gentlemen,\" resumes the coroner. \"You are impanelled here to\ninquire into the death of a certain man. Evidence will be given\nbefore you as to the circumstances attending that death, and you will\ngive your verdict according to the--skittles; they must be stopped,\nyou know, beadle!--evidence, and not according to anything else. The\nfirst thing to be done is to view the body.\"\n\n\"Make way there!\" cries the beadle.\n\nSo they go out in a loose procession, something after the manner of a\nstraggling funeral, and make their inspection in Mr. Krook's back\nsecond floor, from which a few of the jurymen retire pale and\nprecipitately. The beadle is very careful that two gentlemen not very\nneat about the cuffs and buttons (for whose accommodation he has\nprovided a special little table near the coroner in the Harmonic\nMeeting Room) should see all that is to be seen. For they are the\npublic chroniclers of such inquiries by the line; and he is not\nsuperior to the universal human infirmity, but hopes to read in print\nwhat \"Mooney, the active and intelligent beadle of the district,\"\nsaid and did and even aspires to see the name of Mooney as familiarly\nand patronizingly mentioned as the name of the hangman is, according\nto the latest examples.\n\nLittle Swills is waiting for the coroner and jury on their return.\nMr. Tulkinghorn, also. Mr. Tulkinghorn is received with distinction\nand seated near the coroner between that high judicial officer, a\nbagatelle-board, and the coal-box. The inquiry proceeds. The jury\nlearn how the subject of their inquiry died, and learn no more about\nhim. \"A very eminent solicitor is in attendance, gentlemen,\" says the\ncoroner, \"who, I am informed, was accidentally present when discovery\nof the death was made, but he could only repeat the evidence you have\nalready heard from the surgeon, the landlord, the lodger, and the\nlaw-stationer, and it is not necessary to trouble him. Is anybody in\nattendance who knows anything more?\"\n\nMrs. Piper pushed forward by Mrs. Perkins. Mrs. Piper sworn.\n\nAnastasia Piper, gentlemen. Married woman. Now, Mrs. Piper, what have\nyou got to say about this?\n\nWhy, Mrs. Piper has a good deal to say, chiefly in parentheses and\nwithout punctuation, but not much to tell. Mrs. Piper lives in the\ncourt (which her husband is a cabinet-maker), and it has long been\nwell beknown among the neighbours (counting from the day next but one\nbefore the half-baptizing of Alexander James Piper aged eighteen\nmonths and four days old on accounts of not being expected to live\nsuch was the sufferings gentlemen of that child in his gums) as the\nplaintive--so Mrs. Piper insists on calling the deceased--was\nreported to have sold himself. Thinks it was the plaintive's air in\nwhich that report originatinin. See the plaintive often and\nconsidered as his air was feariocious and not to be allowed to go\nabout some children being timid (and if doubted hoping Mrs. Perkins\nmay be brought forard for she is here and will do credit to her\nhusband and herself and family). Has seen the plaintive wexed and\nworrited by the children (for children they will ever be and you\ncannot expect them specially if of playful dispositions to be\nMethoozellers which you was not yourself). On accounts of this and\nhis dark looks has often dreamed as she see him take a pick-axe from\nhis pocket and split Johnny's head (which the child knows not fear\nand has repeatually called after him close at his eels). Never\nhowever see the plaintive take a pick-axe or any other wepping far\nfrom it. Has seen him hurry away when run and called after as if not\npartial to children and never see him speak to neither child nor\ngrown person at any time (excepting the boy that sweeps the crossing\ndown the lane over the way round the corner which if he was here\nwould tell you that he has been seen a-speaking to him frequent).\n\nSays the coroner, is that boy here? Says the beadle, no, sir, he is\nnot here. Says the coroner, go and fetch him then. In the absence of\nthe active and intelligent, the coroner converses with Mr.\nTulkinghorn.\n\nOh! Here's the boy, gentlemen!\n\nHere he is, very muddy, very hoarse, very ragged. Now, boy! But stop\na minute. Caution. This boy must be put through a few preliminary\npaces.\n\nName, Jo. Nothing else that he knows on. Don't know that everybody\nhas two names. Never heerd of sich a think. Don't know that Jo is\nshort for a longer name. Thinks it long enough for HIM. HE don't find\nno fault with it. Spell it? No. HE can't spell it. No father, no\nmother, no friends. Never been to school. What's home? Knows a\nbroom's a broom, and knows it's wicked to tell a lie. Don't recollect\nwho told him about the broom or about the lie, but knows both. Can't\nexactly say what'll be done to him arter he's dead if he tells a lie\nto the gentlemen here, but believes it'll be something wery bad to\npunish him, and serve him right--and so he'll tell the truth.\n\n\"This won't do, gentlemen!\" says the coroner with a melancholy shake\nof the head.\n\n\"Don't you think you can receive his evidence, sir?\" asks an\nattentive juryman.\n\n\"Out of the question,\" says the coroner. \"You have heard the boy.\n'Can't exactly say' won't do, you know. We can't take THAT in a court\nof justice, gentlemen. It's terrible depravity. Put the boy aside.\"\n\nBoy put aside, to the great edification of the audience, especially\nof Little Swills, the comic vocalist.\n\nNow. Is there any other witness? No other witness.\n\nVery well, gentlemen! Here's a man unknown, proved to have been in\nthe habit of taking opium in large quantities for a year and a half,\nfound dead of too much opium. If you think you have any evidence to\nlead you to the conclusion that he committed suicide, you will come\nto that conclusion. If you think it is a case of accidental death,\nyou will find a verdict accordingly.\n\nVerdict accordingly. Accidental death. No doubt. Gentlemen, you are\ndischarged. Good afternoon.\n\nWhile the coroner buttons his great-coat, Mr. Tulkinghorn and he give\nprivate audience to the rejected witness in a corner.\n\nThat graceless creature only knows that the dead man (whom he\nrecognized just now by his yellow face and black hair) was sometimes\nhooted and pursued about the streets. That one cold winter night when\nhe, the boy, was shivering in a doorway near his crossing, the man\nturned to look at him, and came back, and having questioned him and\nfound that he had not a friend in the world, said, \"Neither have I.\nNot one!\" and gave him the price of a supper and a night's lodging.\nThat the man had often spoken to him since and asked him whether he\nslept sound at night, and how he bore cold and hunger, and whether he\never wished to die, and similar strange questions. That when the man\nhad no money, he would say in passing, \"I am as poor as you to-day,\nJo,\" but that when he had any, he had always (as the boy most\nheartily believes) been glad to give him some.\n\n\"He was wery good to me,\" says the boy, wiping his eyes with his\nwretched sleeve. \"Wen I see him a-layin' so stritched out just now, I\nwished he could have heerd me tell him so. He wos wery good to me, he\nwos!\"\n\nAs he shuffles downstairs, Mr. Snagsby, lying in wait for him, puts a\nhalf-crown in his hand. \"If you ever see me coming past your crossing\nwith my little woman--I mean a lady--\" says Mr. Snagsby with his\nfinger on his nose, \"don't allude to it!\"\n\nFor some little time the jurymen hang about the Sol's Arms\ncolloquially. In the sequel, half-a-dozen are caught up in a cloud of\npipe-smoke that pervades the parlour of the Sol's Arms; two stroll to\nHampstead; and four engage to go half-price to the play at night, and\ntop up with oysters. Little Swills is treated on several hands. Being\nasked what he thinks of the proceedings, characterizes them (his\nstrength lying in a slangular direction) as \"a rummy start.\" The\nlandlord of the Sol's Arms, finding Little Swills so popular,\ncommends him highly to the jurymen and public, observing that for a\nsong in character he don't know his equal and that that man's\ncharacter-wardrobe would fill a cart.\n\nThus, gradually the Sol's Arms melts into the shadowy night and then\nflares out of it strong in gas. The Harmonic Meeting hour arriving,\nthe gentleman of professional celebrity takes the chair, is faced\n(red-faced) by Little Swills; their friends rally round them and\nsupport first-rate talent. In the zenith of the evening, Little\nSwills says, \"Gentlemen, if you'll permit me, I'll attempt a short\ndescription of a scene of real life that came off here to-day.\" Is\nmuch applauded and encouraged; goes out of the room as Swills; comes\nin as the coroner (not the least in the world like him); describes\nthe inquest, with recreative intervals of piano-forte accompaniment,\nto the refrain: With his (the coroner's) tippy tol li doll, tippy tol\nlo doll, tippy tol li doll, Dee!\n\nThe jingling piano at last is silent, and the Harmonic friends rally\nround their pillows. Then there is rest around the lonely figure, now\nlaid in its last earthly habitation; and it is watched by the gaunt\neyes in the shutters through some quiet hours of night. If this\nforlorn man could have been prophetically seen lying here by the\nmother at whose breast he nestled, a little child, with eyes upraised\nto her loving face, and soft hand scarcely knowing how to close upon\nthe neck to which it crept, what an impossibility the vision would\nhave seemed! Oh, if in brighter days the now-extinguished fire within\nhim ever burned for one woman who held him in her heart, where is\nshe, while these ashes are above the ground!\n\nIt is anything but a night of rest at Mr. Snagsby's, in Cook's Court,\nwhere Guster murders sleep by going, as Mr. Snagsby himself\nallows--not to put too fine a point upon it--out of one fit into\ntwenty. The occasion of this seizure is that Guster has a tender\nheart and a susceptible something that possibly might have been\nimagination, but for Tooting and her patron saint. Be it what it may,\nnow, it was so direfully impressed at tea-time by Mr. Snagsby's\naccount of the inquiry at which he had assisted that at supper-time\nshe projected herself into the kitchen, preceded by a flying Dutch\ncheese, and fell into a fit of unusual duration, which she only came\nout of to go into another, and another, and so on through a chain of\nfits, with short intervals between, of which she has pathetically\navailed herself by consuming them in entreaties to Mrs. Snagsby not\nto give her warning \"when she quite comes to,\" and also in appeals to\nthe whole establishment to lay her down on the stones and go to bed.\nHence, Mr. Snagsby, at last hearing the cock at the little dairy in\nCursitor Street go into that disinterested ecstasy of his on the\nsubject of daylight, says, drawing a long breath, though the most\npatient of men, \"I thought you was dead, I am sure!\"\n\nWhat question this enthusiastic fowl supposes he settles when he\nstrains himself to such an extent, or why he should thus crow (so men\ncrow on various triumphant public occasions, however) about what\ncannot be of any moment to him, is his affair. It is enough that\ndaylight comes, morning comes, noon comes.\n\nThen the active and intelligent, who has got into the morning papers\nas such, comes with his pauper company to Mr. Krook's and bears off\nthe body of our dear brother here departed to a hemmed-in churchyard,\npestiferous and obscene, whence malignant diseases are communicated\nto the bodies of our dear brothers and sisters who have not departed,\nwhile our dear brothers and sisters who hang about official\nback-stairs--would to heaven they HAD departed!--are very complacent\nand agreeable. Into a beastly scrap of ground which a Turk would\nreject as a savage abomination and a Caffre would shudder at, they\nbring our dear brother here departed to receive Christian burial.\n\nWith houses looking on, on every side, save where a reeking little\ntunnel of a court gives access to the iron gate--with every villainy\nof life in action close on death, and every poisonous element of\ndeath in action close on life--here they lower our dear brother down\na foot or two, here sow him in corruption, to be raised in\ncorruption: an avenging ghost at many a sick-bedside, a shameful\ntestimony to future ages how civilization and barbarism walked this\nboastful island together.\n\nCome night, come darkness, for you cannot come too soon or stay too\nlong by such a place as this! Come, straggling lights into the\nwindows of the ugly houses; and you who do iniquity therein, do it at\nleast with this dread scene shut out! Come, flame of gas, burning so\nsullenly above the iron gate, on which the poisoned air deposits its\nwitch-ointment slimy to the touch! It is well that you should call to\nevery passerby, \"Look here!\"\n\nWith the night comes a slouching figure through the tunnel-court to\nthe outside of the iron gate. It holds the gate with its hands and\nlooks in between the bars, stands looking in for a little while.\n\nIt then, with an old broom it carries, softly sweeps the step and\nmakes the archway clean. It does so very busily and trimly, looks in\nagain a little while, and so departs.\n\nJo, is it thou? Well, well! Though a rejected witness, who \"can't\nexactly say\" what will be done to him in greater hands than men's,\nthou art not quite in outer darkness. There is something like a\ndistant ray of light in thy muttered reason for this: \"He wos wery\ngood to me, he wos!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII\n\nOn the Watch\n\n\nIt has left off raining down in Lincolnshire at last, and Chesney\nWold has taken heart. Mrs. Rouncewell is full of hospitable cares,\nfor Sir Leicester and my Lady are coming home from Paris. The\nfashionable intelligence has found it out and communicates the glad\ntidings to benighted England. It has also found out that they will\nentertain a brilliant and distinguished circle of the ELITE of the\nBEAU MONDE (the fashionable intelligence is weak in English, but a\ngiant refreshed in French) at the ancient and hospitable family seat\nin Lincolnshire.\n\nFor the greater honour of the brilliant and distinguished circle, and\nof Chesney Wold into the bargain, the broken arch of the bridge in\nthe park is mended; and the water, now retired within its proper\nlimits and again spanned gracefully, makes a figure in the prospect\nfrom the house. The clear, cold sunshine glances into the brittle\nwoods and approvingly beholds the sharp wind scattering the leaves\nand drying the moss. It glides over the park after the moving shadows\nof the clouds, and chases them, and never catches them, all day. It\nlooks in at the windows and touches the ancestral portraits with bars\nand patches of brightness never contemplated by the painters. Athwart\nthe picture of my Lady, over the great chimney-piece, it throws a\nbroad bend-sinister of light that strikes down crookedly into the\nhearth and seems to rend it.\n\nThrough the same cold sunshine and the same sharp wind, my Lady and\nSir Leicester, in their travelling chariot (my Lady's woman and Sir\nLeicester's man affectionate in the rumble), start for home. With a\nconsiderable amount of jingling and whip-cracking, and many plunging\ndemonstrations on the part of two bare-backed horses and two centaurs\nwith glazed hats, jack-boots, and flowing manes and tails, they\nrattle out of the yard of the Hotel Bristol in the Place Vendome and\ncanter between the sun-and-shadow-chequered colonnade of the Rue de\nRivoli and the garden of the ill-fated palace of a headless king and\nqueen, off by the Place of Concord, and the Elysian Fields, and the\nGate of the Star, out of Paris.\n\nSooth to say, they cannot go away too fast, for even here my Lady\nDedlock has been bored to death. Concert, assembly, opera, theatre,\ndrive, nothing is new to my Lady under the worn-out heavens. Only\nlast Sunday, when poor wretches were gay--within the walls playing\nwith children among the clipped trees and the statues in the Palace\nGarden; walking, a score abreast, in the Elysian Fields, made more\nElysian by performing dogs and wooden horses; between whiles\nfiltering (a few) through the gloomy Cathedral of Our Lady to say a\nword or two at the base of a pillar within flare of a rusty little\ngridiron-full of gusty little tapers; without the walls encompassing\nParis with dancing, love-making, wine-drinking, tobacco-smoking,\ntomb-visiting, billiard card and domino playing, quack-doctoring, and\nmuch murderous refuse, animate and inanimate--only last Sunday, my\nLady, in the desolation of Boredom and the clutch of Giant Despair,\nalmost hated her own maid for being in spirits.\n\nShe cannot, therefore, go too fast from Paris. Weariness of soul lies\nbefore her, as it lies behind--her Ariel has put a girdle of it round\nthe whole earth, and it cannot be unclasped--but the imperfect remedy\nis always to fly from the last place where it has been experienced.\nFling Paris back into the distance, then, exchanging it for endless\navenues and cross-avenues of wintry trees! And, when next beheld, let\nit be some leagues away, with the Gate of the Star a white speck\nglittering in the sun, and the city a mere mound in a plain--two dark\nsquare towers rising out of it, and light and shadow descending on it\naslant, like the angels in Jacob's dream!\n\nSir Leicester is generally in a complacent state, and rarely bored.\nWhen he has nothing else to do, he can always contemplate his own\ngreatness. It is a considerable advantage to a man to have so\ninexhaustible a subject. After reading his letters, he leans back in\nhis corner of the carriage and generally reviews his importance to\nsociety.\n\n\"You have an unusual amount of correspondence this morning?\" says my\nLady after a long time. She is fatigued with reading. Has almost read\na page in twenty miles.\n\n\"Nothing in it, though. Nothing whatever.\"\n\n\"I saw one of Mr. Tulkinghorn's long effusions, I think?\"\n\n\"You see everything,\" says Sir Leicester with admiration.\n\n\"Ha!\" sighs my Lady. \"He is the most tiresome of men!\"\n\n\"He sends--I really beg your pardon--he sends,\" says Sir Leicester,\nselecting the letter and unfolding it, \"a message to you. Our\nstopping to change horses as I came to his postscript drove it out of\nmy memory. I beg you'll excuse me. He says--\" Sir Leicester is so\nlong in taking out his eye-glass and adjusting it that my Lady looks\na little irritated. \"He says 'In the matter of the right of way--' I\nbeg your pardon, that's not the place. He says--yes! Here I have it!\nHe says, 'I beg my respectful compliments to my Lady, who, I hope,\nhas benefited by the change. Will you do me the favour to mention (as\nit may interest her) that I have something to tell her on her return\nin reference to the person who copied the affidavit in the Chancery\nsuit, which so powerfully stimulated her curiosity. I have seen\nhim.'\"\n\nMy Lady, leaning forward, looks out of her window.\n\n\"That's the message,\" observes Sir Leicester.\n\n\"I should like to walk a little,\" says my Lady, still looking out of\nher window.\n\n\"Walk?\" repeats Sir Leicester in a tone of surprise.\n\n\"I should like to walk a little,\" says my Lady with unmistakable\ndistinctness. \"Please to stop the carriage.\"\n\nThe carriage is stopped, the affectionate man alights from the\nrumble, opens the door, and lets down the steps, obedient to an\nimpatient motion of my Lady's hand. My Lady alights so quickly and\nwalks away so quickly that Sir Leicester, for all his scrupulous\npoliteness, is unable to assist her, and is left behind. A space of a\nminute or two has elapsed before he comes up with her. She smiles,\nlooks very handsome, takes his arm, lounges with him for a quarter of\na mile, is very much bored, and resumes her seat in the carriage.\n\nThe rattle and clatter continue through the greater part of three\ndays, with more or less of bell-jingling and whip-cracking, and more\nor less plunging of centaurs and bare-backed horses. Their courtly\npoliteness to each other at the hotels where they tarry is the theme\nof general admiration. Though my Lord IS a little aged for my Lady,\nsays Madame, the hostess of the Golden Ape, and though he might be\nher amiable father, one can see at a glance that they love each\nother. One observes my Lord with his white hair, standing, hat in\nhand, to help my Lady to and from the carriage. One observes my Lady,\nhow recognisant of my Lord's politeness, with an inclination of her\ngracious head and the concession of her so-genteel fingers! It is\nravishing!\n\nThe sea has no appreciation of great men, but knocks them about like\nthe small fry. It is habitually hard upon Sir Leicester, whose\ncountenance it greenly mottles in the manner of sage-cheese and in\nwhose aristocratic system it effects a dismal revolution. It is the\nRadical of Nature to him. Nevertheless, his dignity gets over it\nafter stopping to refit, and he goes on with my Lady for Chesney\nWold, lying only one night in London on the way to Lincolnshire.\n\nThrough the same cold sunlight, colder as the day declines, and\nthrough the same sharp wind, sharper as the separate shadows of bare\ntrees gloom together in the woods, and as the Ghost's Walk, touched\nat the western corner by a pile of fire in the sky, resigns itself to\ncoming night, they drive into the park. The rooks, swinging in their\nlofty houses in the elm-tree avenue, seem to discuss the question of\nthe occupancy of the carriage as it passes underneath, some agreeing\nthat Sir Leicester and my Lady are come down, some arguing with\nmalcontents who won't admit it, now all consenting to consider the\nquestion disposed of, now all breaking out again in violent debate,\nincited by one obstinate and drowsy bird who will persist in putting\nin a last contradictory croak. Leaving them to swing and caw, the\ntravelling chariot rolls on to the house, where fires gleam warmly\nthrough some of the windows, though not through so many as to give an\ninhabited expression to the darkening mass of front. But the\nbrilliant and distinguished circle will soon do that.\n\nMrs. Rouncewell is in attendance and receives Sir Leicester's\ncustomary shake of the hand with a profound curtsy.\n\n\"How do you do, Mrs. Rouncewell? I am glad to see you.\"\n\n\"I hope I have the honour of welcoming you in good health, Sir\nLeicester?\"\n\n\"In excellent health, Mrs. Rouncewell.\"\n\n\"My Lady is looking charmingly well,\" says Mrs. Rouncewell with\nanother curtsy.\n\nMy Lady signifies, without profuse expenditure of words, that she is\nas wearily well as she can hope to be.\n\nBut Rosa is in the distance, behind the housekeeper; and my Lady, who\nhas not subdued the quickness of her observation, whatever else she\nmay have conquered, asks, \"Who is that girl?\"\n\n\"A young scholar of mine, my Lady. Rosa.\"\n\n\"Come here, Rosa!\" Lady Dedlock beckons her, with even an appearance\nof interest. \"Why, do you know how pretty you are, child?\" she says,\ntouching her shoulder with her two forefingers.\n\nRosa, very much abashed, says, \"No, if you please, my Lady!\" and\nglances up, and glances down, and don't know where to look, but looks\nall the prettier.\n\n\"How old are you?\"\n\n\"Nineteen, my Lady.\"\n\n\"Nineteen,\" repeats my Lady thoughtfully. \"Take care they don't spoil\nyou by flattery.\"\n\n\"Yes, my Lady.\"\n\nMy Lady taps her dimpled cheek with the same delicate gloved fingers\nand goes on to the foot of the oak staircase, where Sir Leicester\npauses for her as her knightly escort. A staring old Dedlock in a\npanel, as large as life and as dull, looks as if he didn't know what\nto make of it, which was probably his general state of mind in the\ndays of Queen Elizabeth.\n\nThat evening, in the housekeeper's room, Rosa can do nothing but\nmurmur Lady Dedlock's praises. She is so affable, so graceful, so\nbeautiful, so elegant; has such a sweet voice and such a thrilling\ntouch that Rosa can feel it yet! Mrs. Rouncewell confirms all this,\nnot without personal pride, reserving only the one point of\naffability. Mrs. Rouncewell is not quite sure as to that. Heaven\nforbid that she should say a syllable in dispraise of any member of\nthat excellent family, above all, of my Lady, whom the whole world\nadmires; but if my Lady would only be \"a little more free,\" not quite\nso cold and distant, Mrs. Rouncewell thinks she would be more\naffable.\n\n\"'Tis almost a pity,\" Mrs. Rouncewell adds--only \"almost\" because it\nborders on impiety to suppose that anything could be better than it\nis, in such an express dispensation as the Dedlock affairs--\"that my\nLady has no family. If she had had a daughter now, a grown young\nlady, to interest her, I think she would have had the only kind of\nexcellence she wants.\"\n\n\"Might not that have made her still more proud, grandmother?\" says\nWatt, who has been home and come back again, he is such a good\ngrandson.\n\n\"More and most, my dear,\" returns the housekeeper with dignity, \"are\nwords it's not my place to use--nor so much as to hear--applied to\nany drawback on my Lady.\"\n\n\"I beg your pardon, grandmother. But she is proud, is she not?\"\n\n\"If she is, she has reason to be. The Dedlock family have always\nreason to be.\"\n\n\"Well,\" says Watt, \"it's to be hoped they line out of their\nprayer-books a certain passage for the common people about pride and\nvainglory. Forgive me, grandmother! Only a joke!\"\n\n\"Sir Leicester and Lady Dedlock, my dear, are not fit subjects for\njoking.\"\n\n\"Sir Leicester is no joke by any means,\" says Watt, \"and I humbly ask\nhis pardon. I suppose, grandmother, that even with the family and\ntheir guests down here, there is no objection to my prolonging my\nstay at the Dedlock Arms for a day or two, as any other traveller\nmight?\"\n\n\"Surely, none in the world, child.\"\n\n\"I am glad of that,\" says Watt, \"because I have an inexpressible\ndesire to extend my knowledge of this beautiful neighbourhood.\"\n\nHe happens to glance at Rosa, who looks down and is very shy indeed.\nBut according to the old superstition, it should be Rosa's ears that\nburn, and not her fresh bright cheeks, for my Lady's maid is holding\nforth about her at this moment with surpassing energy.\n\nMy Lady's maid is a Frenchwoman of two and thirty, from somewhere in\nthe southern country about Avignon and Marseilles, a large-eyed brown\nwoman with black hair who would be handsome but for a certain feline\nmouth and general uncomfortable tightness of face, rendering the jaws\ntoo eager and the skull too prominent. There is something indefinably\nkeen and wan about her anatomy, and she has a watchful way of looking\nout of the corners of her eyes without turning her head which could\nbe pleasantly dispensed with, especially when she is in an ill humour\nand near knives. Through all the good taste of her dress and little\nadornments, these objections so express themselves that she seems to\ngo about like a very neat she-wolf imperfectly tamed. Besides being\naccomplished in all the knowledge appertaining to her post, she is\nalmost an Englishwoman in her acquaintance with the language;\nconsequently, she is in no want of words to shower upon Rosa for\nhaving attracted my Lady's attention, and she pours them out with\nsuch grim ridicule as she sits at dinner that her companion, the\naffectionate man, is rather relieved when she arrives at the spoon\nstage of that performance.\n\nHa, ha, ha! She, Hortense, been in my Lady's service since five years\nand always kept at the distance, and this doll, this puppet,\ncaressed--absolutely caressed--by my Lady on the moment of her\narriving at the house! Ha, ha, ha! \"And do you know how pretty you\nare, child?\" \"No, my Lady.\" You are right there! \"And how old are\nyou, child! And take care they do not spoil you by flattery, child!\"\nOh, how droll! It is the BEST thing altogether.\n\nIn short, it is such an admirable thing that Mademoiselle Hortense\ncan't forget it; but at meals for days afterwards, even among her\ncountrywomen and others attached in like capacity to the troop of\nvisitors, relapses into silent enjoyment of the joke--an enjoyment\nexpressed, in her own convivial manner, by an additional tightness of\nface, thin elongation of compressed lips, and sidewise look, which\nintense appreciation of humour is frequently reflected in my Lady's\nmirrors when my Lady is not among them.\n\nAll the mirrors in the house are brought into action now, many of\nthem after a long blank. They reflect handsome faces, simpering\nfaces, youthful faces, faces of threescore and ten that will not\nsubmit to be old; the entire collection of faces that have come to\npass a January week or two at Chesney Wold, and which the fashionable\nintelligence, a mighty hunter before the Lord, hunts with a keen\nscent, from their breaking cover at the Court of St. James's to their\nbeing run down to death. The place in Lincolnshire is all alive. By\nday guns and voices are heard ringing in the woods, horsemen and\ncarriages enliven the park roads, servants and hangers-on pervade the\nvillage and the Dedlock Arms. Seen by night from distant openings in\nthe trees, the row of windows in the long drawing-room, where my\nLady's picture hangs over the great chimney-piece, is like a row of\njewels set in a black frame. On Sunday the chill little church is\nalmost warmed by so much gallant company, and the general flavour of\nthe Dedlock dust is quenched in delicate perfumes.\n\nThe brilliant and distinguished circle comprehends within it no\ncontracted amount of education, sense, courage, honour, beauty, and\nvirtue. Yet there is something a little wrong about it in despite of\nits immense advantages. What can it be?\n\nDandyism? There is no King George the Fourth now (more the pity) to\nset the dandy fashion; there are no clear-starched jack-towel\nneckcloths, no short-waisted coats, no false calves, no stays. There\nare no caricatures, now, of effeminate exquisites so arrayed,\nswooning in opera boxes with excess of delight and being revived by\nother dainty creatures poking long-necked scent-bottles at their\nnoses. There is no beau whom it takes four men at once to shake into\nhis buckskins, or who goes to see all the executions, or who is\ntroubled with the self-reproach of having once consumed a pea. But is\nthere dandyism in the brilliant and distinguished circle\nnotwithstanding, dandyism of a more mischievous sort, that has got\nbelow the surface and is doing less harmless things than\njack-towelling itself and stopping its own digestion, to which no\nrational person need particularly object?\n\nWhy, yes. It cannot be disguised. There ARE at Chesney Wold this\nJanuary week some ladies and gentlemen of the newest fashion, who\nhave set up a dandyism--in religion, for instance. Who in mere\nlackadaisical want of an emotion have agreed upon a little dandy talk\nabout the vulgar wanting faith in things in general, meaning in the\nthings that have been tried and found wanting, as though a low fellow\nshould unaccountably lose faith in a bad shilling after finding it\nout! Who would make the vulgar very picturesque and faithful by\nputting back the hands upon the clock of time and cancelling a few\nhundred years of history.\n\nThere are also ladies and gentlemen of another fashion, not so new,\nbut very elegant, who have agreed to put a smooth glaze on the world\nand to keep down all its realities. For whom everything must be\nlanguid and pretty. Who have found out the perpetual stoppage. Who\nare to rejoice at nothing and be sorry for nothing. Who are not to be\ndisturbed by ideas. On whom even the fine arts, attending in powder\nand walking backward like the Lord Chamberlain, must array themselves\nin the milliners' and tailors' patterns of past generations and be\nparticularly careful not to be in earnest or to receive any impress\nfrom the moving age.\n\nThen there is my Lord Boodle, of considerable reputation with his\nparty, who has known what office is and who tells Sir Leicester\nDedlock with much gravity, after dinner, that he really does not see\nto what the present age is tending. A debate is not what a debate\nused to be; the House is not what the House used to be; even a\nCabinet is not what it formerly was. He perceives with astonishment\nthat supposing the present government to be overthrown, the limited\nchoice of the Crown, in the formation of a new ministry, would lie\nbetween Lord Coodle and Sir Thomas Doodle--supposing it to be\nimpossible for the Duke of Foodle to act with Goodle, which may be\nassumed to be the case in consequence of the breach arising out of\nthat affair with Hoodle. Then, giving the Home Department and the\nleadership of the House of Commons to Joodle, the Exchequer to\nKoodle, the Colonies to Loodle, and the Foreign Office to Moodle,\nwhat are you to do with Noodle? You can't offer him the Presidency of\nthe Council; that is reserved for Poodle. You can't put him in the\nWoods and Forests; that is hardly good enough for Quoodle. What\nfollows? That the country is shipwrecked, lost, and gone to pieces\n(as is made manifest to the patriotism of Sir Leicester Dedlock)\nbecause you can't provide for Noodle!\n\nOn the other hand, the Right Honourable William Buffy, M.P., contends\nacross the table with some one else that the shipwreck of the\ncountry--about which there is no doubt; it is only the manner of it\nthat is in question--is attributable to Cuffy. If you had done with\nCuffy what you ought to have done when he first came into Parliament,\nand had prevented him from going over to Duffy, you would have got\nhim into alliance with Fuffy, you would have had with you the weight\nattaching as a smart debater to Guffy, you would have brought to bear\nupon the elections the wealth of Huffy, you would have got in for\nthree counties Juffy, Kuffy, and Luffy, and you would have\nstrengthened your administration by the official knowledge and the\nbusiness habits of Muffy. All this, instead of being as you now are,\ndependent on the mere caprice of Puffy!\n\nAs to this point, and as to some minor topics, there are differences\nof opinion; but it is perfectly clear to the brilliant and\ndistinguished circle, all round, that nobody is in question but\nBoodle and his retinue, and Buffy and HIS retinue. These are the\ngreat actors for whom the stage is reserved. A People there are, no\ndoubt--a certain large number of supernumeraries, who are to be\noccasionally addressed, and relied upon for shouts and choruses, as\non the theatrical stage; but Boodle and Buffy, their followers and\nfamilies, their heirs, executors, administrators, and assigns, are\nthe born first-actors, managers, and leaders, and no others can\nappear upon the scene for ever and ever.\n\nIn this, too, there is perhaps more dandyism at Chesney Wold than the\nbrilliant and distinguished circle will find good for itself in the\nlong run. For it is, even with the stillest and politest circles, as\nwith the circle the necromancer draws around him--very strange\nappearances may be seen in active motion outside. With this\ndifference, that being realities and not phantoms, there is the\ngreater danger of their breaking in.\n\nChesney Wold is quite full anyhow, so full that a burning sense of\ninjury arises in the breasts of ill-lodged ladies'-maids, and is not\nto be extinguished. Only one room is empty. It is a turret chamber of\nthe third order of merit, plainly but comfortably furnished and\nhaving an old-fashioned business air. It is Mr. Tulkinghorn's room,\nand is never bestowed on anybody else, for he may come at any time.\nHe is not come yet. It is his quiet habit to walk across the park\nfrom the village in fine weather, to drop into this room as if he had\nnever been out of it since he was last seen there, to request a\nservant to inform Sir Leicester that he is arrived in case he should\nbe wanted, and to appear ten minutes before dinner in the shadow of\nthe library-door. He sleeps in his turret with a complaining\nflag-staff over his head, and has some leads outside on which, any\nfine morning when he is down here, his black figure may be seen\nwalking before breakfast like a larger species of rook.\n\nEvery day before dinner, my Lady looks for him in the dusk of the\nlibrary, but he is not there. Every day at dinner, my Lady glances\ndown the table for the vacant place that would be waiting to receive\nhim if he had just arrived, but there is no vacant place. Every night\nmy Lady casually asks her maid, \"Is Mr. Tulkinghorn come?\"\n\nEvery night the answer is, \"No, my Lady, not yet.\"\n\nOne night, while having her hair undressed, my Lady loses herself in\ndeep thought after this reply until she sees her own brooding face in\nthe opposite glass, and a pair of black eyes curiously observing her.\n\n\"Be so good as to attend,\" says my Lady then, addressing the\nreflection of Hortense, \"to your business. You can contemplate your\nbeauty at another time.\"\n\n\"Pardon! It was your Ladyship's beauty.\"\n\n\"That,\" says my Lady, \"you needn't contemplate at all.\"\n\nAt length, one afternoon a little before sunset, when the bright\ngroups of figures which have for the last hour or two enlivened the\nGhost's Walk are all dispersed and only Sir Leicester and my Lady\nremain upon the terrace, Mr. Tulkinghorn appears. He comes towards\nthem at his usual methodical pace, which is never quickened, never\nslackened. He wears his usual expressionless mask--if it be a\nmask--and carries family secrets in every limb of his body and every\ncrease of his dress. Whether his whole soul is devoted to the great\nor whether he yields them nothing beyond the services he sells is his\npersonal secret. He keeps it, as he keeps the secrets of his clients;\nhe is his own client in that matter, and will never betray himself.\n\n\"How do you do, Mr. Tulkinghorn?\" says Sir Leicester, giving him his\nhand.\n\nMr. Tulkinghorn is quite well. Sir Leicester is quite well. My Lady\nis quite well. All highly satisfactory. The lawyer, with his hands\nbehind him, walks at Sir Leicester's side along the terrace. My Lady\nwalks upon the other side.\n\n\"We expected you before,\" says Sir Leicester. A gracious observation.\nAs much as to say, \"Mr. Tulkinghorn, we remember your existence when\nyou are not here to remind us of it by your presence. We bestow a\nfragment of our minds upon you, sir, you see!\"\n\nMr. Tulkinghorn, comprehending it, inclines his head and says he is\nmuch obliged.\n\n\"I should have come down sooner,\" he explains, \"but that I have been\nmuch engaged with those matters in the several suits between yourself\nand Boythorn.\"\n\n\"A man of a very ill-regulated mind,\" observes Sir Leicester with\nseverity. \"An extremely dangerous person in any community. A man of a\nvery low character of mind.\"\n\n\"He is obstinate,\" says Mr. Tulkinghorn.\n\n\"It is natural to such a man to be so,\" says Sir Leicester, looking\nmost profoundly obstinate himself. \"I am not at all surprised to hear\nit.\"\n\n\"The only question is,\" pursues the lawyer, \"whether you will give up\nanything.\"\n\n\"No, sir,\" replies Sir Leicester. \"Nothing. I give up?\"\n\n\"I don't mean anything of importance. That, of course, I know you\nwould not abandon. I mean any minor point.\"\n\n\"Mr. Tulkinghorn,\" returns Sir Leicester, \"there can be no minor\npoint between myself and Mr. Boythorn. If I go farther, and observe\nthat I cannot readily conceive how ANY right of mine can be a minor\npoint, I speak not so much in reference to myself as an individual as\nin reference to the family position I have it in charge to maintain.\"\n\nMr. Tulkinghorn inclines his head again. \"I have now my\ninstructions,\" he says. \"Mr. Boythorn will give us a good deal of\ntrouble--\"\n\n\"It is the character of such a mind, Mr. Tulkinghorn,\" Sir Leicester\ninterrupts him, \"TO give trouble. An exceedingly ill-conditioned,\nlevelling person. A person who, fifty years ago, would probably have\nbeen tried at the Old Bailey for some demagogue proceeding, and\nseverely punished--if not,\" adds Sir Leicester after a moment's\npause, \"if not hanged, drawn, and quartered.\"\n\nSir Leicester appears to discharge his stately breast of a burden in\npassing this capital sentence, as if it were the next satisfactory\nthing to having the sentence executed.\n\n\"But night is coming on,\" says he, \"and my Lady will take cold. My\ndear, let us go in.\"\n\nAs they turn towards the hall-door, Lady Dedlock addresses Mr.\nTulkinghorn for the first time.\n\n\"You sent me a message respecting the person whose writing I happened\nto inquire about. It was like you to remember the circumstance; I had\nquite forgotten it. Your message reminded me of it again. I can't\nimagine what association I had with a hand like that, but I surely\nhad some.\"\n\n\"You had some?\" Mr. Tulkinghorn repeats.\n\n\"Oh, yes!\" returns my Lady carelessly. \"I think I must have had some.\nAnd did you really take the trouble to find out the writer of that\nactual thing--what is it!--affidavit?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"How very odd!\"\n\nThey pass into a sombre breakfast-room on the ground floor, lighted\nin the day by two deep windows. It is now twilight. The fire glows\nbrightly on the panelled wall and palely on the window-glass, where,\nthrough the cold reflection of the blaze, the colder landscape\nshudders in the wind and a grey mist creeps along, the only traveller\nbesides the waste of clouds.\n\nMy Lady lounges in a great chair in the chimney-corner, and Sir\nLeicester takes another great chair opposite. The lawyer stands\nbefore the fire with his hand out at arm's length, shading his face.\nHe looks across his arm at my Lady.\n\n\"Yes,\" he says, \"I inquired about the man, and found him. And, what\nis very strange, I found him--\"\n\n\"Not to be any out-of-the-way person, I am afraid!\" Lady Dedlock\nlanguidly anticipates.\n\n\"I found him dead.\"\n\n\"Oh, dear me!\" remonstrated Sir Leicester. Not so much shocked by the\nfact as by the fact of the fact being mentioned.\n\n\"I was directed to his lodging--a miserable, poverty-stricken\nplace--and I found him dead.\"\n\n\"You will excuse me, Mr. Tulkinghorn,\" observes Sir Leicester. \"I\nthink the less said--\"\n\n\"Pray, Sir Leicester, let me hear the story out\" (it is my Lady\nspeaking). \"It is quite a story for twilight. How very shocking!\nDead?\"\n\nMr. Tulkinghorn re-asserts it by another inclination of his head.\n\"Whether by his own hand--\"\n\n\"Upon my honour!\" cries Sir Leicester. \"Really!\"\n\n\"Do let me hear the story!\" says my Lady.\n\n\"Whatever you desire, my dear. But, I must say--\"\n\n\"No, you mustn't say! Go on, Mr. Tulkinghorn.\"\n\nSir Leicester's gallantry concedes the point, though he still feels\nthat to bring this sort of squalor among the upper classes is\nreally--really--\n\n\"I was about to say,\" resumes the lawyer with undisturbed calmness,\n\"that whether he had died by his own hand or not, it was beyond my\npower to tell you. I should amend that phrase, however, by saying\nthat he had unquestionably died of his own act, though whether by his\nown deliberate intention or by mischance can never certainly be\nknown. The coroner's jury found that he took the poison\naccidentally.\"\n\n\"And what kind of man,\" my Lady asks, \"was this deplorable creature?\"\n\n\"Very difficult to say,\" returns the lawyer, shaking his head. \"He\nhad lived so wretchedly and was so neglected, with his gipsy colour\nand his wild black hair and beard, that I should have considered him\nthe commonest of the common. The surgeon had a notion that he had\nonce been something better, both in appearance and condition.\"\n\n\"What did they call the wretched being?\"\n\n\"They called him what he had called himself, but no one knew his\nname.\"\n\n\"Not even any one who had attended on him?\"\n\n\"No one had attended on him. He was found dead. In fact, I found\nhim.\"\n\n\"Without any clue to anything more?\"\n\n\"Without any; there was,\" says the lawyer meditatively, \"an old\nportmanteau, but--No, there were no papers.\"\n\nDuring the utterance of every word of this short dialogue, Lady\nDedlock and Mr. Tulkinghorn, without any other alteration in their\ncustomary deportment, have looked very steadily at one another--as\nwas natural, perhaps, in the discussion of so unusual a subject. Sir\nLeicester has looked at the fire, with the general expression of the\nDedlock on the staircase. The story being told, he renews his stately\nprotest, saying that as it is quite clear that no association in my\nLady's mind can possibly be traceable to this poor wretch (unless he\nwas a begging-letter writer), he trusts to hear no more about a\nsubject so far removed from my Lady's station.\n\n\"Certainly, a collection of horrors,\" says my Lady, gathering up her\nmantles and furs, \"but they interest one for the moment! Have the\nkindness, Mr. Tulkinghorn, to open the door for me.\"\n\nMr. Tulkinghorn does so with deference and holds it open while she\npasses out. She passes close to him, with her usual fatigued manner\nand insolent grace. They meet again at dinner--again, next\nday--again, for many days in succession. Lady Dedlock is always the\nsame exhausted deity, surrounded by worshippers, and terribly liable\nto be bored to death, even while presiding at her own shrine. Mr.\nTulkinghorn is always the same speechless repository of noble\nconfidences, so oddly out of place and yet so perfectly at home. They\nappear to take as little note of one another as any two people\nenclosed within the same walls could. But whether each evermore\nwatches and suspects the other, evermore mistrustful of some great\nreservation; whether each is evermore prepared at all points for the\nother, and never to be taken unawares; what each would give to know\nhow much the other knows--all this is hidden, for the time, in their\nown hearts.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII\n\nEsther's Narrative\n\n\nWe held many consultations about what Richard was to be, first\nwithout Mr. Jarndyce, as he had requested, and afterwards with him,\nbut it was a long time before we seemed to make progress. Richard\nsaid he was ready for anything. When Mr. Jarndyce doubted whether he\nmight not already be too old to enter the Navy, Richard said he had\nthought of that, and perhaps he was. When Mr. Jarndyce asked him what\nhe thought of the Army, Richard said he had thought of that, too, and\nit wasn't a bad idea. When Mr. Jarndyce advised him to try and decide\nwithin himself whether his old preference for the sea was an ordinary\nboyish inclination or a strong impulse, Richard answered, Well he\nreally HAD tried very often, and he couldn't make out.\n\n\"How much of this indecision of character,\" Mr. Jarndyce said to me,\n\"is chargeable on that incomprehensible heap of uncertainty and\nprocrastination on which he has been thrown from his birth, I don't\npretend to say; but that Chancery, among its other sins, is\nresponsible for some of it, I can plainly see. It has engendered or\nconfirmed in him a habit of putting off--and trusting to this, that,\nand the other chance, without knowing what chance--and dismissing\neverything as unsettled, uncertain, and confused. The character of\nmuch older and steadier people may be even changed by the\ncircumstances surrounding them. It would be too much to expect that a\nboy's, in its formation, should be the subject of such influences and\nescape them.\"\n\nI felt this to be true; though if I may venture to mention what I\nthought besides, I thought it much to be regretted that Richard's\neducation had not counteracted those influences or directed his\ncharacter. He had been eight years at a public school and had learnt,\nI understood, to make Latin verses of several sorts in the most\nadmirable manner. But I never heard that it had been anybody's\nbusiness to find out what his natural bent was, or where his failings\nlay, or to adapt any kind of knowledge to HIM. HE had been adapted to\nthe verses and had learnt the art of making them to such perfection\nthat if he had remained at school until he was of age, I suppose he\ncould only have gone on making them over and over again unless he had\nenlarged his education by forgetting how to do it. Still, although I\nhad no doubt that they were very beautiful, and very improving, and\nvery sufficient for a great many purposes of life, and always\nremembered all through life, I did doubt whether Richard would not\nhave profited by some one studying him a little, instead of his\nstudying them quite so much.\n\nTo be sure, I knew nothing of the subject and do not even now know\nwhether the young gentlemen of classic Rome or Greece made verses to\nthe same extent--or whether the young gentlemen of any country ever\ndid.\n\n\"I haven't the least idea,\" said Richard, musing, \"what I had better\nbe. Except that I am quite sure I don't want to go into the Church,\nit's a toss-up.\"\n\n\"You have no inclination in Mr. Kenge's way?\" suggested Mr. Jarndyce.\n\n\"I don't know that, sir!\" replied Richard. \"I am fond of boating.\nArticled clerks go a good deal on the water. It's a capital\nprofession!\"\n\n\"Surgeon--\" suggested Mr. Jarndyce.\n\n\"That's the thing, sir!\" cried Richard.\n\nI doubt if he had ever once thought of it before.\n\n\"That's the thing, sir,\" repeated Richard with the greatest\nenthusiasm. \"We have got it at last. M.R.C.S.!\"\n\nHe was not to be laughed out of it, though he laughed at it heartily.\nHe said he had chosen his profession, and the more he thought of it,\nthe more he felt that his destiny was clear; the art of healing was\nthe art of all others for him. Mistrusting that he only came to this\nconclusion because, having never had much chance of finding out for\nhimself what he was fitted for and having never been guided to the\ndiscovery, he was taken by the newest idea and was glad to get rid of\nthe trouble of consideration, I wondered whether the Latin verses\noften ended in this or whether Richard's was a solitary case.\n\nMr. Jarndyce took great pains to talk with him seriously and to put\nit to his good sense not to deceive himself in so important a matter.\nRichard was a little grave after these interviews, but invariably\ntold Ada and me that it was all right, and then began to talk about\nsomething else.\n\n\"By heaven!\" cried Mr. Boythorn, who interested himself strongly in\nthe subject--though I need not say that, for he could do nothing\nweakly; \"I rejoice to find a young gentleman of spirit and gallantry\ndevoting himself to that noble profession! The more spirit there is\nin it, the better for mankind and the worse for those mercenary\ntask-masters and low tricksters who delight in putting that\nillustrious art at a disadvantage in the world. By all that is base\nand despicable,\" cried Mr. Boythorn, \"the treatment of surgeons\naboard ship is such that I would submit the legs--both legs--of every\nmember of the Admiralty Board to a compound fracture and render it a\ntransportable offence in any qualified practitioner to set them if\nthe system were not wholly changed in eight and forty hours!\"\n\n\"Wouldn't you give them a week?\" asked Mr. Jarndyce.\n\n\"No!\" cried Mr. Boythorn firmly. \"Not on any consideration! Eight and\nforty hours! As to corporations, parishes, vestry-boards, and similar\ngatherings of jolter-headed clods who assemble to exchange such\nspeeches that, by heaven, they ought to be worked in quicksilver\nmines for the short remainder of their miserable existence, if it\nwere only to prevent their detestable English from contaminating a\nlanguage spoken in the presence of the sun--as to those fellows, who\nmeanly take advantage of the ardour of gentlemen in the pursuit of\nknowledge to recompense the inestimable services of the best years of\ntheir lives, their long study, and their expensive education with\npittances too small for the acceptance of clerks, I would have the\nnecks of every one of them wrung and their skulls arranged in\nSurgeons' Hall for the contemplation of the whole profession in order\nthat its younger members might understand from actual measurement, in\nearly life, HOW thick skulls may become!\"\n\nHe wound up this vehement declaration by looking round upon us with a\nmost agreeable smile and suddenly thundering, \"Ha, ha, ha!\" over and\nover again, until anybody else might have been expected to be quite\nsubdued by the exertion.\n\nAs Richard still continued to say that he was fixed in his choice\nafter repeated periods for consideration had been recommended by Mr.\nJarndyce and had expired, and he still continued to assure Ada and me\nin the same final manner that it was \"all right,\" it became advisable\nto take Mr. Kenge into council. Mr. Kenge, therefore, came down to\ndinner one day, and leaned back in his chair, and turned his\neye-glasses over and over, and spoke in a sonorous voice, and did\nexactly what I remembered to have seen him do when I was a little\ngirl.\n\n\"Ah!\" said Mr. Kenge. \"Yes. Well! A very good profession, Mr.\nJarndyce, a very good profession.\"\n\n\"The course of study and preparation requires to be diligently\npursued,\" observed my guardian with a glance at Richard.\n\n\"Oh, no doubt,\" said Mr. Kenge. \"Diligently.\"\n\n\"But that being the case, more or less, with all pursuits that are\nworth much,\" said Mr. Jarndyce, \"it is not a special consideration\nwhich another choice would be likely to escape.\"\n\n\"Truly,\" said Mr. Kenge. \"And Mr. Richard Carstone, who has so\nmeritoriously acquitted himself in the--shall I say the classic\nshades?--in which his youth had been passed, will, no doubt, apply\nthe habits, if not the principles and practice, of versification in\nthat tongue in which a poet was said (unless I mistake) to be born,\nnot made, to the more eminently practical field of action on which he\nenters.\"\n\n\"You may rely upon it,\" said Richard in his off-hand manner, \"that I\nshall go at it and do my best.\"\n\n\"Very well, Mr. Jarndyce!\" said Mr. Kenge, gently nodding his head.\n\"Really, when we are assured by Mr. Richard that he means to go at it\nand to do his best,\" nodding feelingly and smoothly over those\nexpressions, \"I would submit to you that we have only to inquire into\nthe best mode of carrying out the object of his ambition. Now, with\nreference to placing Mr. Richard with some sufficiently eminent\npractitioner. Is there any one in view at present?\"\n\n\"No one, Rick, I think?\" said my guardian.\n\n\"No one, sir,\" said Richard.\n\n\"Quite so!\" observed Mr. Kenge. \"As to situation, now. Is there any\nparticular feeling on that head?\"\n\n\"N--no,\" said Richard.\n\n\"Quite so!\" observed Mr. Kenge again.\n\n\"I should like a little variety,\" said Richard; \"I mean a good range\nof experience.\"\n\n\"Very requisite, no doubt,\" returned Mr. Kenge. \"I think this may be\neasily arranged, Mr. Jarndyce? We have only, in the first place, to\ndiscover a sufficiently eligible practitioner; and as soon as we make\nour want--and shall I add, our ability to pay a premium?--known, our\nonly difficulty will be in the selection of one from a large number.\nWe have only, in the second place, to observe those little\nformalities which are rendered necessary by our time of life and our\nbeing under the guardianship of the court. We shall soon be--shall I\nsay, in Mr. Richard's own light-hearted manner, 'going at it'--to our\nheart's content. It is a coincidence,\" said Mr. Kenge with a tinge of\nmelancholy in his smile, \"one of those coincidences which may or may\nnot require an explanation beyond our present limited faculties, that\nI have a cousin in the medical profession. He might be deemed\neligible by you and might be disposed to respond to this proposal. I\ncan answer for him as little as for you, but he MIGHT!\"\n\nAs this was an opening in the prospect, it was arranged that Mr.\nKenge should see his cousin. And as Mr. Jarndyce had before proposed\nto take us to London for a few weeks, it was settled next day that we\nshould make our visit at once and combine Richard's business with it.\n\nMr. Boythorn leaving us within a week, we took up our abode at a\ncheerful lodging near Oxford Street over an upholsterer's shop.\nLondon was a great wonder to us, and we were out for hours and hours\nat a time, seeing the sights, which appeared to be less capable of\nexhaustion than we were. We made the round of the principal theatres,\ntoo, with great delight, and saw all the plays that were worth\nseeing. I mention this because it was at the theatre that I began to\nbe made uncomfortable again by Mr. Guppy.\n\nI was sitting in front of the box one night with Ada, and Richard was\nin the place he liked best, behind Ada's chair, when, happening to\nlook down into the pit, I saw Mr. Guppy, with his hair flattened down\nupon his head and woe depicted in his face, looking up at me. I felt\nall through the performance that he never looked at the actors but\nconstantly looked at me, and always with a carefully prepared\nexpression of the deepest misery and the profoundest dejection.\n\nIt quite spoiled my pleasure for that night because it was so very\nembarrassing and so very ridiculous. But from that time forth, we\nnever went to the play without my seeing Mr. Guppy in the pit, always\nwith his hair straight and flat, his shirt-collar turned down, and a\ngeneral feebleness about him. If he were not there when we went in,\nand I began to hope he would not come and yielded myself for a little\nwhile to the interest of the scene, I was certain to encounter his\nlanguishing eyes when I least expected it and, from that time, to be\nquite sure that they were fixed upon me all the evening.\n\nI really cannot express how uneasy this made me. If he would only\nhave brushed up his hair or turned up his collar, it would have been\nbad enough; but to know that that absurd figure was always gazing at\nme, and always in that demonstrative state of despondency, put such a\nconstraint upon me that I did not like to laugh at the play, or to\ncry at it, or to move, or to speak. I seemed able to do nothing\nnaturally. As to escaping Mr. Guppy by going to the back of the box,\nI could not bear to do that because I knew Richard and Ada relied on\nhaving me next them and that they could never have talked together so\nhappily if anybody else had been in my place. So there I sat, not\nknowing where to look--for wherever I looked, I knew Mr. Guppy's eyes\nwere following me--and thinking of the dreadful expense to which this\nyoung man was putting himself on my account.\n\nSometimes I thought of telling Mr. Jarndyce. Then I feared that the\nyoung man would lose his situation and that I might ruin him.\nSometimes I thought of confiding in Richard, but was deterred by the\npossibility of his fighting Mr. Guppy and giving him black eyes.\nSometimes I thought, should I frown at him or shake my head. Then I\nfelt I could not do it. Sometimes I considered whether I should write\nto his mother, but that ended in my being convinced that to open a\ncorrespondence would be to make the matter worse. I always came to\nthe conclusion, finally, that I could do nothing. Mr. Guppy's\nperseverance, all this time, not only produced him regularly at any\ntheatre to which we went, but caused him to appear in the crowd as we\nwere coming out, and even to get up behind our fly--where I am sure I\nsaw him, two or three times, struggling among the most dreadful\nspikes. After we got home, he haunted a post opposite our house. The\nupholsterer's where we lodged being at the corner of two streets, and\nmy bedroom window being opposite the post, I was afraid to go near\nthe window when I went upstairs, lest I should see him (as I did one\nmoonlight night) leaning against the post and evidently catching\ncold. If Mr. Guppy had not been, fortunately for me, engaged in the\ndaytime, I really should have had no rest from him.\n\nWhile we were making this round of gaieties, in which Mr. Guppy so\nextraordinarily participated, the business which had helped to bring\nus to town was not neglected. Mr. Kenge's cousin was a Mr. Bayham\nBadger, who had a good practice at Chelsea and attended a large\npublic institution besides. He was quite willing to receive Richard\ninto his house and to superintend his studies, and as it seemed that\nthose could be pursued advantageously under Mr. Badger's roof, and\nMr. Badger liked Richard, and as Richard said he liked Mr. Badger\n\"well enough,\" an agreement was made, the Lord Chancellor's consent\nwas obtained, and it was all settled.\n\nOn the day when matters were concluded between Richard and Mr.\nBadger, we were all under engagement to dine at Mr. Badger's house.\nWe were to be \"merely a family party,\" Mrs. Badger's note said; and\nwe found no lady there but Mrs. Badger herself. She was surrounded in\nthe drawing-room by various objects, indicative of her painting a\nlittle, playing the piano a little, playing the guitar a little,\nplaying the harp a little, singing a little, working a little,\nreading a little, writing poetry a little, and botanizing a little.\nShe was a lady of about fifty, I should think, youthfully dressed,\nand of a very fine complexion. If I add to the little list of her\naccomplishments that she rouged a little, I do not mean that there\nwas any harm in it.\n\nMr. Bayham Badger himself was a pink, fresh-faced, crisp-looking\ngentleman with a weak voice, white teeth, light hair, and surprised\neyes, some years younger, I should say, than Mrs. Bayham Badger. He\nadmired her exceedingly, but principally, and to begin with, on the\ncurious ground (as it seemed to us) of her having had three husbands.\nWe had barely taken our seats when he said to Mr. Jarndyce quite\ntriumphantly, \"You would hardly suppose that I am Mrs. Bayham\nBadger's third!\"\n\n\"Indeed?\" said Mr. Jarndyce.\n\n\"Her third!\" said Mr. Badger. \"Mrs. Bayham Badger has not the\nappearance, Miss Summerson, of a lady who has had two former\nhusbands?\"\n\nI said \"Not at all!\"\n\n\"And most remarkable men!\" said Mr. Badger in a tone of confidence.\n\"Captain Swosser of the Royal Navy, who was Mrs. Badger's first\nhusband, was a very distinguished officer indeed. The name of\nProfessor Dingo, my immediate predecessor, is one of European\nreputation.\"\n\nMrs. Badger overheard him and smiled.\n\n\"Yes, my dear!\" Mr. Badger replied to the smile, \"I was observing to\nMr. Jarndyce and Miss Summerson that you had had two former\nhusbands--both very distinguished men. And they found it, as people\ngenerally do, difficult to believe.\"\n\n\"I was barely twenty,\" said Mrs. Badger, \"when I married Captain\nSwosser of the Royal Navy. I was in the Mediterranean with him; I am\nquite a sailor. On the twelfth anniversary of my wedding-day, I\nbecame the wife of Professor Dingo.\"\n\n\"Of European reputation,\" added Mr. Badger in an undertone.\n\n\"And when Mr. Badger and myself were married,\" pursued Mrs. Badger,\n\"we were married on the same day of the year. I had become attached\nto the day.\"\n\n\"So that Mrs. Badger has been married to three husbands--two of them\nhighly distinguished men,\" said Mr. Badger, summing up the facts,\n\"and each time upon the twenty-first of March at eleven in the\nforenoon!\"\n\nWe all expressed our admiration.\n\n\"But for Mr. Badger's modesty,\" said Mr. Jarndyce, \"I would take\nleave to correct him and say three distinguished men.\"\n\n\"Thank you, Mr. Jarndyce! What I always tell him!\" observed Mrs.\nBadger.\n\n\"And, my dear,\" said Mr. Badger, \"what do I always tell you? That\nwithout any affectation of disparaging such professional distinction\nas I may have attained (which our friend Mr. Carstone will have many\nopportunities of estimating), I am not so weak--no, really,\" said Mr.\nBadger to us generally, \"so unreasonable--as to put my reputation on\nthe same footing with such first-rate men as Captain Swosser and\nProfessor Dingo. Perhaps you may be interested, Mr. Jarndyce,\"\ncontinued Mr. Bayham Badger, leading the way into the next\ndrawing-room, \"in this portrait of Captain Swosser. It was taken on\nhis return home from the African station, where he had suffered from\nthe fever of the country. Mrs. Badger considers it too yellow. But\nit's a very fine head. A very fine head!\"\n\nWe all echoed, \"A very fine head!\"\n\n\"I feel when I look at it,\" said Mr. Badger, \"'That's a man I should\nlike to have seen!' It strikingly bespeaks the first-class man that\nCaptain Swosser pre-eminently was. On the other side, Professor\nDingo. I knew him well--attended him in his last illness--a speaking\nlikeness! Over the piano, Mrs. Bayham Badger when Mrs. Swosser. Over\nthe sofa, Mrs. Bayham Badger when Mrs. Dingo. Of Mrs. Bayham Badger\nIN ESSE, I possess the original and have no copy.\"\n\nDinner was now announced, and we went downstairs. It was a very\ngenteel entertainment, very handsomely served. But the captain and\nthe professor still ran in Mr. Badger's head, and as Ada and I had\nthe honour of being under his particular care, we had the full\nbenefit of them.\n\n\"Water, Miss Summerson? Allow me! Not in that tumbler, pray. Bring me\nthe professor's goblet, James!\"\n\nAda very much admired some artificial flowers under a glass.\n\n\"Astonishing how they keep!\" said Mr. Badger. \"They were presented to\nMrs. Bayham Badger when she was in the Mediterranean.\"\n\nHe invited Mr. Jarndyce to take a glass of claret.\n\n\"Not that claret!\" he said. \"Excuse me! This is an occasion, and ON\nan occasion I produce some very special claret I happen to have.\n(James, Captain Swosser's wine!) Mr. Jarndyce, this is a wine that\nwas imported by the captain, we will not say how many years ago. You\nwill find it very curious. My dear, I shall be happy to take some of\nthis wine with you. (Captain Swosser's claret to your mistress,\nJames!) My love, your health!\"\n\nAfter dinner, when we ladies retired, we took Mrs. Badger's first and\nsecond husband with us. Mrs. Badger gave us in the drawing-room a\nbiographical sketch of the life and services of Captain Swosser\nbefore his marriage and a more minute account of him dating from the\ntime when he fell in love with her at a ball on board the Crippler,\ngiven to the officers of that ship when she lay in Plymouth Harbour.\n\n\"The dear old Crippler!\" said Mrs. Badger, shaking her head. \"She was\na noble vessel. Trim, ship-shape, all a taunto, as Captain Swosser\nused to say. You must excuse me if I occasionally introduce a\nnautical expression; I was quite a sailor once. Captain Swosser loved\nthat craft for my sake. When she was no longer in commission, he\nfrequently said that if he were rich enough to buy her old hulk, he\nwould have an inscription let into the timbers of the quarter-deck\nwhere we stood as partners in the dance to mark the spot where he\nfell--raked fore and aft (Captain Swosser used to say) by the fire\nfrom my tops. It was his naval way of mentioning my eyes.\"\n\nMrs. Badger shook her head, sighed, and looked in the glass.\n\n\"It was a great change from Captain Swosser to Professor Dingo,\" she\nresumed with a plaintive smile. \"I felt it a good deal at first. Such\nan entire revolution in my mode of life! But custom, combined with\nscience--particularly science--inured me to it. Being the professor's\nsole companion in his botanical excursions, I almost forgot that I\nhad ever been afloat, and became quite learned. It is singular that\nthe professor was the antipodes of Captain Swosser and that Mr.\nBadger is not in the least like either!\"\n\nWe then passed into a narrative of the deaths of Captain Swosser and\nProfessor Dingo, both of whom seem to have had very bad complaints.\nIn the course of it, Mrs. Badger signified to us that she had never\nmadly loved but once and that the object of that wild affection,\nnever to be recalled in its fresh enthusiasm, was Captain Swosser.\nThe professor was yet dying by inches in the most dismal manner, and\nMrs. Badger was giving us imitations of his way of saying, with great\ndifficulty, \"Where is Laura? Let Laura give me my toast and water!\"\nwhen the entrance of the gentlemen consigned him to the tomb.\n\nNow, I observed that evening, as I had observed for some days past,\nthat Ada and Richard were more than ever attached to each other's\nsociety, which was but natural, seeing that they were going to be\nseparated so soon. I was therefore not very much surprised when we\ngot home, and Ada and I retired upstairs, to find Ada more silent\nthan usual, though I was not quite prepared for her coming into my\narms and beginning to speak to me, with her face hidden.\n\n\"My darling Esther!\" murmured Ada. \"I have a great secret to tell\nyou!\"\n\nA mighty secret, my pretty one, no doubt!\n\n\"What is it, Ada?\"\n\n\"Oh, Esther, you would never guess!\"\n\n\"Shall I try to guess?\" said I.\n\n\"Oh, no! Don't! Pray don't!\" cried Ada, very much startled by the\nidea of my doing so.\n\n\"Now, I wonder who it can be about?\" said I, pretending to consider.\n\n\"It's about--\" said Ada in a whisper. \"It's about--my cousin\nRichard!\"\n\n\"Well, my own!\" said I, kissing her bright hair, which was all I\ncould see. \"And what about him?\"\n\n\"Oh, Esther, you would never guess!\"\n\nIt was so pretty to have her clinging to me in that way, hiding her\nface, and to know that she was not crying in sorrow but in a little\nglow of joy, and pride, and hope, that I would not help her just yet.\n\n\"He says--I know it's very foolish, we are both so young--but he\nsays,\" with a burst of tears, \"that he loves me dearly, Esther.\"\n\n\"Does he indeed?\" said I. \"I never heard of such a thing! Why, my pet\nof pets, I could have told you that weeks and weeks ago!\"\n\nTo see Ada lift up her flushed face in joyful surprise, and hold me\nround the neck, and laugh, and cry, and blush, was so pleasant!\n\n\"Why, my darling,\" said I, \"what a goose you must take me for! Your\ncousin Richard has been loving you as plainly as he could for I don't\nknow how long!\"\n\n\"And yet you never said a word about it!\" cried Ada, kissing me.\n\n\"No, my love,\" said I. \"I waited to be told.\"\n\n\"But now I have told you, you don't think it wrong of me, do you?\"\nreturned Ada. She might have coaxed me to say no if I had been the\nhardest-hearted duenna in the world. Not being that yet, I said no\nvery freely.\n\n\"And now,\" said I, \"I know the worst of it.\"\n\n\"Oh, that's not quite the worst of it, Esther dear!\" cried Ada,\nholding me tighter and laying down her face again upon my breast.\n\n\"No?\" said I. \"Not even that?\"\n\n\"No, not even that!\" said Ada, shaking her head.\n\n\"Why, you never mean to say--\" I was beginning in joke.\n\nBut Ada, looking up and smiling through her tears, cried, \"Yes, I do!\nYou know, you know I do!\" And then sobbed out, \"With all my heart I\ndo! With all my whole heart, Esther!\"\n\nI told her, laughing, why I had known that, too, just as well as I\nhad known the other! And we sat before the fire, and I had all the\ntalking to myself for a little while (though there was not much of\nit); and Ada was soon quiet and happy.\n\n\"Do you think my cousin John knows, dear Dame Durden?\" she asked.\n\n\"Unless my cousin John is blind, my pet,\" said I, \"I should think my\ncousin John knows pretty well as much as we know.\"\n\n\"We want to speak to him before Richard goes,\" said Ada timidly, \"and\nwe wanted you to advise us, and to tell him so. Perhaps you wouldn't\nmind Richard's coming in, Dame Durden?\"\n\n\"Oh! Richard is outside, is he, my dear?\" said I.\n\n\"I am not quite certain,\" returned Ada with a bashful simplicity that\nwould have won my heart if she had not won it long before, \"but I\nthink he's waiting at the door.\"\n\nThere he was, of course. They brought a chair on either side of me,\nand put me between them, and really seemed to have fallen in love\nwith me instead of one another, they were so confiding, and so\ntrustful, and so fond of me. They went on in their own wild way for a\nlittle while--I never stopped them; I enjoyed it too much myself--and\nthen we gradually fell to considering how young they were, and how\nthere must be a lapse of several years before this early love could\ncome to anything, and how it could come to happiness only if it were\nreal and lasting and inspired them with a steady resolution to do\ntheir duty to each other, with constancy, fortitude, and\nperseverance, each always for the other's sake. Well! Richard said\nthat he would work his fingers to the bone for Ada, and Ada said that\nshe would work her fingers to the bone for Richard, and they called\nme all sorts of endearing and sensible names, and we sat there,\nadvising and talking, half the night. Finally, before we parted, I\ngave them my promise to speak to their cousin John to-morrow.\n\nSo, when to-morrow came, I went to my guardian after breakfast, in\nthe room that was our town-substitute for the growlery, and told him\nthat I had it in trust to tell him something.\n\n\"Well, little woman,\" said he, shutting up his book, \"if you have\naccepted the trust, there can be no harm in it.\"\n\n\"I hope not, guardian,\" said I. \"I can guarantee that there is no\nsecrecy in it. For it only happened yesterday.\"\n\n\"Aye? And what is it, Esther?\"\n\n\"Guardian,\" said I, \"you remember the happy night when first we came\ndown to Bleak House? When Ada was singing in the dark room?\"\n\nI wished to call to his remembrance the look he had given me then.\nUnless I am much mistaken, I saw that I did so.\n\n\"Because--\" said I with a little hesitation.\n\n\"Yes, my dear!\" said he. \"Don't hurry.\"\n\n\"Because,\" said I, \"Ada and Richard have fallen in love. And have\ntold each other so.\"\n\n\"Already!\" cried my guardian, quite astonished.\n\n\"Yes!\" said I. \"And to tell you the truth, guardian, I rather\nexpected it.\"\n\n\"The deuce you did!\" said he.\n\nHe sat considering for a minute or two, with his smile, at once so\nhandsome and so kind, upon his changing face, and then requested me\nto let them know that he wished to see them. When they came, he\nencircled Ada with one arm in his fatherly way and addressed himself\nto Richard with a cheerful gravity.\n\n\"Rick,\" said Mr. Jarndyce, \"I am glad to have won your confidence. I\nhope to preserve it. When I contemplated these relations between us\nfour which have so brightened my life and so invested it with new\ninterests and pleasures, I certainly did contemplate, afar off, the\npossibility of you and your pretty cousin here (don't be shy, Ada,\ndon't be shy, my dear!) being in a mind to go through life together.\nI saw, and do see, many reasons to make it desirable. But that was\nafar off, Rick, afar off!\"\n\n\"We look afar off, sir,\" returned Richard.\n\n\"Well!\" said Mr. Jarndyce. \"That's rational. Now, hear me, my dears!\nI might tell you that you don't know your own minds yet, that a\nthousand things may happen to divert you from one another, that it is\nwell this chain of flowers you have taken up is very easily broken,\nor it might become a chain of lead. But I will not do that. Such\nwisdom will come soon enough, I dare say, if it is to come at all. I\nwill assume that a few years hence you will be in your hearts to one\nanother what you are to-day. All I say before speaking to you\naccording to that assumption is, if you DO change--if you DO come to\nfind that you are more commonplace cousins to each other as man and\nwoman than you were as boy and girl (your manhood will excuse me,\nRick!)--don't be ashamed still to confide in me, for there will be\nnothing monstrous or uncommon in it. I am only your friend and\ndistant kinsman. I have no power over you whatever. But I wish and\nhope to retain your confidence if I do nothing to forfeit it.\"\n\n\"I am very sure, sir,\" returned Richard, \"that I speak for Ada too\nwhen I say that you have the strongest power over us both--rooted in\nrespect, gratitude, and affection--strengthening every day.\"\n\n\"Dear cousin John,\" said Ada, on his shoulder, \"my father's place can\nnever be empty again. All the love and duty I could ever have\nrendered to him is transferred to you.\"\n\n\"Come!\" said Mr. Jarndyce. \"Now for our assumption. Now we lift our\neyes up and look hopefully at the distance! Rick, the world is before\nyou; and it is most probable that as you enter it, so it will receive\nyou. Trust in nothing but in Providence and your own efforts. Never\nseparate the two, like the heathen waggoner. Constancy in love is a\ngood thing, but it means nothing, and is nothing, without constancy\nin every kind of effort. If you had the abilities of all the great\nmen, past and present, you could do nothing well without sincerely\nmeaning it and setting about it. If you entertain the supposition\nthat any real success, in great things or in small, ever was or could\nbe, ever will or can be, wrested from Fortune by fits and starts,\nleave that wrong idea here or leave your cousin Ada here.\"\n\n\"I will leave IT here, sir,\" replied Richard smiling, \"if I brought\nit here just now (but I hope I did not), and will work my way on to\nmy cousin Ada in the hopeful distance.\"\n\n\"Right!\" said Mr. Jarndyce. \"If you are not to make her happy, why\nshould you pursue her?\"\n\n\"I wouldn't make her unhappy--no, not even for her love,\" retorted\nRichard proudly.\n\n\"Well said!\" cried Mr. Jarndyce. \"That's well said! She remains here,\nin her home with me. Love her, Rick, in your active life, no less\nthan in her home when you revisit it, and all will go well.\nOtherwise, all will go ill. That's the end of my preaching. I think\nyou and Ada had better take a walk.\"\n\nAda tenderly embraced him, and Richard heartily shook hands with him,\nand then the cousins went out of the room, looking back again\ndirectly, though, to say that they would wait for me.\n\nThe door stood open, and we both followed them with our eyes as they\npassed down the adjoining room, on which the sun was shining, and out\nat its farther end. Richard with his head bent, and her hand drawn\nthrough his arm, was talking to her very earnestly; and she looked up\nin his face, listening, and seemed to see nothing else. So young, so\nbeautiful, so full of hope and promise, they went on lightly through\nthe sunlight as their own happy thoughts might then be traversing the\nyears to come and making them all years of brightness. So they passed\naway into the shadow and were gone. It was only a burst of light that\nhad been so radiant. The room darkened as they went out, and the sun\nwas clouded over.\n\n\"Am I right, Esther?\" said my guardian when they were gone.\n\nHe was so good and wise to ask ME whether he was right!\n\n\"Rick may gain, out of this, the quality he wants. Wants, at the core\nof so much that is good!\" said Mr. Jarndyce, shaking his head. \"I\nhave said nothing to Ada, Esther. She has her friend and counsellor\nalways near.\" And he laid his hand lovingly upon my head.\n\nI could not help showing that I was a little moved, though I did all\nI could to conceal it.\n\n\"Tut tut!\" said he. \"But we must take care, too, that our little\nwoman's life is not all consumed in care for others.\"\n\n\"Care? My dear guardian, I believe I am the happiest creature in the\nworld!\"\n\n\"I believe so, too,\" said he. \"But some one may find out what Esther\nnever will--that the little woman is to be held in remembrance above\nall other people!\"\n\nI have omitted to mention in its place that there was some one else\nat the family dinner party. It was not a lady. It was a gentleman. It\nwas a gentleman of a dark complexion--a young surgeon. He was rather\nreserved, but I thought him very sensible and agreeable. At least,\nAda asked me if I did not, and I said yes.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV\n\nDeportment\n\n\nRichard left us on the very next evening to begin his new career, and\ncommitted Ada to my charge with great love for her and great trust in\nme. It touched me then to reflect, and it touches me now, more\nnearly, to remember (having what I have to tell) how they both\nthought of me, even at that engrossing time. I was a part of all\ntheir plans, for the present and the future. I was to write Richard\nonce a week, making my faithful report of Ada, who was to write to\nhim every alternate day. I was to be informed, under his own hand, of\nall his labours and successes; I was to observe how resolute and\npersevering he would be; I was to be Ada's bridesmaid when they were\nmarried; I was to live with them afterwards; I was to keep all the\nkeys of their house; I was to be made happy for ever and a day.\n\n\"And if the suit SHOULD make us rich, Esther--which it may, you\nknow!\" said Richard to crown all.\n\nA shade crossed Ada's face.\n\n\"My dearest Ada,\" asked Richard, \"why not?\"\n\n\"It had better declare us poor at once,\" said Ada.\n\n\"Oh! I don't know about that,\" returned Richard, \"but at all events,\nit won't declare anything at once. It hasn't declared anything in\nheaven knows how many years.\"\n\n\"Too true,\" said Ada.\n\n\"Yes, but,\" urged Richard, answering what her look suggested rather\nthan her words, \"the longer it goes on, dear cousin, the nearer it\nmust be to a settlement one way or other. Now, is not that\nreasonable?\"\n\n\"You know best, Richard. But I am afraid if we trust to it, it will\nmake us unhappy.\"\n\n\"But, my Ada, we are not going to trust to it!\" cried Richard gaily.\n\"We know it better than to trust to it. We only say that if it SHOULD\nmake us rich, we have no constitutional objection to being rich. The\ncourt is, by solemn settlement of law, our grim old guardian, and we\nare to suppose that what it gives us (when it gives us anything) is\nour right. It is not necessary to quarrel with our right.\"\n\n\"No,\" said Ada, \"but it may be better to forget all about it.\"\n\n\"Well, well,\" cried Richard, \"then we will forget all about it! We\nconsign the whole thing to oblivion. Dame Durden puts on her\napproving face, and it's done!\"\n\n\"Dame Durden's approving face,\" said I, looking out of the box in\nwhich I was packing his books, \"was not very visible when you called\nit by that name; but it does approve, and she thinks you can't do\nbetter.\"\n\nSo, Richard said there was an end of it, and immediately began, on no\nother foundation, to build as many castles in the air as would man\nthe Great Wall of China. He went away in high spirits. Ada and I,\nprepared to miss him very much, commenced our quieter career.\n\nOn our arrival in London, we had called with Mr. Jarndyce at Mrs.\nJellyby's but had not been so fortunate as to find her at home. It\nappeared that she had gone somewhere to a tea-drinking and had taken\nMiss Jellyby with her. Besides the tea-drinking, there was to be some\nconsiderable speech-making and letter-writing on the general merits\nof the cultivation of coffee, conjointly with natives, at the\nSettlement of Borrioboola-Gha. All this involved, no doubt,\nsufficient active exercise of pen and ink to make her daughter's part\nin the proceedings anything but a holiday.\n\nIt being now beyond the time appointed for Mrs. Jellyby's return, we\ncalled again. She was in town, but not at home, having gone to Mile\nEnd directly after breakfast on some Borrioboolan business, arising\nout of a society called the East London Branch Aid Ramification. As I\nhad not seen Peepy on the occasion of our last call (when he was not\nto be found anywhere, and when the cook rather thought he must have\nstrolled away with the dustman's cart), I now inquired for him again.\nThe oyster shells he had been building a house with were still in the\npassage, but he was nowhere discoverable, and the cook supposed that\nhe had \"gone after the sheep.\" When we repeated, with some surprise,\n\"The sheep?\" she said, Oh, yes, on market days he sometimes followed\nthem quite out of town and came back in such a state as never was!\n\nI was sitting at the window with my guardian on the following\nmorning, and Ada was busy writing--of course to Richard--when Miss\nJellyby was announced, and entered, leading the identical Peepy, whom\nshe had made some endeavours to render presentable by wiping the dirt\ninto corners of his face and hands and making his hair very wet and\nthen violently frizzling it with her fingers. Everything the dear\nchild wore was either too large for him or too small. Among his other\ncontradictory decorations he had the hat of a bishop and the little\ngloves of a baby. His boots were, on a small scale, the boots of a\nploughman, while his legs, so crossed and recrossed with scratches\nthat they looked like maps, were bare below a very short pair of\nplaid drawers finished off with two frills of perfectly different\npatterns. The deficient buttons on his plaid frock had evidently been\nsupplied from one of Mr. Jellyby's coats, they were so extremely\nbrazen and so much too large. Most extraordinary specimens of\nneedlework appeared on several parts of his dress, where it had been\nhastily mended, and I recognized the same hand on Miss Jellyby's. She\nwas, however, unaccountably improved in her appearance and looked\nvery pretty. She was conscious of poor little Peepy being but a\nfailure after all her trouble, and she showed it as she came in by\nthe way in which she glanced first at him and then at us.\n\n\"Oh, dear me!\" said my guardian. \"Due east!\"\n\nAda and I gave her a cordial welcome and presented her to Mr.\nJarndyce, to whom she said as she sat down, \"Ma's compliments, and\nshe hopes you'll excuse her, because she's correcting proofs of the\nplan. She's going to put out five thousand new circulars, and she\nknows you'll be interested to hear that. I have brought one of them\nwith me. Ma's compliments.\" With which she presented it sulkily\nenough.\n\n\"Thank you,\" said my guardian. \"I am much obliged to Mrs. Jellyby.\nOh, dear me! This is a very trying wind!\"\n\nWe were busy with Peepy, taking off his clerical hat, asking him if\nhe remembered us, and so on. Peepy retired behind his elbow at first,\nbut relented at the sight of sponge-cake and allowed me to take him\non my lap, where he sat munching quietly. Mr. Jarndyce then\nwithdrawing into the temporary growlery, Miss Jellyby opened a\nconversation with her usual abruptness.\n\n\"We are going on just as bad as ever in Thavies Inn,\" said she. \"I\nhave no peace of my life. Talk of Africa! I couldn't be worse off if\nI was a what's-his-name--man and a brother!\"\n\nI tried to say something soothing.\n\n\"Oh, it's of no use, Miss Summerson,\" exclaimed Miss Jellyby, \"though\nI thank you for the kind intention all the same. I know how I am\nused, and I am not to be talked over. YOU wouldn't be talked over if\nyou were used so. Peepy, go and play at Wild Beasts under the piano!\"\n\n\"I shan't!\" said Peepy.\n\n\"Very well, you ungrateful, naughty, hard-hearted boy!\" returned Miss\nJellyby with tears in her eyes. \"I'll never take pains to dress you\nany more.\"\n\n\"Yes, I will go, Caddy!\" cried Peepy, who was really a good child and\nwho was so moved by his sister's vexation that he went at once.\n\n\"It seems a little thing to cry about,\" said poor Miss Jellyby\napologetically, \"but I am quite worn out. I was directing the new\ncirculars till two this morning. I detest the whole thing so that\nthat alone makes my head ache till I can't see out of my eyes. And\nlook at that poor unfortunate child! Was there ever such a fright as\nhe is!\"\n\nPeepy, happily unconscious of the defects in his appearance, sat on\nthe carpet behind one of the legs of the piano, looking calmly out of\nhis den at us while he ate his cake.\n\n\"I have sent him to the other end of the room,\" observed Miss\nJellyby, drawing her chair nearer ours, \"because I don't want him to\nhear the conversation. Those little things are so sharp! I was going\nto say, we really are going on worse than ever. Pa will be a bankrupt\nbefore long, and then I hope Ma will be satisfied. There'll he nobody\nbut Ma to thank for it.\"\n\nWe said we hoped Mr. Jellyby's affairs were not in so bad a state as\nthat.\n\n\"It's of no use hoping, though it's very kind of you,\" returned Miss\nJellyby, shaking her head. \"Pa told me only yesterday morning (and\ndreadfully unhappy he is) that he couldn't weather the storm. I\nshould be surprised if he could. When all our tradesmen send into our\nhouse any stuff they like, and the servants do what they like with\nit, and I have no time to improve things if I knew how, and Ma don't\ncare about anything, I should like to make out how Pa is to weather\nthe storm. I declare if I was Pa, I'd run away.\"\n\n\"My dear!\" said I, smiling. \"Your papa, no doubt, considers his\nfamily.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, his family is all very fine, Miss Summerson,\" replied Miss\nJellyby; \"but what comfort is his family to him? His family is\nnothing but bills, dirt, waste, noise, tumbles downstairs, confusion,\nand wretchedness. His scrambling home, from week's end to week's end,\nis like one great washing-day--only nothing's washed!\"\n\nMiss Jellyby tapped her foot upon the floor and wiped her eyes.\n\n\"I am sure I pity Pa to that degree,\" she said, \"and am so angry with\nMa that I can't find words to express myself! However, I am not going\nto bear it, I am determined. I won't be a slave all my life, and I\nwon't submit to be proposed to by Mr. Quale. A pretty thing, indeed,\nto marry a philanthropist. As if I hadn't had enough of THAT!\" said\npoor Miss Jellyby.\n\nI must confess that I could not help feeling rather angry with Mrs.\nJellyby myself, seeing and hearing this neglected girl and knowing\nhow much of bitterly satirical truth there was in what she said.\n\n\"If it wasn't that we had been intimate when you stopped at our\nhouse,\" pursued Miss Jellyby, \"I should have been ashamed to come\nhere to-day, for I know what a figure I must seem to you two. But as\nit is, I made up my mind to call, especially as I am not likely to\nsee you again the next time you come to town.\"\n\nShe said this with such great significance that Ada and I glanced at\none another, foreseeing something more.\n\n\"No!\" said Miss Jellyby, shaking her head. \"Not at all likely! I know\nI may trust you two. I am sure you won't betray me. I am engaged.\"\n\n\"Without their knowledge at home?\" said I.\n\n\"Why, good gracious me, Miss Summerson,\" she returned, justifying\nherself in a fretful but not angry manner, \"how can it be otherwise?\nYou know what Ma is--and I needn't make poor Pa more miserable by\ntelling HIM.\"\n\n\"But would it not be adding to his unhappiness to marry without his\nknowledge or consent, my dear?\" said I.\n\n\"No,\" said Miss Jellyby, softening. \"I hope not. I should try to make\nhim happy and comfortable when he came to see me, and Peepy and the\nothers should take it in turns to come and stay with me, and they\nshould have some care taken of them then.\"\n\nThere was a good deal of affection in poor Caddy. She softened more\nand more while saying this and cried so much over the unwonted little\nhome-picture she had raised in her mind that Peepy, in his cave under\nthe piano, was touched, and turned himself over on his back with loud\nlamentations. It was not until I had brought him to kiss his sister,\nand had restored him to his place on my lap, and had shown him that\nCaddy was laughing (she laughed expressly for the purpose), that we\ncould recall his peace of mind; even then it was for some time\nconditional on his taking us in turns by the chin and smoothing our\nfaces all over with his hand. At last, as his spirits were not equal\nto the piano, we put him on a chair to look out of window; and Miss\nJellyby, holding him by one leg, resumed her confidence.\n\n\"It began in your coming to our house,\" she said.\n\nWe naturally asked how.\n\n\"I felt I was so awkward,\" she replied, \"that I made up my mind to be\nimproved in that respect at all events and to learn to dance. I told\nMa I was ashamed of myself, and I must be taught to dance. Ma looked\nat me in that provoking way of hers as if I wasn't in sight, but I\nwas quite determined to be taught to dance, and so I went to Mr.\nTurveydrop's Academy in Newman Street.\"\n\n\"And was it there, my dear--\" I began.\n\n\"Yes, it was there,\" said Caddy, \"and I am engaged to Mr. Turveydrop.\nThere are two Mr. Turveydrops, father and son. My Mr. Turveydrop is\nthe son, of course. I only wish I had been better brought up and was\nlikely to make him a better wife, for I am very fond of him.\"\n\n\"I am sorry to hear this,\" said I, \"I must confess.\"\n\n\"I don't know why you should be sorry,\" she retorted a little\nanxiously, \"but I am engaged to Mr. Turveydrop, whether or no, and he\nis very fond of me. It's a secret as yet, even on his side, because\nold Mr. Turveydrop has a share in the connexion and it might break\nhis heart or give him some other shock if he was told of it abruptly.\nOld Mr. Turveydrop is a very gentlemanly man indeed--very\ngentlemanly.\"\n\n\"Does his wife know of it?\" asked Ada.\n\n\"Old Mr. Turveydrop's wife, Miss Clare?\" returned Miss Jellyby,\nopening her eyes. \"There's no such person. He is a widower.\"\n\nWe were here interrupted by Peepy, whose leg had undergone so much on\naccount of his sister's unconsciously jerking it like a bell-rope\nwhenever she was emphatic that the afflicted child now bemoaned his\nsufferings with a very low-spirited noise. As he appealed to me for\ncompassion, and as I was only a listener, I undertook to hold him.\nMiss Jellyby proceeded, after begging Peepy's pardon with a kiss and\nassuring him that she hadn't meant to do it.\n\n\"That's the state of the case,\" said Caddy. \"If I ever blame myself,\nI still think it's Ma's fault. We are to be married whenever we can,\nand then I shall go to Pa at the office and write to Ma. It won't\nmuch agitate Ma; I am only pen and ink to HER. One great comfort is,\"\nsaid Caddy with a sob, \"that I shall never hear of Africa after I am\nmarried. Young Mr. Turveydrop hates it for my sake, and if old Mr.\nTurveydrop knows there is such a place, it's as much as he does.\"\n\n\"It was he who was very gentlemanly, I think!\" said I.\n\n\"Very gentlemanly indeed,\" said Caddy. \"He is celebrated almost\neverywhere for his deportment.\"\n\n\"Does he teach?\" asked Ada.\n\n\"No, he don't teach anything in particular,\" replied Caddy. \"But his\ndeportment is beautiful.\"\n\nCaddy went on to say with considerable hesitation and reluctance that\nthere was one thing more she wished us to know, and felt we ought to\nknow, and which she hoped would not offend us. It was that she had\nimproved her acquaintance with Miss Flite, the little crazy old lady,\nand that she frequently went there early in the morning and met her\nlover for a few minutes before breakfast--only for a few minutes. \"I\ngo there at other times,\" said Caddy, \"but Prince does not come then.\nYoung Mr. Turveydrop's name is Prince; I wish it wasn't, because it\nsounds like a dog, but of course he didn't christen himself. Old Mr.\nTurveydrop had him christened Prince in remembrance of the Prince\nRegent. Old Mr. Turveydrop adored the Prince Regent on account of his\ndeportment. I hope you won't think the worse of me for having made\nthese little appointments at Miss Flite's, where I first went with\nyou, because I like the poor thing for her own sake and I believe she\nlikes me. If you could see young Mr. Turveydrop, I am sure you would\nthink well of him--at least, I am sure you couldn't possibly think\nany ill of him. I am going there now for my lesson. I couldn't ask\nyou to go with me, Miss Summerson; but if you would,\" said Caddy, who\nhad said all this earnestly and tremblingly, \"I should be very\nglad--very glad.\"\n\nIt happened that we had arranged with my guardian to go to Miss\nFlite's that day. We had told him of our former visit, and our\naccount had interested him; but something had always happened to\nprevent our going there again. As I trusted that I might have\nsufficient influence with Miss Jellyby to prevent her taking any very\nrash step if I fully accepted the confidence she was so willing to\nplace in me, poor girl, I proposed that she and I and Peepy should go\nto the academy and afterwards meet my guardian and Ada at Miss\nFlite's, whose name I now learnt for the first time. This was on\ncondition that Miss Jellyby and Peepy should come back with us to\ndinner. The last article of the agreement being joyfully acceded to\nby both, we smartened Peepy up a little with the assistance of a few\npins, some soap and water, and a hair-brush, and went out, bending\nour steps towards Newman Street, which was very near.\n\nI found the academy established in a sufficiently dingy house at the\ncorner of an archway, with busts in all the staircase windows. In the\nsame house there were also established, as I gathered from the plates\non the door, a drawing-master, a coal-merchant (there was, certainly,\nno room for his coals), and a lithographic artist. On the plate\nwhich, in size and situation, took precedence of all the rest, I\nread, MR. TURVEYDROP. The door was open, and the hall was blocked up\nby a grand piano, a harp, and several other musical instruments in\ncases, all in progress of removal, and all looking rakish in the\ndaylight. Miss Jellyby informed me that the academy had been lent,\nlast night, for a concert.\n\nWe went upstairs--it had been quite a fine house once, when it was\nanybody's business to keep it clean and fresh, and nobody's business\nto smoke in it all day--and into Mr. Turveydrop's great room, which\nwas built out into a mews at the back and was lighted by a skylight.\nIt was a bare, resounding room smelling of stables, with cane forms\nalong the walls, and the walls ornamented at regular intervals with\npainted lyres and little cut-glass branches for candles, which seemed\nto be shedding their old-fashioned drops as other branches might shed\nautumn leaves. Several young lady pupils, ranging from thirteen or\nfourteen years of age to two or three and twenty, were assembled; and\nI was looking among them for their instructor when Caddy, pinching my\narm, repeated the ceremony of introduction. \"Miss Summerson, Mr.\nPrince Turveydrop!\"\n\nI curtsied to a little blue-eyed fair man of youthful appearance with\nflaxen hair parted in the middle and curling at the ends all round\nhis head. He had a little fiddle, which we used to call at school a\nkit, under his left arm, and its little bow in the same hand. His\nlittle dancing-shoes were particularly diminutive, and he had a\nlittle innocent, feminine manner which not only appealed to me in an\namiable way, but made this singular effect upon me, that I received\nthe impression that he was like his mother and that his mother had\nnot been much considered or well used.\n\n\"I am very happy to see Miss Jellyby's friend,\" he said, bowing low\nto me. \"I began to fear,\" with timid tenderness, \"as it was past the\nusual time, that Miss Jellyby was not coming.\"\n\n\"I beg you will have the goodness to attribute that to me, who have\ndetained her, and to receive my excuses, sir,\" said I.\n\n\"Oh, dear!\" said he.\n\n\"And pray,\" I entreated, \"do not allow me to be the cause of any more\ndelay.\"\n\nWith that apology I withdrew to a seat between Peepy (who, being well\nused to it, had already climbed into a corner place) and an old lady\nof a censorious countenance whose two nieces were in the class and\nwho was very indignant with Peepy's boots. Prince Turveydrop then\ntinkled the strings of his kit with his fingers, and the young ladies\nstood up to dance. Just then there appeared from a side-door old Mr.\nTurveydrop, in the full lustre of his deportment.\n\nHe was a fat old gentleman with a false complexion, false teeth,\nfalse whiskers, and a wig. He had a fur collar, and he had a padded\nbreast to his coat, which only wanted a star or a broad blue ribbon\nto be complete. He was pinched in, and swelled out, and got up, and\nstrapped down, as much as he could possibly bear. He had such a\nneckcloth on (puffing his very eyes out of their natural shape), and\nhis chin and even his ears so sunk into it, that it seemed as though\nhe must inevitably double up if it were cast loose. He had under his\narm a hat of great size and weight, shelving downward from the crown\nto the brim, and in his hand a pair of white gloves with which he\nflapped it as he stood poised on one leg in a high-shouldered,\nround-elbowed state of elegance not to be surpassed. He had a cane,\nhe had an eye-glass, he had a snuff-box, he had rings, he had\nwristbands, he had everything but any touch of nature; he was not\nlike youth, he was not like age, he was not like anything in the\nworld but a model of deportment.\n\n\"Father! A visitor. Miss Jellyby's friend, Miss Summerson.\"\n\n\"Distinguished,\" said Mr. Turveydrop, \"by Miss Summerson's presence.\"\nAs he bowed to me in that tight state, I almost believe I saw creases\ncome into the whites of his eyes.\n\n\"My father,\" said the son, aside, to me with quite an affecting\nbelief in him, \"is a celebrated character. My father is greatly\nadmired.\"\n\n\"Go on, Prince! Go on!\" said Mr. Turveydrop, standing with his back\nto the fire and waving his gloves condescendingly. \"Go on, my son!\"\n\nAt this command, or by this gracious permission, the lesson went on.\nPrince Turveydrop sometimes played the kit, dancing; sometimes played\nthe piano, standing; sometimes hummed the tune with what little\nbreath he could spare, while he set a pupil right; always\nconscientiously moved with the least proficient through every step\nand every part of the figure; and never rested for an instant. His\ndistinguished father did nothing whatever but stand before the fire,\na model of deportment.\n\n\"And he never does anything else,\" said the old lady of the\ncensorious countenance. \"Yet would you believe that it's HIS name on\nthe door-plate?\"\n\n\"His son's name is the same, you know,\" said I.\n\n\"He wouldn't let his son have any name if he could take it from him,\"\nreturned the old lady. \"Look at the son's dress!\" It certainly was\nplain--threadbare--almost shabby. \"Yet the father must be garnished\nand tricked out,\" said the old lady, \"because of his deportment. I'd\ndeport him! Transport him would be better!\"\n\nI felt curious to know more concerning this person. I asked, \"Does he\ngive lessons in deportment now?\"\n\n\"Now!\" returned the old lady shortly. \"Never did.\"\n\nAfter a moment's consideration, I suggested that perhaps fencing had\nbeen his accomplishment.\n\n\"I don't believe he can fence at all, ma'am,\" said the old lady.\n\nI looked surprised and inquisitive. The old lady, becoming more and\nmore incensed against the master of deportment as she dwelt upon the\nsubject, gave me some particulars of his career, with strong\nassurances that they were mildly stated.\n\nHe had married a meek little dancing-mistress, with a tolerable\nconnexion (having never in his life before done anything but deport\nhimself), and had worked her to death, or had, at the best, suffered\nher to work herself to death, to maintain him in those expenses which\nwere indispensable to his position. At once to exhibit his deportment\nto the best models and to keep the best models constantly before\nhimself, he had found it necessary to frequent all public places of\nfashionable and lounging resort, to be seen at Brighton and elsewhere\nat fashionable times, and to lead an idle life in the very best\nclothes. To enable him to do this, the affectionate little\ndancing-mistress had toiled and laboured and would have toiled and\nlaboured to that hour if her strength had lasted so long. For the\nmainspring of the story was that in spite of the man's absorbing\nselfishness, his wife (overpowered by his deportment) had, to the\nlast, believed in him and had, on her death-bed, in the most moving\nterms, confided him to their son as one who had an inextinguishable\nclaim upon him and whom he could never regard with too much pride and\ndeference. The son, inheriting his mother's belief, and having the\ndeportment always before him, had lived and grown in the same faith,\nand now, at thirty years of age, worked for his father twelve hours a\nday and looked up to him with veneration on the old imaginary\npinnacle.\n\n\"The airs the fellow gives himself!\" said my informant, shaking her\nhead at old Mr. Turveydrop with speechless indignation as he drew on\nhis tight gloves, of course unconscious of the homage she was\nrendering. \"He fully believes he is one of the aristocracy! And he is\nso condescending to the son he so egregiously deludes that you might\nsuppose him the most virtuous of parents. Oh!\" said the old lady,\napostrophizing him with infinite vehemence. \"I could bite you!\"\n\nI could not help being amused, though I heard the old lady out with\nfeelings of real concern. It was difficult to doubt her with the\nfather and son before me. What I might have thought of them without\nthe old lady's account, or what I might have thought of the old\nlady's account without them, I cannot say. There was a fitness of\nthings in the whole that carried conviction with it.\n\nMy eyes were yet wandering, from young Mr. Turveydrop working so\nhard, to old Mr. Turveydrop deporting himself so beautifully, when\nthe latter came ambling up to me and entered into conversation.\n\nHe asked me, first of all, whether I conferred a charm and a\ndistinction on London by residing in it? I did not think it necessary\nto reply that I was perfectly aware I should not do that, in any\ncase, but merely told him where I did reside.\n\n\"A lady so graceful and accomplished,\" he said, kissing his\nright glove and afterwards extending it towards the pupils,\n\"will look leniently on the deficiencies here. We do our best to\npolish--polish--polish!\"\n\nHe sat down beside me, taking some pains to sit on the form, I\nthought, in imitation of the print of his illustrious model on the\nsofa. And really he did look very like it.\n\n\"To polish--polish--polish!\" he repeated, taking a pinch of snuff and\ngently fluttering his fingers. \"But we are not, if I may say so to\none formed to be graceful both by Nature and Art--\" with the\nhigh-shouldered bow, which it seemed impossible for him to make\nwithout lifting up his eyebrows and shutting his eyes \"--we are not\nwhat we used to be in point of deportment.\"\n\n\"Are we not, sir?\" said I.\n\n\"We have degenerated,\" he returned, shaking his head, which he could\ndo to a very limited extent in his cravat. \"A levelling age is not\nfavourable to deportment. It develops vulgarity. Perhaps I speak with\nsome little partiality. It may not be for me to say that I have been\ncalled, for some years now, Gentleman Turveydrop, or that his Royal\nHighness the Prince Regent did me the honour to inquire, on my\nremoving my hat as he drove out of the Pavilion at Brighton (that\nfine building), 'Who is he? Who the devil is he? Why don't I know\nhim? Why hasn't he thirty thousand a year?' But these are little\nmatters of anecdote--the general property, ma'am--still repeated\noccasionally among the upper classes.\"\n\n\"Indeed?\" said I.\n\nHe replied with the high-shouldered bow. \"Where what is left among us\nof deportment,\" he added, \"still lingers. England--alas, my\ncountry!--has degenerated very much, and is degenerating every day.\nShe has not many gentlemen left. We are few. I see nothing to succeed\nus but a race of weavers.\"\n\n\"One might hope that the race of gentlemen would be perpetuated\nhere,\" said I.\n\n\"You are very good.\" He smiled with a high-shouldered bow again. \"You\nflatter me. But, no--no! I have never been able to imbue my poor boy\nwith that part of his art. Heaven forbid that I should disparage my\ndear child, but he has--no deportment.\"\n\n\"He appears to be an excellent master,\" I observed.\n\n\"Understand me, my dear madam, he IS an excellent master. All that\ncan be acquired, he has acquired. All that can be imparted, he can\nimpart. But there ARE things--\" He took another pinch of snuff and\nmade the bow again, as if to add, \"This kind of thing, for instance.\"\n\nI glanced towards the centre of the room, where Miss Jellyby's lover,\nnow engaged with single pupils, was undergoing greater drudgery than\never.\n\n\"My amiable child,\" murmured Mr. Turveydrop, adjusting his cravat.\n\n\"Your son is indefatigable,\" said I.\n\n\"It is my reward,\" said Mr. Turveydrop, \"to hear you say so. In some\nrespects, he treads in the footsteps of his sainted mother. She was a\ndevoted creature. But wooman, lovely wooman,\" said Mr. Turveydrop\nwith very disagreeable gallantry, \"what a sex you are!\"\n\nI rose and joined Miss Jellyby, who was by this time putting on her\nbonnet. The time allotted to a lesson having fully elapsed, there was\na general putting on of bonnets. When Miss Jellyby and the\nunfortunate Prince found an opportunity to become betrothed I don't\nknow, but they certainly found none on this occasion to exchange a\ndozen words.\n\n\"My dear,\" said Mr. Turveydrop benignly to his son, \"do you know the\nhour?\"\n\n\"No, father.\" The son had no watch. The father had a handsome gold\none, which he pulled out with an air that was an example to mankind.\n\n\"My son,\" said he, \"it's two o'clock. Recollect your school at\nKensington at three.\"\n\n\"That's time enough for me, father,\" said Prince. \"I can take a\nmorsel of dinner standing and be off.\"\n\n\"My dear boy,\" returned his father, \"you must be very quick. You will\nfind the cold mutton on the table.\"\n\n\"Thank you, father. Are YOU off now, father?\"\n\n\"Yes, my dear. I suppose,\" said Mr. Turveydrop, shutting his eyes and\nlifting up his shoulders with modest consciousness, \"that I must show\nmyself, as usual, about town.\"\n\n\"You had better dine out comfortably somewhere,\" said his son.\n\n\"My dear child, I intend to. I shall take my little meal, I think, at\nthe French house, in the Opera Colonnade.\"\n\n\"That's right. Good-bye, father!\" said Prince, shaking hands.\n\n\"Good-bye, my son. Bless you!\"\n\nMr. Turveydrop said this in quite a pious manner, and it seemed to do\nhis son good, who, in parting from him, was so pleased with him, so\ndutiful to him, and so proud of him that I almost felt as if it were\nan unkindness to the younger man not to be able to believe implicitly\nin the elder. The few moments that were occupied by Prince in taking\nleave of us (and particularly of one of us, as I saw, being in the\nsecret), enhanced my favourable impression of his almost childish\ncharacter. I felt a liking for him and a compassion for him as he put\nhis little kit in his pocket--and with it his desire to stay a little\nwhile with Caddy--and went away good-humouredly to his cold mutton\nand his school at Kensington, that made me scarcely less irate with\nhis father than the censorious old lady.\n\nThe father opened the room door for us and bowed us out in a manner,\nI must acknowledge, worthy of his shining original. In the same style\nhe presently passed us on the other side of the street, on his way to\nthe aristocratic part of the town, where he was going to show himself\namong the few other gentlemen left. For some moments, I was so lost\nin reconsidering what I had heard and seen in Newman Street that I\nwas quite unable to talk to Caddy or even to fix my attention on what\nshe said to me, especially when I began to inquire in my mind whether\nthere were, or ever had been, any other gentlemen, not in the dancing\nprofession, who lived and founded a reputation entirely on their\ndeportment. This became so bewildering and suggested the possibility\nof so many Mr. Turveydrops that I said, \"Esther, you must make up\nyour mind to abandon this subject altogether and attend to Caddy.\" I\naccordingly did so, and we chatted all the rest of the way to\nLincoln's Inn.\n\nCaddy told me that her lover's education had been so neglected that\nit was not always easy to read his notes. She said if he were not so\nanxious about his spelling and took less pains to make it clear, he\nwould do better; but he put so many unnecessary letters into short\nwords that they sometimes quite lost their English appearance. \"He\ndoes it with the best intention,\" observed Caddy, \"but it hasn't the\neffect he means, poor fellow!\" Caddy then went on to reason, how\ncould he be expected to be a scholar when he had passed his whole\nlife in the dancing-school and had done nothing but teach and fag,\nfag and teach, morning, noon, and night! And what did it matter? She\ncould write letters enough for both, as she knew to her cost, and it\nwas far better for him to be amiable than learned. \"Besides, it's not\nas if I was an accomplished girl who had any right to give herself\nairs,\" said Caddy. \"I know little enough, I am sure, thanks to Ma!\n\n\"There's another thing I want to tell you, now we are alone,\"\ncontinued Caddy, \"which I should not have liked to mention unless you\nhad seen Prince, Miss Summerson. You know what a house ours is. It's\nof no use my trying to learn anything that it would be useful for\nPrince's wife to know in OUR house. We live in such a state of muddle\nthat it's impossible, and I have only been more disheartened whenever\nI have tried. So I get a little practice with--who do you think? Poor\nMiss Flite! Early in the morning I help her to tidy her room and\nclean her birds, and I make her cup of coffee for her (of course she\ntaught me), and I have learnt to make it so well that Prince says\nit's the very best coffee he ever tasted, and would quite delight old\nMr. Turveydrop, who is very particular indeed about his coffee. I can\nmake little puddings too; and I know how to buy neck of mutton, and\ntea, and sugar, and butter, and a good many housekeeping things. I am\nnot clever at my needle, yet,\" said Caddy, glancing at the repairs on\nPeepy's frock, \"but perhaps I shall improve, and since I have been\nengaged to Prince and have been doing all this, I have felt\nbetter-tempered, I hope, and more forgiving to Ma. It rather put me\nout at first this morning to see you and Miss Clare looking so neat\nand pretty and to feel ashamed of Peepy and myself too, but on the\nwhole I hope I am better-tempered than I was and more forgiving to\nMa.\"\n\nThe poor girl, trying so hard, said it from her heart, and touched\nmine. \"Caddy, my love,\" I replied, \"I begin to have a great affection\nfor you, and I hope we shall become friends.\"\n\n\"Oh, do you?\" cried Caddy. \"How happy that would make me!\"\n\n\"My dear Caddy,\" said I, \"let us be friends from this time, and let\nus often have a chat about these matters and try to find the right\nway through them.\" Caddy was overjoyed. I said everything I could in\nmy old-fashioned way to comfort and encourage her, and I would not\nhave objected to old Mr. Turveydrop that day for any smaller\nconsideration than a settlement on his daughter-in-law.\n\nBy this time we were come to Mr. Krook's, whose private door stood\nopen. There was a bill, pasted on the door-post, announcing a room to\nlet on the second floor. It reminded Caddy to tell me as we proceeded\nupstairs that there had been a sudden death there and an inquest and\nthat our little friend had been ill of the fright. The door and\nwindow of the vacant room being open, we looked in. It was the room\nwith the dark door to which Miss Flite had secretly directed my\nattention when I was last in the house. A sad and desolate place it\nwas, a gloomy, sorrowful place that gave me a strange sensation of\nmournfulness and even dread. \"You look pale,\" said Caddy when we came\nout, \"and cold!\" I felt as if the room had chilled me.\n\nWe had walked slowly while we were talking, and my guardian and Ada\nwere here before us. We found them in Miss Flite's garret. They were\nlooking at the birds, while a medical gentleman who was so good as to\nattend Miss Flite with much solicitude and compassion spoke with her\ncheerfully by the fire.\n\n\"I have finished my professional visit,\" he said, coming forward.\n\"Miss Flite is much better and may appear in court (as her mind is\nset upon it) to-morrow. She has been greatly missed there, I\nunderstand.\"\n\nMiss Flite received the compliment with complacency and dropped a\ngeneral curtsy to us.\n\n\"Honoured, indeed,\" said she, \"by another visit from the wards in\nJarndyce! Ve-ry happy to receive Jarndyce of Bleak House beneath my\nhumble roof!\" with a special curtsy. \"Fitz-Jarndyce, my dear\"--she\nhad bestowed that name on Caddy, it appeared, and always called her\nby it--\"a double welcome!\"\n\n\"Has she been very ill?\" asked Mr. Jarndyce of the gentleman whom we\nhad found in attendance on her. She answered for herself directly,\nthough he had put the question in a whisper.\n\n\"Oh, decidedly unwell! Oh, very unwell indeed,\" she said\nconfidentially. \"Not pain, you know--trouble. Not bodily so much as\nnervous, nervous! The truth is,\" in a subdued voice and trembling,\n\"we have had death here. There was poison in the house. I am very\nsusceptible to such horrid things. It frightened me. Only Mr.\nWoodcourt knows how much. My physician, Mr. Woodcourt!\" with\ngreat stateliness. \"The wards in Jarndyce--Jarndyce of Bleak\nHouse--Fitz-Jarndyce!\"\n\n\"Miss Flite,\" said Mr. Woodcourt in a grave kind of voice, as if he\nwere appealing to her while speaking to us, and laying his hand\ngently on her arm, \"Miss Flite describes her illness with her usual\naccuracy. She was alarmed by an occurrence in the house which might\nhave alarmed a stronger person, and was made ill by the distress and\nagitation. She brought me here in the first hurry of the discovery,\nthough too late for me to be of any use to the unfortunate man. I\nhave compensated myself for that disappointment by coming here since\nand being of some small use to her.\"\n\n\"The kindest physician in the college,\" whispered Miss Flite to me.\n\"I expect a judgment. On the day of judgment. And shall then confer\nestates.\"\n\n\"She will be as well in a day or two,\" said Mr. Woodcourt, looking at\nher with an observant smile, \"as she ever will be. In other words,\nquite well of course. Have you heard of her good fortune?\"\n\n\"Most extraordinary!\" said Miss Flite, smiling brightly. \"You never\nheard of such a thing, my dear! Every Saturday, Conversation Kenge or\nGuppy (clerk to Conversation K.) places in my hand a paper of\nshillings. Shillings. I assure you! Always the same number in the\npaper. Always one for every day in the week. Now you know, really! So\nwell-timed, is it not? Ye-es! From whence do these papers come, you\nsay? That is the great question. Naturally. Shall I tell you what I\nthink? I think,\" said Miss Flite, drawing herself back with a very\nshrewd look and shaking her right forefinger in a most significant\nmanner, \"that the Lord Chancellor, aware of the length of time during\nwhich the Great Seal has been open (for it has been open a long\ntime!), forwards them. Until the judgment I expect is given. Now\nthat's very creditable, you know. To confess in that way that he IS a\nlittle slow for human life. So delicate! Attending court the other\nday--I attend it regularly, with my documents--I taxed him with it,\nand he almost confessed. That is, I smiled at him from my bench, and\nHE smiled at me from his bench. But it's great good fortune, is it\nnot? And Fitz-Jarndyce lays the money out for me to great advantage.\nOh, I assure you to the greatest advantage!\"\n\nI congratulated her (as she addressed herself to me) upon this\nfortunate addition to her income and wished her a long continuance of\nit. I did not speculate upon the source from which it came or wonder\nwhose humanity was so considerate. My guardian stood before me,\ncontemplating the birds, and I had no need to look beyond him.\n\n\"And what do you call these little fellows, ma'am?\" said he in his\npleasant voice. \"Have they any names?\"\n\n\"I can answer for Miss Flite that they have,\" said I, \"for she\npromised to tell us what they were. Ada remembers?\"\n\nAda remembered very well.\n\n\"Did I?\" said Miss Flite. \"Who's that at my door? What are you\nlistening at my door for, Krook?\"\n\nThe old man of the house, pushing it open before him, appeared there\nwith his fur cap in his hand and his cat at his heels.\n\n\"I warn't listening, Miss Flite,\" he said, \"I was going to give a rap\nwith my knuckles, only you're so quick!\"\n\n\"Make your cat go down. Drive her away!\" the old lady angrily\nexclaimed.\n\n\"Bah, bah! There ain't no danger, gentlefolks,\" said Mr. Krook,\nlooking slowly and sharply from one to another until he had looked at\nall of us; \"she'd never offer at the birds when I was here unless I\ntold her to it.\"\n\n\"You will excuse my landlord,\" said the old lady with a dignified\nair. \"M, quite M! What do you want, Krook, when I have company?\"\n\n\"Hi!\" said the old man. \"You know I am the Chancellor.\"\n\n\"Well?\" returned Miss Flite. \"What of that?\"\n\n\"For the Chancellor,\" said the old man with a chuckle, \"not to be\nacquainted with a Jarndyce is queer, ain't it, Miss Flite? Mightn't I\ntake the liberty? Your servant, sir. I know Jarndyce and Jarndyce\na'most as well as you do, sir. I knowed old Squire Tom, sir. I never\nto my knowledge see you afore though, not even in court. Yet, I go\nthere a mortal sight of times in the course of the year, taking one\nday with another.\"\n\n\"I never go there,\" said Mr. Jarndyce (which he never did on any\nconsideration). \"I would sooner go--somewhere else.\"\n\n\"Would you though?\" returned Krook, grinning. \"You're bearing hard\nupon my noble and learned brother in your meaning, sir, though\nperhaps it is but nat'ral in a Jarndyce. The burnt child, sir! What,\nyou're looking at my lodger's birds, Mr. Jarndyce?\" The old man had\ncome by little and little into the room until he now touched my\nguardian with his elbow and looked close up into his face with his\nspectacled eyes. \"It's one of her strange ways that she'll never tell\nthe names of these birds if she can help it, though she named 'em\nall.\" This was in a whisper. \"Shall I run 'em over, Flite?\" he asked\naloud, winking at us and pointing at her as she turned away,\naffecting to sweep the grate.\n\n\"If you like,\" she answered hurriedly.\n\nThe old man, looking up at the cages after another look at us, went\nthrough the list.\n\n\"Hope, Joy, Youth, Peace, Rest, Life, Dust, Ashes, Waste, Want, Ruin,\nDespair, Madness, Death, Cunning, Folly, Words, Wigs, Rags,\nSheepskin, Plunder, Precedent, Jargon, Gammon, and Spinach. That's\nthe whole collection,\" said the old man, \"all cooped up together, by\nmy noble and learned brother.\"\n\n\"This is a bitter wind!\" muttered my guardian.\n\n\"When my noble and learned brother gives his judgment, they're to be\nlet go free,\" said Krook, winking at us again. \"And then,\" he added,\nwhispering and grinning, \"if that ever was to happen--which it\nwon't--the birds that have never been caged would kill 'em.\"\n\n\"If ever the wind was in the east,\" said my guardian, pretending to\nlook out of the window for a weathercock, \"I think it's there\nto-day!\"\n\nWe found it very difficult to get away from the house. It was not\nMiss Flite who detained us; she was as reasonable a little creature\nin consulting the convenience of others as there possibly could be.\nIt was Mr. Krook. He seemed unable to detach himself from Mr.\nJarndyce. If he had been linked to him, he could hardly have attended\nhim more closely. He proposed to show us his Court of Chancery and\nall the strange medley it contained; during the whole of our\ninspection (prolonged by himself) he kept close to Mr. Jarndyce and\nsometimes detained him under one pretence or other until we had\npassed on, as if he were tormented by an inclination to enter upon\nsome secret subject which he could not make up his mind to approach.\nI cannot imagine a countenance and manner more singularly expressive\nof caution and indecision, and a perpetual impulse to do something he\ncould not resolve to venture on, than Mr. Krook's was that day. His\nwatchfulness of my guardian was incessant. He rarely removed his eyes\nfrom his face. If he went on beside him, he observed him with the\nslyness of an old white fox. If he went before, he looked back. When\nwe stood still, he got opposite to him, and drawing his hand across\nand across his open mouth with a curious expression of a sense of\npower, and turning up his eyes, and lowering his grey eyebrows until\nthey appeared to be shut, seemed to scan every lineament of his face.\n\nAt last, having been (always attended by the cat) all over the house\nand having seen the whole stock of miscellaneous lumber, which was\ncertainly curious, we came into the back part of the shop. Here on\nthe head of an empty barrel stood on end were an ink-bottle, some old\nstumps of pens, and some dirty playbills; and against the wall were\npasted several large printed alphabets in several plain hands.\n\n\"What are you doing here?\" asked my guardian.\n\n\"Trying to learn myself to read and write,\" said Krook.\n\n\"And how do you get on?\"\n\n\"Slow. Bad,\" returned the old man impatiently. \"It's hard at my time\nof life.\"\n\n\"It would be easier to be taught by some one,\" said my guardian.\n\n\"Aye, but they might teach me wrong!\" returned the old man with a\nwonderfully suspicious flash of his eye. \"I don't know what I may\nhave lost by not being learned afore. I wouldn't like to lose\nanything by being learned wrong now.\"\n\n\"Wrong?\" said my guardian with his good-humoured smile. \"Who do you\nsuppose would teach you wrong?\"\n\n\"I don't know, Mr. Jarndyce of Bleak House!\" replied the old man,\nturning up his spectacles on his forehead and rubbing his hands. \"I\ndon't suppose as anybody would, but I'd rather trust my own self than\nanother!\"\n\nThese answers and his manner were strange enough to cause my guardian\nto inquire of Mr. Woodcourt, as we all walked across Lincoln's Inn\ntogether, whether Mr. Krook were really, as his lodger represented\nhim, deranged. The young surgeon replied, no, he had seen no reason\nto think so. He was exceedingly distrustful, as ignorance usually\nwas, and he was always more or less under the influence of raw gin,\nof which he drank great quantities and of which he and his back-shop,\nas we might have observed, smelt strongly; but he did not think him\nmad as yet.\n\nOn our way home, I so conciliated Peepy's affections by buying him a\nwindmill and two flour-sacks that he would suffer nobody else to take\noff his hat and gloves and would sit nowhere at dinner but at my\nside. Caddy sat upon the other side of me, next to Ada, to whom we\nimparted the whole history of the engagement as soon as we got back.\nWe made much of Caddy, and Peepy too; and Caddy brightened\nexceedingly; and my guardian was as merry as we were; and we were all\nvery happy indeed until Caddy went home at night in a hackney-coach,\nwith Peepy fast asleep, but holding tight to the windmill.\n\nI have forgotten to mention--at least I have not mentioned--that Mr.\nWoodcourt was the same dark young surgeon whom we had met at Mr.\nBadger's. Or that Mr. Jarndyce invited him to dinner that day. Or\nthat he came. Or that when they were all gone and I said to Ada,\n\"Now, my darling, let us have a little talk about Richard!\" Ada\nlaughed and said--\n\nBut I don't think it matters what my darling said. She was always\nmerry.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XV\n\nBell Yard\n\n\nWhile we were in London Mr. Jarndyce was constantly beset by the\ncrowd of excitable ladies and gentlemen whose proceedings had so much\nastonished us. Mr. Quale, who presented himself soon after our\narrival, was in all such excitements. He seemed to project those two\nshining knobs of temples of his into everything that went on and to\nbrush his hair farther and farther back, until the very roots were\nalmost ready to fly out of his head in inappeasable philanthropy. All\nobjects were alike to him, but he was always particularly ready for\nanything in the way of a testimonial to any one. His great power\nseemed to be his power of indiscriminate admiration. He would sit for\nany length of time, with the utmost enjoyment, bathing his temples in\nthe light of any order of luminary. Having first seen him perfectly\nswallowed up in admiration of Mrs. Jellyby, I had supposed her to be\nthe absorbing object of his devotion. I soon discovered my mistake\nand found him to be train-bearer and organ-blower to a whole\nprocession of people.\n\nMrs. Pardiggle came one day for a subscription to something, and with\nher, Mr. Quale. Whatever Mrs. Pardiggle said, Mr. Quale repeated to\nus; and just as he had drawn Mrs. Jellyby out, he drew Mrs. Pardiggle\nout. Mrs. Pardiggle wrote a letter of introduction to my guardian in\nbehalf of her eloquent friend Mr. Gusher. With Mr. Gusher appeared\nMr. Quale again. Mr. Gusher, being a flabby gentleman with a moist\nsurface and eyes so much too small for his moon of a face that they\nseemed to have been originally made for somebody else, was not at\nfirst sight prepossessing; yet he was scarcely seated before Mr.\nQuale asked Ada and me, not inaudibly, whether he was not a great\ncreature--which he certainly was, flabbily speaking, though Mr. Quale\nmeant in intellectual beauty--and whether we were not struck by his\nmassive configuration of brow. In short, we heard of a great many\nmissions of various sorts among this set of people, but nothing\nrespecting them was half so clear to us as that it was Mr. Quale's\nmission to be in ecstasies with everybody else's mission and that it\nwas the most popular mission of all.\n\nMr. Jarndyce had fallen into this company in the tenderness of his\nheart and his earnest desire to do all the good in his power; but\nthat he felt it to be too often an unsatisfactory company, where\nbenevolence took spasmodic forms, where charity was assumed as a\nregular uniform by loud professors and speculators in cheap\nnotoriety, vehement in profession, restless and vain in action,\nservile in the last degree of meanness to the great, adulatory of one\nanother, and intolerable to those who were anxious quietly to help\nthe weak from failing rather than with a great deal of bluster and\nself-laudation to raise them up a little way when they were down, he\nplainly told us. When a testimonial was originated to Mr. Quale by\nMr. Gusher (who had already got one, originated by Mr. Quale), and\nwhen Mr. Gusher spoke for an hour and a half on the subject to a\nmeeting, including two charity schools of small boys and girls, who\nwere specially reminded of the widow's mite, and requested to come\nforward with halfpence and be acceptable sacrifices, I think the wind\nwas in the east for three whole weeks.\n\nI mention this because I am coming to Mr. Skimpole again. It seemed\nto me that his off-hand professions of childishness and carelessness\nwere a great relief to my guardian, by contrast with such things, and\nwere the more readily believed in since to find one perfectly\nundesigning and candid man among many opposites could not fail to\ngive him pleasure. I should be sorry to imply that Mr. Skimpole\ndivined this and was politic; I really never understood him well\nenough to know. What he was to my guardian, he certainly was to the\nrest of the world.\n\nHe had not been very well; and thus, though he lived in London, we\nhad seen nothing of him until now. He appeared one morning in his\nusual agreeable way and as full of pleasant spirits as ever.\n\nWell, he said, here he was! He had been bilious, but rich men were\noften bilious, and therefore he had been persuading himself that he\nwas a man of property. So he was, in a certain point of view--in his\nexpansive intentions. He had been enriching his medical attendant in\nthe most lavish manner. He had always doubled, and sometimes\nquadrupled, his fees. He had said to the doctor, \"Now, my dear\ndoctor, it is quite a delusion on your part to suppose that you\nattend me for nothing. I am overwhelming you with money--in my\nexpansive intentions--if you only knew it!\" And really (he said) he\nmeant it to that degree that he thought it much the same as doing it.\nIf he had had those bits of metal or thin paper to which mankind\nattached so much importance to put in the doctor's hand, he would\nhave put them in the doctor's hand. Not having them, he substituted\nthe will for the deed. Very well! If he really meant it--if his will\nwere genuine and real, which it was--it appeared to him that it was\nthe same as coin, and cancelled the obligation.\n\n\"It may be, partly, because I know nothing of the value of money,\"\nsaid Mr. Skimpole, \"but I often feel this. It seems so reasonable! My\nbutcher says to me he wants that little bill. It's a part of the\npleasant unconscious poetry of the man's nature that he always calls\nit a 'little' bill--to make the payment appear easy to both of us. I\nreply to the butcher, 'My good friend, if you knew it, you are paid.\nYou haven't had the trouble of coming to ask for the little bill. You\nare paid. I mean it.'\"\n\n\"But, suppose,\" said my guardian, laughing, \"he had meant the meat in\nthe bill, instead of providing it?\"\n\n\"My dear Jarndyce,\" he returned, \"you surprise me. You take the\nbutcher's position. A butcher I once dealt with occupied that very\nground. Says he, 'Sir, why did you eat spring lamb at eighteen pence\na pound?' 'Why did I eat spring lamb at eighteen pence a pound, my\nhonest friend?' said I, naturally amazed by the question. 'I like\nspring lamb!' This was so far convincing. 'Well, sir,' says he, 'I\nwish I had meant the lamb as you mean the money!' 'My good fellow,'\nsaid I, 'pray let us reason like intellectual beings. How could that\nbe? It was impossible. You HAD got the lamb, and I have NOT got the\nmoney. You couldn't really mean the lamb without sending it in,\nwhereas I can, and do, really mean the money without paying it!' He\nhad not a word. There was an end of the subject.\"\n\n\"Did he take no legal proceedings?\" inquired my guardian.\n\n\"Yes, he took legal proceedings,\" said Mr. Skimpole. \"But in that he\nwas influenced by passion, not by reason. Passion reminds me of\nBoythorn. He writes me that you and the ladies have promised him a\nshort visit at his bachelor-house in Lincolnshire.\"\n\n\"He is a great favourite with my girls,\" said Mr. Jarndyce, \"and I\nhave promised for them.\"\n\n\"Nature forgot to shade him off, I think,\" observed Mr. Skimpole to\nAda and me. \"A little too boisterous--like the sea. A little too\nvehement--like a bull who has made up his mind to consider every\ncolour scarlet. But I grant a sledge-hammering sort of merit in him!\"\n\nI should have been surprised if those two could have thought very\nhighly of one another, Mr. Boythorn attaching so much importance to\nmany things and Mr. Skimpole caring so little for anything. Besides\nwhich, I had noticed Mr. Boythorn more than once on the point of\nbreaking out into some strong opinion when Mr. Skimpole was referred\nto. Of course I merely joined Ada in saying that we had been greatly\npleased with him.\n\n\"He has invited me,\" said Mr. Skimpole; \"and if a child may trust\nhimself in such hands--which the present child is encouraged to do,\nwith the united tenderness of two angels to guard him--I shall go. He\nproposes to frank me down and back again. I suppose it will cost\nmoney? Shillings perhaps? Or pounds? Or something of that sort? By\nthe by, Coavinses. You remember our friend Coavinses, Miss\nSummerson?\"\n\nHe asked me as the subject arose in his mind, in his graceful,\nlight-hearted manner and without the least embarrassment.\n\n\"Oh, yes!\" said I.\n\n\"Coavinses has been arrested by the Great Bailiff,\" said Mr.\nSkimpole. \"He will never do violence to the sunshine any more.\"\n\nIt quite shocked me to hear it, for I had already recalled with\nanything but a serious association the image of the man sitting on\nthe sofa that night wiping his head.\n\n\"His successor informed me of it yesterday,\" said Mr. Skimpole. \"His\nsuccessor is in my house now--in possession, I think he calls it. He\ncame yesterday, on my blue-eyed daughter's birthday. I put it to him,\n'This is unreasonable and inconvenient. If you had a blue-eyed\ndaughter you wouldn't like ME to come, uninvited, on HER birthday?'\nBut he stayed.\"\n\nMr. Skimpole laughed at the pleasant absurdity and lightly touched\nthe piano by which he was seated.\n\n\"And he told me,\" he said, playing little chords where I shall put\nfull stops, \"The Coavinses had left. Three children. No mother. And\nthat Coavinses' profession. Being unpopular. The rising Coavinses.\nWere at a considerable disadvantage.\"\n\nMr. Jarndyce got up, rubbing his head, and began to walk about. Mr.\nSkimpole played the melody of one of Ada's favourite songs. Ada and I\nboth looked at Mr. Jarndyce, thinking that we knew what was passing\nin his mind.\n\nAfter walking and stopping, and several times leaving off rubbing his\nhead, and beginning again, my guardian put his hand upon the keys and\nstopped Mr. Skimpole's playing. \"I don't like this, Skimpole,\" he\nsaid thoughtfully.\n\nMr. Skimpole, who had quite forgotten the subject, looked up\nsurprised.\n\n\"The man was necessary,\" pursued my guardian, walking backward and\nforward in the very short space between the piano and the end of the\nroom and rubbing his hair up from the back of his head as if a high\neast wind had blown it into that form. \"If we make such men necessary\nby our faults and follies, or by our want of worldly knowledge, or by\nour misfortunes, we must not revenge ourselves upon them. There was\nno harm in his trade. He maintained his children. One would like to\nknow more about this.\"\n\n\"Oh! Coavinses?\" cried Mr. Skimpole, at length perceiving what he\nmeant. \"Nothing easier. A walk to Coavinses' headquarters, and you\ncan know what you will.\"\n\nMr. Jarndyce nodded to us, who were only waiting for the signal.\n\"Come! We will walk that way, my dears. Why not that way as soon as\nanother!\" We were quickly ready and went out. Mr. Skimpole went with\nus and quite enjoyed the expedition. It was so new and so refreshing,\nhe said, for him to want Coavinses instead of Coavinses wanting him!\n\nHe took us, first, to Cursitor Street, Chancery Lane, where there was\na house with barred windows, which he called Coavinses' Castle. On\nour going into the entry and ringing a bell, a very hideous boy came\nout of a sort of office and looked at us over a spiked wicket.\n\n\"Who did you want?\" said the boy, fitting two of the spikes into his\nchin.\n\n\"There was a follower, or an officer, or something, here,\" said Mr.\nJarndyce, \"who is dead.\"\n\n\"Yes?\" said the boy. \"Well?\"\n\n\"I want to know his name, if you please?\"\n\n\"Name of Neckett,\" said the boy.\n\n\"And his address?\"\n\n\"Bell Yard,\" said the boy. \"Chandler's shop, left hand side, name of\nBlinder.\"\n\n\"Was he--I don't know how to shape the question--\" murmured my\nguardian, \"industrious?\"\n\n\"Was Neckett?\" said the boy. \"Yes, wery much so. He was never tired\nof watching. He'd set upon a post at a street corner eight or ten\nhours at a stretch if he undertook to do it.\"\n\n\"He might have done worse,\" I heard my guardian soliloquize. \"He\nmight have undertaken to do it and not done it. Thank you. That's all\nI want.\"\n\nWe left the boy, with his head on one side and his arms on the gate,\nfondling and sucking the spikes, and went back to Lincoln's Inn,\nwhere Mr. Skimpole, who had not cared to remain nearer Coavinses,\nawaited us. Then we all went to Bell Yard, a narrow alley at a very\nshort distance. We soon found the chandler's shop. In it was a\ngood-natured-looking old woman with a dropsy, or an asthma, or\nperhaps both.\n\n\"Neckett's children?\" said she in reply to my inquiry. \"Yes, Surely,\nmiss. Three pair, if you please. Door right opposite the stairs.\" And\nshe handed me the key across the counter.\n\nI glanced at the key and glanced at her, but she took it for granted\nthat I knew what to do with it. As it could only be intended for the\nchildren's door, I came out without asking any more questions and led\nthe way up the dark stairs. We went as quietly as we could, but four\nof us made some noise on the aged boards, and when we came to the\nsecond story we found we had disturbed a man who was standing there\nlooking out of his room.\n\n\"Is it Gridley that's wanted?\" he said, fixing his eyes on me with an\nangry stare.\n\n\"No, sir,\" said I; \"I am going higher up.\"\n\nHe looked at Ada, and at Mr. Jarndyce, and at Mr. Skimpole, fixing\nthe same angry stare on each in succession as they passed and\nfollowed me. Mr. Jarndyce gave him good day. \"Good day!\" he said\nabruptly and fiercely. He was a tall, sallow man with a careworn head\non which but little hair remained, a deeply lined face, and prominent\neyes. He had a combative look and a chafing, irritable manner which,\nassociated with his figure--still large and powerful, though\nevidently in its decline--rather alarmed me. He had a pen in his\nhand, and in the glimpse I caught of his room in passing, I saw that\nit was covered with a litter of papers.\n\nLeaving him standing there, we went up to the top room. I tapped at\nthe door, and a little shrill voice inside said, \"We are locked in.\nMrs. Blinder's got the key!\"\n\nI applied the key on hearing this and opened the door. In a poor room\nwith a sloping ceiling and containing very little furniture was a\nmite of a boy, some five or six years old, nursing and hushing a\nheavy child of eighteen months. There was no fire, though the weather\nwas cold; both children were wrapped in some poor shawls and tippets\nas a substitute. Their clothing was not so warm, however, but that\ntheir noses looked red and pinched and their small figures shrunken\nas the boy walked up and down nursing and hushing the child with its\nhead on his shoulder.\n\n\"Who has locked you up here alone?\" we naturally asked.\n\n\"Charley,\" said the boy, standing still to gaze at us.\n\n\"Is Charley your brother?\"\n\n\"No. She's my sister, Charlotte. Father called her Charley.\"\n\n\"Are there any more of you besides Charley?\"\n\n\"Me,\" said the boy, \"and Emma,\" patting the limp bonnet of the child\nhe was nursing. \"And Charley.\"\n\n\"Where is Charley now?\"\n\n\"Out a-washing,\" said the boy, beginning to walk up and down again\nand taking the nankeen bonnet much too near the bedstead by trying to\ngaze at us at the same time.\n\nWe were looking at one another and at these two children when there\ncame into the room a very little girl, childish in figure but shrewd\nand older-looking in the face--pretty-faced too--wearing a womanly\nsort of bonnet much too large for her and drying her bare arms on a\nwomanly sort of apron. Her fingers were white and wrinkled with\nwashing, and the soap-suds were yet smoking which she wiped off her\narms. But for this, she might have been a child playing at washing\nand imitating a poor working-woman with a quick observation of the\ntruth.\n\nShe had come running from some place in the neighbourhood and had\nmade all the haste she could. Consequently, though she was very\nlight, she was out of breath and could not speak at first, as she\nstood panting, and wiping her arms, and looking quietly at us.\n\n\"Oh, here's Charley!\" said the boy.\n\nThe child he was nursing stretched forth its arms and cried out to be\ntaken by Charley. The little girl took it, in a womanly sort of\nmanner belonging to the apron and the bonnet, and stood looking at us\nover the burden that clung to her most affectionately.\n\n\"Is it possible,\" whispered my guardian as we put a chair for the\nlittle creature and got her to sit down with her load, the boy\nkeeping close to her, holding to her apron, \"that this child works\nfor the rest? Look at this! For God's sake, look at this!\"\n\nIt was a thing to look at. The three children close together, and two\nof them relying solely on the third, and the third so young and yet\nwith an air of age and steadiness that sat so strangely on the\nchildish figure.\n\n\"Charley, Charley!\" said my guardian. \"How old are you?\"\n\n\"Over thirteen, sir,\" replied the child.\n\n\"Oh! What a great age,\" said my guardian. \"What a great age,\nCharley!\"\n\nI cannot describe the tenderness with which he spoke to her, half\nplayfully yet all the more compassionately and mournfully.\n\n\"And do you live alone here with these babies, Charley?\" said my\nguardian.\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" returned the child, looking up into his face with perfect\nconfidence, \"since father died.\"\n\n\"And how do you live, Charley? Oh! Charley,\" said my guardian,\nturning his face away for a moment, \"how do you live?\"\n\n\"Since father died, sir, I've gone out to work. I'm out washing\nto-day.\"\n\n\"God help you, Charley!\" said my guardian. \"You're not tall enough to\nreach the tub!\"\n\n\"In pattens I am, sir,\" she said quickly. \"I've got a high pair as\nbelonged to mother.\"\n\n\"And when did mother die? Poor mother!\"\n\n\"Mother died just after Emma was born,\" said the child, glancing at\nthe face upon her bosom. \"Then father said I was to be as good a\nmother to her as I could. And so I tried. And so I worked at home and\ndid cleaning and nursing and washing for a long time before I began\nto go out. And that's how I know how; don't you see, sir?\"\n\n\"And do you often go out?\"\n\n\"As often as I can,\" said Charley, opening her eyes and smiling,\n\"because of earning sixpences and shillings!\"\n\n\"And do you always lock the babies up when you go out?\"\n\n\"To keep 'em safe, sir, don't you see?\" said Charley. \"Mrs. Blinder\ncomes up now and then, and Mr. Gridley comes up sometimes, and\nperhaps I can run in sometimes, and they can play you know, and Tom\nan't afraid of being locked up, are you, Tom?\"\n\n\"No-o!\" said Tom stoutly.\n\n\"When it comes on dark, the lamps are lighted down in the court, and\nthey show up here quite bright--almost quite bright. Don't they,\nTom?\"\n\n\"Yes, Charley,\" said Tom, \"almost quite bright.\"\n\n\"Then he's as good as gold,\" said the little creature--Oh, in such a\nmotherly, womanly way! \"And when Emma's tired, he puts her to bed.\nAnd when he's tired he goes to bed himself. And when I come home and\nlight the candle and has a bit of supper, he sits up again and has it\nwith me. Don't you, Tom?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, Charley!\" said Tom. \"That I do!\" And either in this glimpse\nof the great pleasure of his life or in gratitude and love for\nCharley, who was all in all to him, he laid his face among the scanty\nfolds of her frock and passed from laughing into crying.\n\nIt was the first time since our entry that a tear had been shed among\nthese children. The little orphan girl had spoken of their father and\ntheir mother as if all that sorrow were subdued by the necessity of\ntaking courage, and by her childish importance in being able to work,\nand by her bustling busy way. But now, when Tom cried, although she\nsat quite tranquil, looking quietly at us, and did not by any\nmovement disturb a hair of the head of either of her little charges,\nI saw two silent tears fall down her face.\n\nI stood at the window with Ada, pretending to look at the housetops,\nand the blackened stack of chimneys, and the poor plants, and the\nbirds in little cages belonging to the neighbours, when I found that\nMrs. Blinder, from the shop below, had come in (perhaps it had taken\nher all this time to get upstairs) and was talking to my guardian.\n\n\"It's not much to forgive 'em the rent, sir,\" she said; \"who could\ntake it from them!\"\n\n\"Well, well!\" said my guardian to us two. \"It is enough that the time\nwill come when this good woman will find that it WAS much, and that\nforasmuch as she did it unto the least of these--This child,\" he\nadded after a few moments, \"could she possibly continue this?\"\n\n\"Really, sir, I think she might,\" said Mrs. Blinder, getting her\nheavy breath by painful degrees. \"She's as handy as it's possible to\nbe. Bless you, sir, the way she tended them two children after the\nmother died was the talk of the yard! And it was a wonder to see her\nwith him after he was took ill, it really was! 'Mrs. Blinder,' he\nsaid to me the very last he spoke--he was lying there--'Mrs.\nBlinder, whatever my calling may have been, I see a angel sitting in\nthis room last night along with my child, and I trust her to Our\nFather!'\"\n\n\"He had no other calling?\" said my guardian.\n\n\"No, sir,\" returned Mrs. Blinder, \"he was nothing but a follerers.\nWhen he first came to lodge here, I didn't know what he was, and I\nconfess that when I found out I gave him notice. It wasn't liked in\nthe yard. It wasn't approved by the other lodgers. It is NOT a\ngenteel calling,\" said Mrs. Blinder, \"and most people do object to\nit. Mr. Gridley objected to it very strong, and he is a good lodger,\nthough his temper has been hard tried.\"\n\n\"So you gave him notice?\" said my guardian.\n\n\"So I gave him notice,\" said Mrs. Blinder. \"But really when the time\ncame, and I knew no other ill of him, I was in doubts. He was\npunctual and diligent; he did what he had to do, sir,\" said Mrs.\nBlinder, unconsciously fixing Mr. Skimpole with her eye, \"and it's\nsomething in this world even to do that.\"\n\n\"So you kept him after all?\"\n\n\"Why, I said that if he could arrange with Mr. Gridley, I could\narrange it with the other lodgers and should not so much mind its\nbeing liked or disliked in the yard. Mr. Gridley gave his consent\ngruff--but gave it. He was always gruff with him, but he has been\nkind to the children since. A person is never known till a person is\nproved.\"\n\n\"Have many people been kind to the children?\" asked Mr. Jarndyce.\n\n\"Upon the whole, not so bad, sir,\" said Mrs. Blinder; \"but certainly\nnot so many as would have been if their father's calling had been\ndifferent. Mr. Coavins gave a guinea, and the follerers made up a\nlittle purse. Some neighbours in the yard that had always joked and\ntapped their shoulders when he went by came forward with a little\nsubscription, and--in general--not so bad. Similarly with Charlotte.\nSome people won't employ her because she was a follerer's child; some\npeople that do employ her cast it at her; some make a merit of having\nher to work for them, with that and all her draw-backs upon her, and\nperhaps pay her less and put upon her more. But she's patienter than\nothers would be, and is clever too, and always willing, up to the\nfull mark of her strength and over. So I should say, in general, not\nso bad, sir, but might be better.\"\n\nMrs. Blinder sat down to give herself a more favourable opportunity\nof recovering her breath, exhausted anew by so much talking before it\nwas fully restored. Mr. Jarndyce was turning to speak to us when his\nattention was attracted by the abrupt entrance into the room of the\nMr. Gridley who had been mentioned and whom we had seen on our way\nup.\n\n\"I don't know what you may be doing here, ladies and gentlemen,\" he\nsaid, as if he resented our presence, \"but you'll excuse my coming\nin. I don't come in to stare about me. Well, Charley! Well, Tom!\nWell, little one! How is it with us all to-day?\"\n\nHe bent over the group in a caressing way and clearly was regarded as\na friend by the children, though his face retained its stern\ncharacter and his manner to us was as rude as it could be. My\nguardian noticed it and respected it.\n\n\"No one, surely, would come here to stare about him,\" he said mildly.\n\n\"May be so, sir, may be so,\" returned the other, taking Tom upon his\nknee and waving him off impatiently. \"I don't want to argue with\nladies and gentlemen. I have had enough of arguing to last one man\nhis life.\"\n\n\"You have sufficient reason, I dare say,\" said Mr. Jarndyce, \"for\nbeing chafed and irritated--\"\n\n\"There again!\" exclaimed the man, becoming violently angry. \"I am of\na quarrelsome temper. I am irascible. I am not polite!\"\n\n\"Not very, I think.\"\n\n\"Sir,\" said Gridley, putting down the child and going up to him as if\nhe meant to strike him, \"do you know anything of Courts of Equity?\"\n\n\"Perhaps I do, to my sorrow.\"\n\n\"To your sorrow?\" said the man, pausing in his wrath, \"if so, I beg\nyour pardon. I am not polite, I know. I beg your pardon! Sir,\" with\nrenewed violence, \"I have been dragged for five and twenty years over\nburning iron, and I have lost the habit of treading upon velvet. Go\ninto the Court of Chancery yonder and ask what is one of the standing\njokes that brighten up their business sometimes, and they will tell\nyou that the best joke they have is the man from Shropshire. I,\" he\nsaid, beating one hand on the other passionately, \"am the man from\nShropshire.\"\n\n\"I believe I and my family have also had the honour of furnishing\nsome entertainment in the same grave place,\" said my guardian\ncomposedly. \"You may have heard my name--Jarndyce.\"\n\n\"Mr. Jarndyce,\" said Gridley with a rough sort of salutation, \"you\nbear your wrongs more quietly than I can bear mine. More than that, I\ntell you--and I tell this gentleman, and these young ladies, if they\nare friends of yours--that if I took my wrongs in any other way, I\nshould be driven mad! It is only by resenting them, and by revenging\nthem in my mind, and by angrily demanding the justice I never get,\nthat I am able to keep my wits together. It is only that!\" he said,\nspeaking in a homely, rustic way and with great vehemence. \"You may\ntell me that I over-excite myself. I answer that it's in my nature to\ndo it, under wrong, and I must do it. There's nothing between doing\nit, and sinking into the smiling state of the poor little mad woman\nthat haunts the court. If I was once to sit down under it, I should\nbecome imbecile.\"\n\nThe passion and heat in which he was, and the manner in which his\nface worked, and the violent gestures with which he accompanied what\nhe said, were most painful to see.\n\n\"Mr. Jarndyce,\" he said, \"consider my case. As true as there is a\nheaven above us, this is my case. I am one of two brothers. My father\n(a farmer) made a will and left his farm and stock and so forth to my\nmother for her life. After my mother's death, all was to come to me\nexcept a legacy of three hundred pounds that I was then to pay my\nbrother. My mother died. My brother some time afterwards claimed his\nlegacy. I and some of my relations said that he had had a part of it\nalready in board and lodging and some other things. Now mind! That\nwas the question, and nothing else. No one disputed the will; no one\ndisputed anything but whether part of that three hundred pounds had\nbeen already paid or not. To settle that question, my brother filing\na bill, I was obliged to go into this accursed Chancery; I was forced\nthere because the law forced me and would let me go nowhere else.\nSeventeen people were made defendants to that simple suit! It first\ncame on after two years. It was then stopped for another two years\nwhile the master (may his head rot off!) inquired whether I was my\nfather's son, about which there was no dispute at all with any mortal\ncreature. He then found out that there were not defendants\nenough--remember, there were only seventeen as yet!--but that we must\nhave another who had been left out and must begin all over again. The\ncosts at that time--before the thing was begun!--were three times the\nlegacy. My brother would have given up the legacy, and joyful, to\nescape more costs. My whole estate, left to me in that will of my\nfather's, has gone in costs. The suit, still undecided, has fallen\ninto rack, and ruin, and despair, with everything else--and here I\nstand, this day! Now, Mr. Jarndyce, in your suit there are thousands\nand thousands involved, where in mine there are hundreds. Is mine\nless hard to bear or is it harder to bear, when my whole living was\nin it and has been thus shamefully sucked away?\"\n\nMr. Jarndyce said that he condoled with him with all his heart and\nthat he set up no monopoly himself in being unjustly treated by this\nmonstrous system.\n\n\"There again!\" said Mr. Gridley with no diminution of his rage. \"The\nsystem! I am told on all hands, it's the system. I mustn't look to\nindividuals. It's the system. I mustn't go into court and say, 'My\nLord, I beg to know this from you--is this right or wrong? Have you\nthe face to tell me I have received justice and therefore am\ndismissed?' My Lord knows nothing of it. He sits there to administer\nthe system. I mustn't go to Mr. Tulkinghorn, the solicitor in\nLincoln's Inn Fields, and say to him when he makes me furious by\nbeing so cool and satisfied--as they all do, for I know they gain by\nit while I lose, don't I?--I mustn't say to him, 'I will have\nsomething out of some one for my ruin, by fair means or foul!' HE is\nnot responsible. It's the system. But, if I do no violence to any of\nthem, here--I may! I don't know what may happen if I am carried\nbeyond myself at last! I will accuse the individual workers of that\nsystem against me, face to face, before the great eternal bar!\"\n\nHis passion was fearful. I could not have believed in such rage\nwithout seeing it.\n\n\"I have done!\" he said, sitting down and wiping his face. \"Mr.\nJarndyce, I have done! I am violent, I know. I ought to know it. I\nhave been in prison for contempt of court. I have been in prison for\nthreatening the solicitor. I have been in this trouble, and that\ntrouble, and shall be again. I am the man from Shropshire, and I\nsometimes go beyond amusing them, though they have found it amusing,\ntoo, to see me committed into custody and brought up in custody and\nall that. It would be better for me, they tell me, if I restrained\nmyself. I tell them that if I did restrain myself I should become\nimbecile. I was a good-enough-tempered man once, I believe. People in\nmy part of the country say they remember me so, but now I must have\nthis vent under my sense of injury or nothing could hold my wits\ntogether. It would be far better for you, Mr. Gridley,' the Lord\nChancellor told me last week, 'not to waste your time here, and to\nstay, usefully employed, down in Shropshire.' 'My Lord, my Lord, I\nknow it would,' said I to him, 'and it would have been far better for\nme never to have heard the name of your high office, but unhappily\nfor me, I can't undo the past, and the past drives me here!'\nBesides,\" he added, breaking fiercely out, \"I'll shame them. To the\nlast, I'll show myself in that court to its shame. If I knew when I\nwas going to die, and could be carried there, and had a voice to\nspeak with, I would die there, saying, 'You have brought me here and\nsent me from here many and many a time. Now send me out feet\nforemost!'\"\n\nHis countenance had, perhaps for years, become so set in its\ncontentious expression that it did not soften, even now when he was\nquiet.\n\n\"I came to take these babies down to my room for an hour,\" he said,\ngoing to them again, \"and let them play about. I didn't mean to say\nall this, but it don't much signify. You're not afraid of me, Tom,\nare you?\"\n\n\"No!\" said Tom. \"You ain't angry with ME.\"\n\n\"You are right, my child. You're going back, Charley? Aye? Come then,\nlittle one!\" He took the youngest child on his arm, where she was\nwilling enough to be carried. \"I shouldn't wonder if we found a\nginger-bread soldier downstairs. Let's go and look for him!\"\n\nHe made his former rough salutation, which was not deficient in a\ncertain respect, to Mr. Jarndyce, and bowing slightly to us, went\ndownstairs to his room.\n\nUpon that, Mr. Skimpole began to talk, for the first time since our\narrival, in his usual gay strain. He said, Well, it was really very\npleasant to see how things lazily adapted themselves to purposes.\nHere was this Mr. Gridley, a man of a robust will and surprising\nenergy--intellectually speaking, a sort of inharmonious\nblacksmith--and he could easily imagine that there Gridley was, years\nago, wandering about in life for something to expend his superfluous\ncombativeness upon--a sort of Young Love among the thorns--when the\nCourt of Chancery came in his way and accommodated him with the exact\nthing he wanted. There they were, matched, ever afterwards! Otherwise\nhe might have been a great general, blowing up all sorts of towns, or\nhe might have been a great politician, dealing in all sorts of\nparliamentary rhetoric; but as it was, he and the Court of Chancery\nhad fallen upon each other in the pleasantest way, and nobody was\nmuch the worse, and Gridley was, so to speak, from that hour provided\nfor. Then look at Coavinses! How delightfully poor Coavinses (father\nof these charming children) illustrated the same principle! He, Mr.\nSkimpole, himself, had sometimes repined at the existence of\nCoavinses. He had found Coavinses in his way. He could had dispensed\nwith Coavinses. There had been times when, if he had been a sultan,\nand his grand vizier had said one morning, \"What does the Commander\nof the Faithful require at the hands of his slave?\" he might have\neven gone so far as to reply, \"The head of Coavinses!\" But what\nturned out to be the case? That, all that time, he had been giving\nemployment to a most deserving man, that he had been a benefactor to\nCoavinses, that he had actually been enabling Coavinses to bring up\nthese charming children in this agreeable way, developing these\nsocial virtues! Insomuch that his heart had just now swelled and the\ntears had come into his eyes when he had looked round the room and\nthought, \"I was the great patron of Coavinses, and his little\ncomforts were MY work!\"\n\nThere was something so captivating in his light way of touching these\nfantastic strings, and he was such a mirthful child by the side of\nthe graver childhood we had seen, that he made my guardian smile even\nas he turned towards us from a little private talk with Mrs. Blinder.\nWe kissed Charley, and took her downstairs with us, and stopped\noutside the house to see her run away to her work. I don't know where\nshe was going, but we saw her run, such a little, little creature in\nher womanly bonnet and apron, through a covered way at the bottom of\nthe court and melt into the city's strife and sound like a dewdrop in\nan ocean.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI\n\nTom-all-Alone's\n\n\nMy Lady Dedlock is restless, very restless. The astonished\nfashionable intelligence hardly knows where to have her. To-day she\nis at Chesney Wold; yesterday she was at her house in town; to-morrow\nshe may be abroad, for anything the fashionable intelligence can with\nconfidence predict. Even Sir Leicester's gallantry has some trouble\nto keep pace with her. It would have more but that his other faithful\nally, for better and for worse--the gout--darts into the old oak\nbed-chamber at Chesney Wold and grips him by both legs.\n\nSir Leicester receives the gout as a troublesome demon, but still a\ndemon of the patrician order. All the Dedlocks, in the direct male\nline, through a course of time during and beyond which the memory of\nman goeth not to the contrary, have had the gout. It can be proved,\nsir. Other men's fathers may have died of the rheumatism or may have\ntaken base contagion from the tainted blood of the sick vulgar, but\nthe Dedlock family have communicated something exclusive even to the\nlevelling process of dying by dying of their own family gout. It has\ncome down through the illustrious line like the plate, or the\npictures, or the place in Lincolnshire. It is among their dignities.\nSir Leicester is perhaps not wholly without an impression, though he\nhas never resolved it into words, that the angel of death in the\ndischarge of his necessary duties may observe to the shades of the\naristocracy, \"My lords and gentlemen, I have the honour to present to\nyou another Dedlock certified to have arrived per the family gout.\"\n\nHence Sir Leicester yields up his family legs to the family disorder\nas if he held his name and fortune on that feudal tenure. He feels\nthat for a Dedlock to be laid upon his back and spasmodically\ntwitched and stabbed in his extremities is a liberty taken somewhere,\nbut he thinks, \"We have all yielded to this; it belongs to us; it has\nfor some hundreds of years been understood that we are not to make\nthe vaults in the park interesting on more ignoble terms; and I\nsubmit myself to the compromise.\"\n\nAnd a goodly show he makes, lying in a flush of crimson and gold in\nthe midst of the great drawing-room before his favourite picture of\nmy Lady, with broad strips of sunlight shining in, down the long\nperspective, through the long line of windows, and alternating with\nsoft reliefs of shadow. Outside, the stately oaks, rooted for ages in\nthe green ground which has never known ploughshare, but was still a\nchase when kings rode to battle with sword and shield and rode\na-hunting with bow and arrow, bear witness to his greatness. Inside,\nhis forefathers, looking on him from the walls, say, \"Each of us was\na passing reality here and left this coloured shadow of himself and\nmelted into remembrance as dreamy as the distant voices of the rooks\nnow lulling you to rest,\" and hear their testimony to his greatness\ntoo. And he is very great this day. And woe to Boythorn or other\ndaring wight who shall presumptuously contest an inch with him!\n\nMy Lady is at present represented, near Sir Leicester, by her\nportrait. She has flitted away to town, with no intention of\nremaining there, and will soon flit hither again, to the confusion of\nthe fashionable intelligence. The house in town is not prepared for\nher reception. It is muffled and dreary. Only one Mercury in powder\ngapes disconsolate at the hall-window; and he mentioned last night to\nanother Mercury of his acquaintance, also accustomed to good society,\nthat if that sort of thing was to last--which it couldn't, for a man\nof his spirits couldn't bear it, and a man of his figure couldn't be\nexpected to bear it--there would be no resource for him, upon his\nhonour, but to cut his throat!\n\nWhat connexion can there be between the place in Lincolnshire, the\nhouse in town, the Mercury in powder, and the whereabout of Jo the\noutlaw with the broom, who had that distant ray of light upon him\nwhen he swept the churchyard-step? What connexion can there have been\nbetween many people in the innumerable histories of this world who\nfrom opposite sides of great gulfs have, nevertheless, been very\ncuriously brought together!\n\nJo sweeps his crossing all day long, unconscious of the link, if any\nlink there be. He sums up his mental condition when asked a question\nby replying that he \"don't know nothink.\" He knows that it's hard to\nkeep the mud off the crossing in dirty weather, and harder still to\nlive by doing it. Nobody taught him even that much; he found it out.\n\nJo lives--that is to say, Jo has not yet died--in a ruinous place\nknown to the like of him by the name of Tom-all-Alone's. It is a\nblack, dilapidated street, avoided by all decent people, where the\ncrazy houses were seized upon, when their decay was far advanced, by\nsome bold vagrants who after establishing their own possession took\nto letting them out in lodgings. Now, these tumbling tenements\ncontain, by night, a swarm of misery. As on the ruined human wretch\nvermin parasites appear, so these ruined shelters have bred a crowd\nof foul existence that crawls in and out of gaps in walls and boards;\nand coils itself to sleep, in maggot numbers, where the rain drips\nin; and comes and goes, fetching and carrying fever and sowing more\nevil in its every footprint than Lord Coodle, and Sir Thomas Doodle,\nand the Duke of Foodle, and all the fine gentlemen in office, down to\nZoodle, shall set right in five hundred years--though born expressly\nto do it.\n\nTwice lately there has been a crash and a cloud of dust, like the\nspringing of a mine, in Tom-all-Alone's; and each time a house has\nfallen. These accidents have made a paragraph in the newspapers and\nhave filled a bed or two in the nearest hospital. The gaps remain,\nand there are not unpopular lodgings among the rubbish. As several\nmore houses are nearly ready to go, the next crash in Tom-all-Alone's\nmay be expected to be a good one.\n\nThis desirable property is in Chancery, of course. It would be an\ninsult to the discernment of any man with half an eye to tell him so.\nWhether \"Tom\" is the popular representative of the original plaintiff\nor defendant in Jarndyce and Jarndyce, or whether Tom lived here when\nthe suit had laid the street waste, all alone, until other settlers\ncame to join him, or whether the traditional title is a comprehensive\nname for a retreat cut off from honest company and put out of the\npale of hope, perhaps nobody knows. Certainly Jo don't know.\n\n\"For I don't,\" says Jo, \"I don't know nothink.\"\n\nIt must be a strange state to be like Jo! To shuffle through the\nstreets, unfamiliar with the shapes, and in utter darkness as to the\nmeaning, of those mysterious symbols, so abundant over the shops, and\nat the corners of streets, and on the doors, and in the windows! To\nsee people read, and to see people write, and to see the postmen\ndeliver letters, and not to have the least idea of all that\nlanguage--to be, to every scrap of it, stone blind and dumb! It must\nbe very puzzling to see the good company going to the churches on\nSundays, with their books in their hands, and to think (for perhaps\nJo DOES think at odd times) what does it all mean, and if it means\nanything to anybody, how comes it that it means nothing to me? To be\nhustled, and jostled, and moved on; and really to feel that it would\nappear to be perfectly true that I have no business here, or there,\nor anywhere; and yet to be perplexed by the consideration that I AM\nhere somehow, too, and everybody overlooked me until I became the\ncreature that I am! It must be a strange state, not merely to be told\nthat I am scarcely human (as in the case of my offering myself for a\nwitness), but to feel it of my own knowledge all my life! To see the\nhorses, dogs, and cattle go by me and to know that in ignorance I\nbelong to them and not to the superior beings in my shape, whose\ndelicacy I offend! Jo's ideas of a criminal trial, or a judge, or a\nbishop, or a government, or that inestimable jewel to him (if he only\nknew it) the Constitution, should be strange! His whole material and\nimmaterial life is wonderfully strange; his death, the strangest\nthing of all.\n\nJo comes out of Tom-all-Alone's, meeting the tardy morning which is\nalways late in getting down there, and munches his dirty bit of bread\nas he comes along. His way lying through many streets, and the houses\nnot yet being open, he sits down to breakfast on the door-step of the\nSociety for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts and gives\nit a brush when he has finished as an acknowledgment of the\naccommodation. He admires the size of the edifice and wonders what\nit's all about. He has no idea, poor wretch, of the spiritual\ndestitution of a coral reef in the Pacific or what it costs to look\nup the precious souls among the coco-nuts and bread-fruit.\n\nHe goes to his crossing and begins to lay it out for the day. The\ntown awakes; the great tee-totum is set up for its daily spin and\nwhirl; all that unaccountable reading and writing, which has been\nsuspended for a few hours, recommences. Jo and the other lower\nanimals get on in the unintelligible mess as they can. It is\nmarket-day. The blinded oxen, over-goaded, over-driven, never guided,\nrun into wrong places and are beaten out, and plunge red-eyed and\nfoaming at stone walls, and often sorely hurt the innocent, and often\nsorely hurt themselves. Very like Jo and his order; very, very like!\n\nA band of music comes and plays. Jo listens to it. So does a dog--a\ndrover's dog, waiting for his master outside a butcher's shop, and\nevidently thinking about those sheep he has had upon his mind for\nsome hours and is happily rid of. He seems perplexed respecting three\nor four, can't remember where he left them, looks up and down the\nstreet as half expecting to see them astray, suddenly pricks up his\nears and remembers all about it. A thoroughly vagabond dog,\naccustomed to low company and public-houses; a terrific dog to sheep,\nready at a whistle to scamper over their backs and tear out mouthfuls\nof their wool; but an educated, improved, developed dog who has been\ntaught his duties and knows how to discharge them. He and Jo listen\nto the music, probably with much the same amount of animal\nsatisfaction; likewise as to awakened association, aspiration, or\nregret, melancholy or joyful reference to things beyond the senses,\nthey are probably upon a par. But, otherwise, how far above the human\nlistener is the brute!\n\nTurn that dog's descendants wild, like Jo, and in a very few years\nthey will so degenerate that they will lose even their bark--but not\ntheir bite.\n\nThe day changes as it wears itself away and becomes dark and drizzly.\nJo fights it out at his crossing among the mud and wheels, the\nhorses, whips, and umbrellas, and gets but a scanty sum to pay for\nthe unsavoury shelter of Tom-all-Alone's. Twilight comes on; gas\nbegins to start up in the shops; the lamplighter, with his ladder,\nruns along the margin of the pavement. A wretched evening is\nbeginning to close in.\n\nIn his chambers Mr. Tulkinghorn sits meditating an application to the\nnearest magistrate to-morrow morning for a warrant. Gridley, a\ndisappointed suitor, has been here to-day and has been alarming. We\nare not to be put in bodily fear, and that ill-conditioned fellow\nshall be held to bail again. From the ceiling, foreshortened\nAllegory, in the person of one impossible Roman upside down, points\nwith the arm of Samson (out of joint, and an odd one) obtrusively\ntoward the window. Why should Mr. Tulkinghorn, for such no reason,\nlook out of window? Is the hand not always pointing there? So he does\nnot look out of window.\n\nAnd if he did, what would it be to see a woman going by? There are\nwomen enough in the world, Mr. Tulkinghorn thinks--too many; they are\nat the bottom of all that goes wrong in it, though, for the matter of\nthat, they create business for lawyers. What would it be to see a\nwoman going by, even though she were going secretly? They are all\nsecret. Mr. Tulkinghorn knows that very well.\n\nBut they are not all like the woman who now leaves him and his house\nbehind, between whose plain dress and her refined manner there is\nsomething exceedingly inconsistent. She should be an upper servant by\nher attire, yet in her air and step, though both are hurried and\nassumed--as far as she can assume in the muddy streets, which she\ntreads with an unaccustomed foot--she is a lady. Her face is veiled,\nand still she sufficiently betrays herself to make more than one of\nthose who pass her look round sharply.\n\nShe never turns her head. Lady or servant, she has a purpose in her\nand can follow it. She never turns her head until she comes to the\ncrossing where Jo plies with his broom. He crosses with her and begs.\nStill, she does not turn her head until she has landed on the other\nside. Then she slightly beckons to him and says, \"Come here!\"\n\nJo follows her a pace or two into a quiet court.\n\n\"Are you the boy I've read of in the papers?\" she asked behind her\nveil.\n\n\"I don't know,\" says Jo, staring moodily at the veil, \"nothink about\nno papers. I don't know nothink about nothink at all.\"\n\n\"Were you examined at an inquest?\"\n\n\"I don't know nothink about no--where I was took by the beadle, do\nyou mean?\" says Jo. \"Was the boy's name at the inkwhich Jo?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"That's me!\" says Jo.\n\n\"Come farther up.\"\n\n\"You mean about the man?\" says Jo, following. \"Him as wos dead?\"\n\n\"Hush! Speak in a whisper! Yes. Did he look, when he was living, so\nvery ill and poor?\"\n\n\"Oh, jist!\" says Jo.\n\n\"Did he look like--not like YOU?\" says the woman with abhorrence.\n\n\"Oh, not so bad as me,\" says Jo. \"I'm a reg'lar one I am! You didn't\nknow him, did you?\"\n\n\"How dare you ask me if I knew him?\"\n\n\"No offence, my lady,\" says Jo with much humility, for even he has\ngot at the suspicion of her being a lady.\n\n\"I am not a lady. I am a servant.\"\n\n\"You are a jolly servant!\" says Jo without the least idea of saying\nanything offensive, merely as a tribute of admiration.\n\n\"Listen and be silent. Don't talk to me, and stand farther from me!\nCan you show me all those places that were spoken of in the account I\nread? The place he wrote for, the place he died at, the place where\nyou were taken to, and the place where he was buried? Do you know the\nplace where he was buried?\"\n\nJo answers with a nod, having also nodded as each other place was\nmentioned.\n\n\"Go before me and show me all those dreadful places. Stop opposite to\neach, and don't speak to me unless I speak to you. Don't look back.\nDo what I want, and I will pay you well.\"\n\nJo attends closely while the words are being spoken; tells them off\non his broom-handle, finding them rather hard; pauses to consider\ntheir meaning; considers it satisfactory; and nods his ragged head.\n\n\"I'm fly,\" says Jo. \"But fen larks, you know. Stow hooking it!\"\n\n\"What does the horrible creature mean?\" exclaims the servant,\nrecoiling from him.\n\n\"Stow cutting away, you know!\" says Jo.\n\n\"I don't understand you. Go on before! I will give you more money\nthan you ever had in your life.\"\n\nJo screws up his mouth into a whistle, gives his ragged head a rub,\ntakes his broom under his arm, and leads the way, passing deftly with\nhis bare feet over the hard stones and through the mud and mire.\n\nCook's Court. Jo stops. A pause.\n\n\"Who lives here?\"\n\n\"Him wot give him his writing and give me half a bull,\" says Jo in a\nwhisper without looking over his shoulder.\n\n\"Go on to the next.\"\n\nKrook's house. Jo stops again. A longer pause.\n\n\"Who lives here?\"\n\n\"HE lived here,\" Jo answers as before.\n\nAfter a silence he is asked, \"In which room?\"\n\n\"In the back room up there. You can see the winder from this corner.\nUp there! That's where I see him stritched out. This is the\npublic-ouse where I was took to.\"\n\n\"Go on to the next!\"\n\nIt is a longer walk to the next, but Jo, relieved of his first\nsuspicions, sticks to the forms imposed upon him and does not look\nround. By many devious ways, reeking with offence of many kinds, they\ncome to the little tunnel of a court, and to the gas-lamp (lighted\nnow), and to the iron gate.\n\n\"He was put there,\" says Jo, holding to the bars and looking in.\n\n\"Where? Oh, what a scene of horror!\"\n\n\"There!\" says Jo, pointing. \"Over yinder. Among them piles of bones,\nand close to that there kitchin winder! They put him wery nigh the\ntop. They was obliged to stamp upon it to git it in. I could unkiver\nit for you with my broom if the gate was open. That's why they locks\nit, I s'pose,\" giving it a shake. \"It's always locked. Look at the\nrat!\" cries Jo, excited. \"Hi! Look! There he goes! Ho! Into the\nground!\"\n\nThe servant shrinks into a corner, into a corner of that hideous\narchway, with its deadly stains contaminating her dress; and putting\nout her two hands and passionately telling him to keep away from her,\nfor he is loathsome to her, so remains for some moments. Jo stands\nstaring and is still staring when she recovers herself.\n\n\"Is this place of abomination consecrated ground?\"\n\n\"I don't know nothink of consequential ground,\" says Jo, still\nstaring.\n\n\"Is it blessed?\"\n\n\"Which?\" says Jo, in the last degree amazed.\n\n\"Is it blessed?\"\n\n\"I'm blest if I know,\" says Jo, staring more than ever; \"but I\nshouldn't think it warn't. Blest?\" repeats Jo, something troubled in\nhis mind. \"It an't done it much good if it is. Blest? I should think\nit was t'othered myself. But I don't know nothink!\"\n\nThe servant takes as little heed of what he says as she seems to take\nof what she has said herself. She draws off her glove to get some\nmoney from her purse. Jo silently notices how white and small her\nhand is and what a jolly servant she must be to wear such sparkling\nrings.\n\nShe drops a piece of money in his hand without touching it, and\nshuddering as their hands approach. \"Now,\" she adds, \"show me the\nspot again!\"\n\nJo thrusts the handle of his broom between the bars of the gate, and\nwith his utmost power of elaboration, points it out. At length,\nlooking aside to see if he has made himself intelligible, he finds\nthat he is alone.\n\nHis first proceeding is to hold the piece of money to the gas-light\nand to be overpowered at finding that it is yellow--gold. His next is\nto give it a one-sided bite at the edge as a test of its quality.\nHis next, to put it in his mouth for safety and to sweep the\nstep and passage with great care. His job done, he sets off for\nTom-all-Alone's, stopping in the light of innumerable gas-lamps to\nproduce the piece of gold and give it another one-sided bite as a\nreassurance of its being genuine.\n\nThe Mercury in powder is in no want of society to-night, for my Lady\ngoes to a grand dinner and three or four balls. Sir Leicester is\nfidgety down at Chesney Wold, with no better company than the gout;\nhe complains to Mrs. Rouncewell that the rain makes such a monotonous\npattering on the terrace that he can't read the paper even by the\nfireside in his own snug dressing-room.\n\n\"Sir Leicester would have done better to try the other side of the\nhouse, my dear,\" says Mrs. Rouncewell to Rosa. \"His dressing-room is\non my Lady's side. And in all these years I never heard the step upon\nthe Ghost's Walk more distinct than it is to-night!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVII\n\nEsther's Narrative\n\n\nRichard very often came to see us while we remained in London (though\nhe soon failed in his letter-writing), and with his quick abilities,\nhis good spirits, his good temper, his gaiety and freshness, was\nalways delightful. But though I liked him more and more the better I\nknew him, I still felt more and more how much it was to be regretted\nthat he had been educated in no habits of application and\nconcentration. The system which had addressed him in exactly the same\nmanner as it had addressed hundreds of other boys, all varying in\ncharacter and capacity, had enabled him to dash through his tasks,\nalways with fair credit and often with distinction, but in a fitful,\ndazzling way that had confirmed his reliance on those very qualities\nin himself which it had been most desirable to direct and train. They\nwere good qualities, without which no high place can be meritoriously\nwon, but like fire and water, though excellent servants, they were\nvery bad masters. If they had been under Richard's direction, they\nwould have been his friends; but Richard being under their direction,\nthey became his enemies.\n\nI write down these opinions not because I believe that this or any\nother thing was so because I thought so, but only because I did think\nso and I want to be quite candid about all I thought and did. These\nwere my thoughts about Richard. I thought I often observed besides\nhow right my guardian was in what he had said, and that the\nuncertainties and delays of the Chancery suit had imparted to his\nnature something of the careless spirit of a gamester who felt that\nhe was part of a great gaming system.\n\nMr. and Mrs. Bayham Badger coming one afternoon when my guardian was\nnot at home, in the course of conversation I naturally inquired after\nRichard.\n\n\"Why, Mr. Carstone,\" said Mrs. Badger, \"is very well and is, I assure\nyou, a great acquisition to our society. Captain Swosser used to say\nof me that I was always better than land a-head and a breeze a-starn\nto the midshipmen's mess when the purser's junk had become as tough\nas the fore-topsel weather earings. It was his naval way of\nmentioning generally that I was an acquisition to any society. I may\nrender the same tribute, I am sure, to Mr. Carstone. But I--you won't\nthink me premature if I mention it?\"\n\nI said no, as Mrs. Badger's insinuating tone seemed to require such\nan answer.\n\n\"Nor Miss Clare?\" said Mrs. Bayham Badger sweetly.\n\nAda said no, too, and looked uneasy.\n\n\"Why, you see, my dears,\" said Mrs. Badger, \"--you'll excuse me\ncalling you my dears?\"\n\nWe entreated Mrs. Badger not to mention it.\n\n\"Because you really are, if I may take the liberty of saying so,\"\npursued Mrs. Badger, \"so perfectly charming. You see, my dears, that\nalthough I am still young--or Mr. Bayham Badger pays me the\ncompliment of saying so--\"\n\n\"No,\" Mr. Badger called out like some one contradicting at a public\nmeeting. \"Not at all!\"\n\n\"Very well,\" smiled Mrs. Badger, \"we will say still young.\"\n\n\"Undoubtedly,\" said Mr. Badger.\n\n\"My dears, though still young, I have had many opportunities of\nobserving young men. There were many such on board the dear old\nCrippler, I assure you. After that, when I was with Captain Swosser\nin the Mediterranean, I embraced every opportunity of knowing and\nbefriending the midshipmen under Captain Swosser's command. YOU never\nheard them called the young gentlemen, my dears, and probably would\nnot understand allusions to their pipe-claying their weekly accounts,\nbut it is otherwise with me, for blue water has been a second home to\nme, and I have been quite a sailor. Again, with Professor Dingo.\"\n\n\"A man of European reputation,\" murmured Mr. Badger.\n\n\"When I lost my dear first and became the wife of my dear second,\"\nsaid Mrs. Badger, speaking of her former husbands as if they were\nparts of a charade, \"I still enjoyed opportunities of observing\nyouth. The class attendant on Professor Dingo's lectures was a large\none, and it became my pride, as the wife of an eminent scientific man\nseeking herself in science the utmost consolation it could impart, to\nthrow our house open to the students as a kind of Scientific\nExchange. Every Tuesday evening there was lemonade and a mixed\nbiscuit for all who chose to partake of those refreshments. And there\nwas science to an unlimited extent.\"\n\n\"Remarkable assemblies those, Miss Summerson,\" said Mr. Badger\nreverentially. \"There must have been great intellectual friction\ngoing on there under the auspices of such a man!\"\n\n\"And now,\" pursued Mrs. Badger, \"now that I am the wife of my dear\nthird, Mr. Badger, I still pursue those habits of observation which\nwere formed during the lifetime of Captain Swosser and adapted to new\nand unexpected purposes during the lifetime of Professor Dingo. I\ntherefore have not come to the consideration of Mr. Carstone as a\nneophyte. And yet I am very much of the opinion, my dears, that he\nhas not chosen his profession advisedly.\"\n\nAda looked so very anxious now that I asked Mrs. Badger on what she\nfounded her supposition.\n\n\"My dear Miss Summerson,\" she replied, \"on Mr. Carstone's character\nand conduct. He is of such a very easy disposition that probably he\nwould never think it worth-while to mention how he really feels, but\nhe feels languid about the profession. He has not that positive\ninterest in it which makes it his vocation. If he has any decided\nimpression in reference to it, I should say it was that it is a\ntiresome pursuit. Now, this is not promising. Young men like Mr.\nAllan Woodcourt who take it from a strong interest in all that it can\ndo will find some reward in it through a great deal of work for a\nvery little money and through years of considerable endurance and\ndisappointment. But I am quite convinced that this would never be the\ncase with Mr. Carstone.\"\n\n\"Does Mr. Badger think so too?\" asked Ada timidly.\n\n\"Why,\" said Mr. Badger, \"to tell the truth, Miss Clare, this view of\nthe matter had not occurred to me until Mrs. Badger mentioned it. But\nwhen Mrs. Badger put it in that light, I naturally gave great\nconsideration to it, knowing that Mrs. Badger's mind, in addition to\nits natural advantages, has had the rare advantage of being formed by\ntwo such very distinguished (I will even say illustrious) public men\nas Captain Swosser of the Royal Navy and Professor Dingo. The\nconclusion at which I have arrived is--in short, is Mrs. Badger's\nconclusion.\"\n\n\"It was a maxim of Captain Swosser's,\" said Mrs. Badger, \"speaking in\nhis figurative naval manner, that when you make pitch hot, you cannot\nmake it too hot; and that if you only have to swab a plank, you\nshould swab it as if Davy Jones were after you. It appears to me that\nthis maxim is applicable to the medical as well as to the nautical\nprofession.\n\n\"To all professions,\" observed Mr. Badger. \"It was admirably said by\nCaptain Swosser. Beautifully said.\"\n\n\"People objected to Professor Dingo when we were staying in the north\nof Devon after our marriage,\" said Mrs. Badger, \"that he disfigured\nsome of the houses and other buildings by chipping off fragments of\nthose edifices with his little geological hammer. But the professor\nreplied that he knew of no building save the Temple of Science. The\nprinciple is the same, I think?\"\n\n\"Precisely the same,\" said Mr. Badger. \"Finely expressed! The\nprofessor made the same remark, Miss Summerson, in his last illness,\nwhen (his mind wandering) he insisted on keeping his little hammer\nunder the pillow and chipping at the countenances of the attendants.\nThe ruling passion!\"\n\nAlthough we could have dispensed with the length at which Mr. and\nMrs. Badger pursued the conversation, we both felt that it was\ndisinterested in them to express the opinion they had communicated to\nus and that there was a great probability of its being sound. We\nagreed to say nothing to Mr. Jarndyce until we had spoken to Richard;\nand as he was coming next evening, we resolved to have a very serious\ntalk with him.\n\nSo after he had been a little while with Ada, I went in and found my\ndarling (as I knew she would be) prepared to consider him thoroughly\nright in whatever he said.\n\n\"And how do you get on, Richard?\" said I. I always sat down on the\nother side of him. He made quite a sister of me.\n\n\"Oh! Well enough!\" said Richard.\n\n\"He can't say better than that, Esther, can he?\" cried my pet\ntriumphantly.\n\nI tried to look at my pet in the wisest manner, but of course I\ncouldn't.\n\n\"Well enough?\" I repeated.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Richard, \"well enough. It's rather jog-trotty and\nhumdrum. But it'll do as well as anything else!\"\n\n\"Oh! My dear Richard!\" I remonstrated.\n\n\"What's the matter?\" said Richard.\n\n\"Do as well as anything else!\"\n\n\"I don't think there's any harm in that, Dame Durden,\" said Ada,\nlooking so confidingly at me across him; \"because if it will do as\nwell as anything else, it will do very well, I hope.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, I hope so,\" returned Richard, carelessly tossing his hair\nfrom his forehead. \"After all, it may be only a kind of probation\ntill our suit is--I forgot though. I am not to mention the suit.\nForbidden ground! Oh, yes, it's all right enough. Let us talk about\nsomething else.\"\n\nAda would have done so willingly, and with a full persuasion that we\nhad brought the question to a most satisfactory state. But I thought\nit would be useless to stop there, so I began again.\n\n\"No, but Richard,\" said I, \"and my dear Ada! Consider how important\nit is to you both, and what a point of honour it is towards your\ncousin, that you, Richard, should be quite in earnest without any\nreservation. I think we had better talk about this, really, Ada. It\nwill be too late very soon.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes! We must talk about it!\" said Ada. \"But I think Richard is\nright.\"\n\nWhat was the use of my trying to look wise when she was so pretty,\nand so engaging, and so fond of him!\n\n\"Mr. and Mrs. Badger were here yesterday, Richard,\" said I, \"and they\nseemed disposed to think that you had no great liking for the\nprofession.\"\n\n\"Did they though?\" said Richard. \"Oh! Well, that rather alters the\ncase, because I had no idea that they thought so, and I should not\nhave liked to disappoint or inconvenience them. The fact is, I don't\ncare much about it. But, oh, it don't matter! It'll do as well as\nanything else!\"\n\n\"You hear him, Ada!\" said I.\n\n\"The fact is,\" Richard proceeded, half thoughtfully and half\njocosely, \"it is not quite in my way. I don't take to it. And I get\ntoo much of Mrs. Bayham Badger's first and second.\"\n\n\"I am sure THAT'S very natural!\" cried Ada, quite delighted. \"The\nvery thing we both said yesterday, Esther!\"\n\n\"Then,\" pursued Richard, \"it's monotonous, and to-day is too like\nyesterday, and to-morrow is too like to-day.\"\n\n\"But I am afraid,\" said I, \"this is an objection to all kinds of\napplication--to life itself, except under some very uncommon\ncircumstances.\"\n\n\"Do you think so?\" returned Richard, still considering. \"Perhaps! Ha!\nWhy, then, you know,\" he added, suddenly becoming gay again, \"we\ntravel outside a circle to what I said just now. It'll do as well as\nanything else. Oh, it's all right enough! Let us talk about something\nelse.\"\n\nBut even Ada, with her loving face--and if it had seemed innocent and\ntrusting when I first saw it in that memorable November fog, how much\nmore did it seem now when I knew her innocent and trusting\nheart--even Ada shook her head at this and looked serious. So I\nthought it a good opportunity to hint to Richard that if he were\nsometimes a little careless of himself, I was very sure he never\nmeant to be careless of Ada, and that it was a part of his\naffectionate consideration for her not to slight the importance of a\nstep that might influence both their lives. This made him almost\ngrave.\n\n\"My dear Mother Hubbard,\" he said, \"that's the very thing! I have\nthought of that several times and have been quite angry with myself\nfor meaning to be so much in earnest and--somehow--not exactly being\nso. I don't know how it is; I seem to want something or other to\nstand by. Even you have no idea how fond I am of Ada (my darling\ncousin, I love you, so much!), but I don't settle down to constancy\nin other things. It's such uphill work, and it takes such a time!\"\nsaid Richard with an air of vexation.\n\n\"That may be,\" I suggested, \"because you don't like what you have\nchosen.\"\n\n\"Poor fellow!\" said Ada. \"I am sure I don't wonder at it!\"\n\nNo. It was not of the least use my trying to look wise. I tried\nagain, but how could I do it, or how could it have any effect if I\ncould, while Ada rested her clasped hands upon his shoulder and while\nhe looked at her tender blue eyes, and while they looked at him!\n\n\"You see, my precious girl,\" said Richard, passing her golden curls\nthrough and through his hand, \"I was a little hasty perhaps; or I\nmisunderstood my own inclinations perhaps. They don't seem to lie in\nthat direction. I couldn't tell till I tried. Now the question is\nwhether it's worth-while to undo all that has been done. It seems\nlike making a great disturbance about nothing particular.\"\n\n\"My dear Richard,\" said I, \"how CAN you say about nothing\nparticular?\"\n\n\"I don't mean absolutely that,\" he returned. \"I mean that it MAY be\nnothing particular because I may never want it.\"\n\nBoth Ada and I urged, in reply, not only that it was decidedly\nworth-while to undo what had been done, but that it must be undone. I\nthen asked Richard whether he had thought of any more congenial\npursuit.\n\n\"There, my dear Mrs. Shipton,\" said Richard, \"you touch me home. Yes,\nI have. I have been thinking that the law is the boy for me.\"\n\n\"The law!\" repeated Ada as if she were afraid of the name.\n\n\"If I went into Kenge's office,\" said Richard, \"and if I were placed\nunder articles to Kenge, I should have my eye on the--hum!--the\nforbidden ground--and should be able to study it, and master it, and\nto satisfy myself that it was not neglected and was being properly\nconducted. I should be able to look after Ada's interests and my own\ninterests (the same thing!); and I should peg away at Blackstone and\nall those fellows with the most tremendous ardour.\"\n\nI was not by any means so sure of that, and I saw how his hankering\nafter the vague things yet to come of those long-deferred hopes cast\na shade on Ada's face. But I thought it best to encourage him in any\nproject of continuous exertion, and only advised him to be quite sure\nthat his mind was made up now.\n\n\"My dear Minerva,\" said Richard, \"I am as steady as you are. I made a\nmistake; we are all liable to mistakes; I won't do so any more, and\nI'll become such a lawyer as is not often seen. That is, you know,\"\nsaid Richard, relapsing into doubt, \"if it really is worth-while,\nafter all, to make such a disturbance about nothing particular!\"\n\nThis led to our saying again, with a great deal of gravity, all that\nwe had said already and to our coming to much the same conclusion\nafterwards. But we so strongly advised Richard to be frank and open\nwith Mr. Jarndyce, without a moment's delay, and his disposition was\nnaturally so opposed to concealment that he sought him out at once\n(taking us with him) and made a full avowal. \"Rick,\" said my\nguardian, after hearing him attentively, \"we can retreat with honour,\nand we will. But we must be careful--for our cousin's sake, Rick, for\nour cousin's sake--that we make no more such mistakes. Therefore, in\nthe matter of the law, we will have a good trial before we decide. We\nwill look before we leap, and take plenty of time about it.\"\n\nRichard's energy was of such an impatient and fitful kind that he\nwould have liked nothing better than to have gone to Mr. Kenge's\noffice in that hour and to have entered into articles with him on the\nspot. Submitting, however, with a good grace to the caution that we\nhad shown to be so necessary, he contented himself with sitting down\namong us in his lightest spirits and talking as if his one unvarying\npurpose in life from childhood had been that one which now held\npossession of him. My guardian was very kind and cordial with him,\nbut rather grave, enough so to cause Ada, when he had departed and we\nwere going upstairs to bed, to say, \"Cousin John, I hope you don't\nthink the worse of Richard?\"\n\n\"No, my love,\" said he.\n\n\"Because it was very natural that Richard should be mistaken in such\na difficult case. It is not uncommon.\"\n\n\"No, no, my love,\" said he. \"Don't look unhappy.\"\n\n\"Oh, I am not unhappy, cousin John!\" said Ada, smiling cheerfully,\nwith her hand upon his shoulder, where she had put it in bidding him\ngood night. \"But I should be a little so if you thought at all the\nworse of Richard.\"\n\n\"My dear,\" said Mr. Jarndyce, \"I should think the worse of him only\nif you were ever in the least unhappy through his means. I should be\nmore disposed to quarrel with myself even then, than with poor Rick,\nfor I brought you together. But, tut, all this is nothing! He has\ntime before him, and the race to run. I think the worse of him? Not\nI, my loving cousin! And not you, I swear!\"\n\n\"No, indeed, cousin John,\" said Ada, \"I am sure I could not--I am\nsure I would not--think any ill of Richard if the whole world did. I\ncould, and I would, think better of him then than at any other time!\"\n\nSo quietly and honestly she said it, with her hands upon his\nshoulders--both hands now--and looking up into his face, like the\npicture of truth!\n\n\"I think,\" said my guardian, thoughtfully regarding her, \"I think it\nmust be somewhere written that the virtues of the mothers shall\noccasionally be visited on the children, as well as the sins of the\nfather. Good night, my rosebud. Good night, little woman. Pleasant\nslumbers! Happy dreams!\"\n\nThis was the first time I ever saw him follow Ada with his eyes with\nsomething of a shadow on their benevolent expression. I well\nremembered the look with which he had contemplated her and Richard\nwhen she was singing in the firelight; it was but a very little while\nsince he had watched them passing down the room in which the sun was\nshining, and away into the shade; but his glance was changed, and\neven the silent look of confidence in me which now followed it once\nmore was not quite so hopeful and untroubled as it had originally\nbeen.\n\nAda praised Richard more to me that night than ever she had praised\nhim yet. She went to sleep with a little bracelet he had given her\nclasped upon her arm. I fancied she was dreaming of him when I kissed\nher cheek after she had slept an hour and saw how tranquil and happy\nshe looked.\n\nFor I was so little inclined to sleep myself that night that I sat up\nworking. It would not be worth mentioning for its own sake, but I was\nwakeful and rather low-spirited. I don't know why. At least I don't\nthink I know why. At least, perhaps I do, but I don't think it\nmatters.\n\nAt any rate, I made up my mind to be so dreadfully industrious that I\nwould leave myself not a moment's leisure to be low-spirited. For I\nnaturally said, \"Esther! You to be low-spirited. YOU!\" And it really\nwas time to say so, for I--yes, I really did see myself in the glass,\nalmost crying. \"As if you had anything to make you unhappy, instead\nof everything to make you happy, you ungrateful heart!\" said I.\n\nIf I could have made myself go to sleep, I would have done it\ndirectly, but not being able to do that, I took out of my basket some\nornamental work for our house (I mean Bleak House) that I was busy\nwith at that time and sat down to it with great determination. It was\nnecessary to count all the stitches in that work, and I resolved to\ngo on with it until I couldn't keep my eyes open, and then to go to\nbed.\n\nI soon found myself very busy. But I had left some silk downstairs in\na work-table drawer in the temporary growlery, and coming to a stop\nfor want of it, I took my candle and went softly down to get it. To\nmy great surprise, on going in I found my guardian still there, and\nsitting looking at the ashes. He was lost in thought, his book lay\nunheeded by his side, his silvered iron-grey hair was scattered\nconfusedly upon his forehead as though his hand had been wandering\namong it while his thoughts were elsewhere, and his face looked worn.\nAlmost frightened by coming upon him so unexpectedly, I stood still\nfor a moment and should have retired without speaking had he not, in\nagain passing his hand abstractedly through his hair, seen me and\nstarted.\n\n\"Esther!\"\n\nI told him what I had come for.\n\n\"At work so late, my dear?\"\n\n\"I am working late to-night,\" said I, \"because I couldn't sleep and\nwished to tire myself. But, dear guardian, you are late too, and look\nweary. You have no trouble, I hope, to keep you waking?\"\n\n\"None, little woman, that YOU would readily understand,\" said he.\n\nHe spoke in a regretful tone so new to me that I inwardly repeated,\nas if that would help me to his meaning, \"That I could readily\nunderstand!\"\n\n\"Remain a moment, Esther,\" said he, \"You were in my thoughts.\"\n\n\"I hope I was not the trouble, guardian?\"\n\nHe slightly waved his hand and fell into his usual manner. The change\nwas so remarkable, and he appeared to make it by dint of so much\nself-command, that I found myself again inwardly repeating, \"None\nthat I could understand!\"\n\n\"Little woman,\" said my guardian, \"I was thinking--that is, I have\nbeen thinking since I have been sitting here--that you ought to know\nof your own history all I know. It is very little. Next to nothing.\"\n\n\"Dear guardian,\" I replied, \"when you spoke to me before on that\nsubject--\"\n\n\"But since then,\" he gravely interposed, anticipating what I meant to\nsay, \"I have reflected that your having anything to ask me, and my\nhaving anything to tell you, are different considerations, Esther. It\nis perhaps my duty to impart to you the little I know.\"\n\n\"If you think so, guardian, it is right.\"\n\n\"I think so,\" he returned very gently, and kindly, and very\ndistinctly. \"My dear, I think so now. If any real disadvantage can\nattach to your position in the mind of any man or woman worth a\nthought, it is right that you at least of all the world should not\nmagnify it to yourself by having vague impressions of its nature.\"\n\nI sat down and said after a little effort to be as calm as I ought to\nbe, \"One of my earliest remembrances, guardian, is of these words:\n'Your mother, Esther, is your disgrace, and you were hers. The time\nwill come, and soon enough, when you will understand this better, and\nwill feel it too, as no one save a woman can.'\" I had covered my face\nwith my hands in repeating the words, but I took them away now with a\nbetter kind of shame, I hope, and told him that to him I owed the\nblessing that I had from my childhood to that hour never, never,\nnever felt it. He put up his hand as if to stop me. I well knew that\nhe was never to be thanked, and said no more.\n\n\"Nine years, my dear,\" he said after thinking for a little while,\n\"have passed since I received a letter from a lady living in\nseclusion, written with a stern passion and power that rendered it\nunlike all other letters I have ever read. It was written to me (as\nit told me in so many words), perhaps because it was the writer's\nidiosyncrasy to put that trust in me, perhaps because it was mine to\njustify it. It told me of a child, an orphan girl then twelve years\nold, in some such cruel words as those which live in your\nremembrance. It told me that the writer had bred her in secrecy from\nher birth, had blotted out all trace of her existence, and that if\nthe writer were to die before the child became a woman, she would be\nleft entirely friendless, nameless, and unknown. It asked me to\nconsider if I would, in that case, finish what the writer had begun.\"\n\nI listened in silence and looked attentively at him.\n\n\"Your early recollection, my dear, will supply the gloomy medium\nthrough which all this was seen and expressed by the writer, and the\ndistorted religion which clouded her mind with impressions of the\nneed there was for the child to expiate an offence of which she was\nquite innocent. I felt concerned for the little creature, in her\ndarkened life, and replied to the letter.\"\n\nI took his hand and kissed it.\n\n\"It laid the injunction on me that I should never propose to see the\nwriter, who had long been estranged from all intercourse with the\nworld, but who would see a confidential agent if I would appoint one.\nI accredited Mr. Kenge. The lady said, of her own accord and not of\nhis seeking, that her name was an assumed one. That she was, if there\nwere any ties of blood in such a case, the child's aunt. That more\nthan this she would never (and he was well persuaded of the\nsteadfastness of her resolution) for any human consideration\ndisclose. My dear, I have told you all.\"\n\nI held his hand for a little while in mine.\n\n\"I saw my ward oftener than she saw me,\" he added, cheerily making\nlight of it, \"and I always knew she was beloved, useful, and happy.\nShe repays me twenty-thousandfold, and twenty more to that, every\nhour in every day!\"\n\n\"And oftener still,\" said I, \"she blesses the guardian who is a\nfather to her!\"\n\nAt the word father, I saw his former trouble come into his face. He\nsubdued it as before, and it was gone in an instant; but it had been\nthere and it had come so swiftly upon my words that I felt as if they\nhad given him a shock. I again inwardly repeated, wondering, \"That I\ncould readily understand. None that I could readily understand!\" No,\nit was true. I did not understand it. Not for many and many a day.\n\n\"Take a fatherly good night, my dear,\" said he, kissing me on the\nforehead, \"and so to rest. These are late hours for working and\nthinking. You do that for all of us, all day long, little\nhousekeeper!\"\n\nI neither worked nor thought any more that night. I opened my\ngrateful heart to heaven in thankfulness for its providence to me and\nits care of me, and fell asleep.\n\nWe had a visitor next day. Mr. Allan Woodcourt came. He came to take\nleave of us; he had settled to do so beforehand. He was going to\nChina and to India as a surgeon on board ship. He was to be away a\nlong, long time.\n\nI believe--at least I know--that he was not rich. All his widowed\nmother could spare had been spent in qualifying him for his\nprofession. It was not lucrative to a young practitioner, with very\nlittle influence in London; and although he was, night and day, at\nthe service of numbers of poor people and did wonders of gentleness\nand skill for them, he gained very little by it in money. He was\nseven years older than I. Not that I need mention it, for it hardly\nseems to belong to anything.\n\nI think--I mean, he told us--that he had been in practice three or\nfour years and that if he could have hoped to contend through three\nor four more, he would not have made the voyage on which he was\nbound. But he had no fortune or private means, and so he was going\naway. He had been to see us several times altogether. We thought it a\npity he should go away. Because he was distinguished in his art among\nthose who knew it best, and some of the greatest men belonging to it\nhad a high opinion of him.\n\nWhen he came to bid us good-bye, he brought his mother with him for\nthe first time. She was a pretty old lady, with bright black eyes,\nbut she seemed proud. She came from Wales and had had, a long time\nago, an eminent person for an ancestor, of the name of Morgan\nap-Kerrig--of some place that sounded like Gimlet--who was the most\nillustrious person that ever was known and all of whose relations\nwere a sort of royal family. He appeared to have passed his life\nin always getting up into mountains and fighting somebody; and\na bard whose name sounded like Crumlinwallinwer had sung his\npraises in a piece which was called, as nearly as I could catch it,\nMewlinnwillinwodd.\n\nMrs. Woodcourt, after expatiating to us on the fame of her great\nkinsman, said that no doubt wherever her son Allan went he would\nremember his pedigree and would on no account form an alliance below\nit. She told him that there were many handsome English ladies in\nIndia who went out on speculation, and that there were some to be\npicked up with property, but that neither charms nor wealth would\nsuffice for the descendant from such a line without birth, which must\never be the first consideration. She talked so much about birth that\nfor a moment I half fancied, and with pain--But what an idle fancy to\nsuppose that she could think or care what MINE was!\n\nMr. Woodcourt seemed a little distressed by her prolixity, but he was\ntoo considerate to let her see it and contrived delicately to bring\nthe conversation round to making his acknowledgments to my guardian\nfor his hospitality and for the very happy hours--he called them the\nvery happy hours--he had passed with us. The recollection of them, he\nsaid, would go with him wherever he went and would be always\ntreasured. And so we gave him our hands, one after another--at least,\nthey did--and I did; and so he put his lips to Ada's hand--and to\nmine; and so he went away upon his long, long voyage!\n\nI was very busy indeed all day and wrote directions home to the\nservants, and wrote notes for my guardian, and dusted his books and\npapers, and jingled my housekeeping keys a good deal, one way and\nanother. I was still busy between the lights, singing and working by\nthe window, when who should come in but Caddy, whom I had no\nexpectation of seeing!\n\n\"Why, Caddy, my dear,\" said I, \"what beautiful flowers!\"\n\nShe had such an exquisite little nosegay in her hand.\n\n\"Indeed, I think so, Esther,\" replied Caddy. \"They are the loveliest\nI ever saw.\"\n\n\"Prince, my dear?\" said I in a whisper.\n\n\"No,\" answered Caddy, shaking her head and holding them to me to\nsmell. \"Not Prince.\"\n\n\"Well, to be sure, Caddy!\" said I. \"You must have two lovers!\"\n\n\"What? Do they look like that sort of thing?\" said Caddy.\n\n\"Do they look like that sort of thing?\" I repeated, pinching her\ncheek.\n\nCaddy only laughed in return, and telling me that she had come for\nhalf an hour, at the expiration of which time Prince would be waiting\nfor her at the corner, sat chatting with me and Ada in the window,\nevery now and then handing me the flowers again or trying how they\nlooked against my hair. At last, when she was going, she took me into\nmy room and put them in my dress.\n\n\"For me?\" said I, surprised.\n\n\"For you,\" said Caddy with a kiss. \"They were left behind by\nsomebody.\"\n\n\"Left behind?\"\n\n\"At poor Miss Flite's,\" said Caddy. \"Somebody who has been very good\nto her was hurrying away an hour ago to join a ship and left these\nflowers behind. No, no! Don't take them out. Let the pretty little\nthings lie here,\" said Caddy, adjusting them with a careful hand,\n\"because I was present myself, and I shouldn't wonder if somebody\nleft them on purpose!\"\n\n\"Do they look like that sort of thing?\" said Ada, coming laughingly\nbehind me and clasping me merrily round the waist. \"Oh, yes, indeed\nthey do, Dame Durden! They look very, very like that sort of thing.\nOh, very like it indeed, my dear!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVIII\n\nLady Dedlock\n\n\nIt was not so easy as it had appeared at first to arrange for\nRichard's making a trial of Mr. Kenge's office. Richard himself was\nthe chief impediment. As soon as he had it in his power to leave Mr.\nBadger at any moment, he began to doubt whether he wanted to leave\nhim at all. He didn't know, he said, really. It wasn't a bad\nprofession; he couldn't assert that he disliked it; perhaps he liked\nit as well as he liked any other--suppose he gave it one more chance!\nUpon that, he shut himself up for a few weeks with some books and\nsome bones and seemed to acquire a considerable fund of information\nwith great rapidity. His fervour, after lasting about a month, began\nto cool, and when it was quite cooled, began to grow warm again. His\nvacillations between law and medicine lasted so long that midsummer\narrived before he finally separated from Mr. Badger and entered on an\nexperimental course of Messrs. Kenge and Carboy. For all his\nwaywardness, he took great credit to himself as being determined to\nbe in earnest \"this time.\" And he was so good-natured throughout, and\nin such high spirits, and so fond of Ada, that it was very difficult\nindeed to be otherwise than pleased with him.\n\n\"As to Mr. Jarndyce,\" who, I may mention, found the wind much given,\nduring this period, to stick in the east; \"As to Mr. Jarndyce,\"\nRichard would say to me, \"he is the finest fellow in the world,\nEsther! I must be particularly careful, if it were only for his\nsatisfaction, to take myself well to task and have a regular wind-up\nof this business now.\"\n\nThe idea of his taking himself well to task, with that laughing face\nand heedless manner and with a fancy that everything could catch and\nnothing could hold, was ludicrously anomalous. However, he told us\nbetween-whiles that he was doing it to such an extent that he\nwondered his hair didn't turn grey. His regular wind-up of the\nbusiness was (as I have said) that he went to Mr. Kenge's about\nmidsummer to try how he liked it.\n\nAll this time he was, in money affairs, what I have described him in\na former illustration--generous, profuse, wildly careless, but fully\npersuaded that he was rather calculating and prudent. I happened to\nsay to Ada, in his presence, half jestingly, half seriously, about\nthe time of his going to Mr. Kenge's, that he needed to have\nFortunatus' purse, he made so light of money, which he answered in\nthis way, \"My jewel of a dear cousin, you hear this old woman! Why\ndoes she say that? Because I gave eight pounds odd (or whatever it\nwas) for a certain neat waistcoat and buttons a few days ago. Now, if\nI had stayed at Badger's I should have been obliged to spend twelve\npounds at a blow for some heart-breaking lecture-fees. So I make four\npounds--in a lump--by the transaction!\"\n\nIt was a question much discussed between him and my guardian what\narrangements should be made for his living in London while he\nexperimented on the law, for we had long since gone back to Bleak\nHouse, and it was too far off to admit of his coming there oftener\nthan once a week. My guardian told me that if Richard were to settle\ndown at Mr. Kenge's he would take some apartments or chambers where\nwe too could occasionally stay for a few days at a time; \"but, little\nwoman,\" he added, rubbing his head very significantly, \"he hasn't\nsettled down there yet!\" The discussions ended in our hiring for him,\nby the month, a neat little furnished lodging in a quiet old house\nnear Queen Square. He immediately began to spend all the money he had\nin buying the oddest little ornaments and luxuries for this lodging;\nand so often as Ada and I dissuaded him from making any purchase that\nhe had in contemplation which was particularly unnecessary and\nexpensive, he took credit for what it would have cost and made out\nthat to spend anything less on something else was to save the\ndifference.\n\nWhile these affairs were in abeyance, our visit to Mr. Boythorn's was\npostponed. At length, Richard having taken possession of his lodging,\nthere was nothing to prevent our departure. He could have gone with\nus at that time of the year very well, but he was in the full novelty\nof his new position and was making most energetic attempts to unravel\nthe mysteries of the fatal suit. Consequently we went without him,\nand my darling was delighted to praise him for being so busy.\n\nWe made a pleasant journey down into Lincolnshire by the coach and\nhad an entertaining companion in Mr. Skimpole. His furniture had been\nall cleared off, it appeared, by the person who took possession of it\non his blue-eyed daughter's birthday, but he seemed quite relieved to\nthink that it was gone. Chairs and table, he said, were wearisome\nobjects; they were monotonous ideas, they had no variety of\nexpression, they looked you out of countenance, and you looked them\nout of countenance. How pleasant, then, to be bound to no particular\nchairs and tables, but to sport like a butterfly among all the\nfurniture on hire, and to flit from rosewood to mahogany, and from\nmahogany to walnut, and from this shape to that, as the humour took\none!\n\n\"The oddity of the thing is,\" said Mr. Skimpole with a quickened\nsense of the ludicrous, \"that my chairs and tables were not paid for,\nand yet my landlord walks off with them as composedly as possible.\nNow, that seems droll! There is something grotesque in it. The chair\nand table merchant never engaged to pay my landlord my rent. Why\nshould my landlord quarrel with HIM? If I have a pimple on my nose\nwhich is disagreeable to my landlord's peculiar ideas of beauty, my\nlandlord has no business to scratch my chair and table merchant's\nnose, which has no pimple on it. His reasoning seems defective!\"\n\n\"Well,\" said my guardian good-humouredly, \"it's pretty clear that\nwhoever became security for those chairs and tables will have to pay\nfor them.\"\n\n\"Exactly!\" returned Mr. Skimpole. \"That's the crowning point of\nunreason in the business! I said to my landlord, 'My good man, you\nare not aware that my excellent friend Jarndyce will have to pay for\nthose things that you are sweeping off in that indelicate manner.\nHave you no consideration for HIS property?' He hadn't the least.\"\n\n\"And refused all proposals,\" said my guardian.\n\n\"Refused all proposals,\" returned Mr. Skimpole. \"I made him business\nproposals. I had him into my room. I said, 'You are a man of\nbusiness, I believe?' He replied, 'I am,' 'Very well,' said I, 'now\nlet us be business-like. Here is an inkstand, here are pens and\npaper, here are wafers. What do you want? I have occupied your house\nfor a considerable period, I believe to our mutual satisfaction until\nthis unpleasant misunderstanding arose; let us be at once friendly\nand business-like. What do you want?' In reply to this, he made use\nof the figurative expression--which has something Eastern about\nit--that he had never seen the colour of my money. 'My amiable\nfriend,' said I, 'I never have any money. I never know anything about\nmoney.' 'Well, sir,' said he, 'what do you offer if I give you time?'\n'My good fellow,' said I, 'I have no idea of time; but you say you\nare a man of business, and whatever you can suggest to be done in a\nbusiness-like way with pen, and ink, and paper--and wafers--I am\nready to do. Don't pay yourself at another man's expense (which is\nfoolish), but be business-like!' However, he wouldn't be, and there\nwas an end of it.\"\n\nIf these were some of the inconveniences of Mr. Skimpole's childhood,\nit assuredly possessed its advantages too. On the journey he had a\nvery good appetite for such refreshment as came in our way (including\na basket of choice hothouse peaches), but never thought of paying for\nanything. So when the coachman came round for his fee, he pleasantly\nasked him what he considered a very good fee indeed, now--a liberal\none--and on his replying half a crown for a single passenger, said it\nwas little enough too, all things considered, and left Mr. Jarndyce\nto give it him.\n\nIt was delightful weather. The green corn waved so beautifully, the\nlarks sang so joyfully, the hedges were so full of wild flowers, the\ntrees were so thickly out in leaf, the bean-fields, with a light wind\nblowing over them, filled the air with such a delicious fragrance!\nLate in the afternoon we came to the market-town where we were to\nalight from the coach--a dull little town with a church-spire, and a\nmarketplace, and a market-cross, and one intensely sunny street, and\na pond with an old horse cooling his legs in it, and a very few men\nsleepily lying and standing about in narrow little bits of shade.\nAfter the rustling of the leaves and the waving of the corn all along\nthe road, it looked as still, as hot, as motionless a little town as\nEngland could produce.\n\nAt the inn we found Mr. Boythorn on horseback, waiting with an open\ncarriage to take us to his house, which was a few miles off. He was\noverjoyed to see us and dismounted with great alacrity.\n\n\"By heaven!\" said he after giving us a courteous greeting. \"This a\nmost infamous coach. It is the most flagrant example of an abominable\npublic vehicle that ever encumbered the face of the earth. It is\ntwenty-five minutes after its time this afternoon. The coachman ought\nto be put to death!\"\n\n\"IS he after his time?\" said Mr. Skimpole, to whom he happened to\naddress himself. \"You know my infirmity.\"\n\n\"Twenty-five minutes! Twenty-six minutes!\" replied Mr. Boythorn,\nreferring to his watch. \"With two ladies in the coach, this scoundrel\nhas deliberately delayed his arrival six and twenty minutes.\nDeliberately! It is impossible that it can be accidental! But his\nfather--and his uncle--were the most profligate coachmen that ever\nsat upon a box.\"\n\nWhile he said this in tones of the greatest indignation, he handed us\ninto the little phaeton with the utmost gentleness and was all smiles\nand pleasure.\n\n\"I am sorry, ladies,\" he said, standing bare-headed at the\ncarriage-door when all was ready, \"that I am obliged to conduct you\nnearly two miles out of the way. But our direct road lies through Sir\nLeicester Dedlock's park, and in that fellow's property I have sworn\nnever to set foot of mine, or horse's foot of mine, pending the\npresent relations between us, while I breathe the breath of life!\"\nAnd here, catching my guardian's eye, he broke into one of his\ntremendous laughs, which seemed to shake even the motionless little\nmarket-town.\n\n\"Are the Dedlocks down here, Lawrence?\" said my guardian as we drove\nalong and Mr. Boythorn trotted on the green turf by the roadside.\n\n\"Sir Arrogant Numskull is here,\" replied Mr. Boythorn. \"Ha ha ha! Sir\nArrogant is here, and I am glad to say, has been laid by the heels\nhere. My Lady,\" in naming whom he always made a courtly gesture as if\nparticularly to exclude her from any part in the quarrel, \"is\nexpected, I believe, daily. I am not in the least surprised that she\npostpones her appearance as long as possible. Whatever can have\ninduced that transcendent woman to marry that effigy and figure-head\nof a baronet is one of the most impenetrable mysteries that ever\nbaffled human inquiry. Ha ha ha ha!\"\n\n\"I suppose,\" said my guardian, laughing, \"WE may set foot in the park\nwhile we are here? The prohibition does not extend to us, does it?\"\n\n\"I can lay no prohibition on my guests,\" he said, bending his head to\nAda and me with the smiling politeness which sat so gracefully upon\nhim, \"except in the matter of their departure. I am only sorry that I\ncannot have the happiness of being their escort about Chesney Wold,\nwhich is a very fine place! But by the light of this summer day,\nJarndyce, if you call upon the owner while you stay with me, you are\nlikely to have but a cool reception. He carries himself like an\neight-day clock at all times, like one of a race of eight-day clocks\nin gorgeous cases that never go and never went--Ha ha ha!--but he\nwill have some extra stiffness, I can promise you, for the friends of\nhis friend and neighbour Boythorn!\"\n\n\"I shall not put him to the proof,\" said my guardian. \"He is as\nindifferent to the honour of knowing me, I dare say, as I am to the\nhonour of knowing him. The air of the grounds and perhaps such a view\nof the house as any other sightseer might get are quite enough for\nme.\"\n\n\"Well!\" said Mr. Boythorn. \"I am glad of it on the whole. It's in\nbetter keeping. I am looked upon about here as a second Ajax defying\nthe lightning. Ha ha ha ha! When I go into our little church on a\nSunday, a considerable part of the inconsiderable congregation expect\nto see me drop, scorched and withered, on the pavement under the\nDedlock displeasure. Ha ha ha ha! I have no doubt he is surprised\nthat I don't. For he is, by heaven, the most self-satisfied, and the\nshallowest, and the most coxcombical and utterly brainless ass!\"\n\nOur coming to the ridge of a hill we had been ascending enabled our\nfriend to point out Chesney Wold itself to us and diverted his\nattention from its master.\n\nIt was a picturesque old house in a fine park richly wooded. Among\nthe trees and not far from the residence he pointed out the spire of\nthe little church of which he had spoken. Oh, the solemn woods over\nwhich the light and shadow travelled swiftly, as if heavenly wings\nwere sweeping on benignant errands through the summer air; the smooth\ngreen slopes, the glittering water, the garden where the flowers were\nso symmetrically arranged in clusters of the richest colours, how\nbeautiful they looked! The house, with gable and chimney, and tower,\nand turret, and dark doorway, and broad terrace-walk, twining among\nthe balustrades of which, and lying heaped upon the vases, there was\none great flush of roses, seemed scarcely real in its light solidity\nand in the serene and peaceful hush that rested on all around it. To\nAda and to me, that above all appeared the pervading influence. On\neverything, house, garden, terrace, green slopes, water, old oaks,\nfern, moss, woods again, and far away across the openings in the\nprospect to the distance lying wide before us with a purple bloom\nupon it, there seemed to be such undisturbed repose.\n\nWhen we came into the little village and passed a small inn with the\nsign of the Dedlock Arms swinging over the road in front, Mr.\nBoythorn interchanged greetings with a young gentleman sitting on a\nbench outside the inn-door who had some fishing-tackle lying beside\nhim.\n\n\"That's the housekeeper's grandson, Mr. Rouncewell by name,\" said,\nhe, \"and he is in love with a pretty girl up at the house. Lady\nDedlock has taken a fancy to the pretty girl and is going to keep her\nabout her own fair person--an honour which my young friend himself\ndoes not at all appreciate. However, he can't marry just yet, even if\nhis Rosebud were willing; so he is fain to make the best of it. In\nthe meanwhile, he comes here pretty often for a day or two at a time\nto--fish. Ha ha ha ha!\"\n\n\"Are he and the pretty girl engaged, Mr. Boythorn?\" asked Ada.\n\n\"Why, my dear Miss Clare,\" he returned, \"I think they may perhaps\nunderstand each other; but you will see them soon, I dare say, and I\nmust learn from you on such a point--not you from me.\"\n\nAda blushed, and Mr. Boythorn, trotting forward on his comely grey\nhorse, dismounted at his own door and stood ready with extended arm\nand uncovered head to welcome us when we arrived.\n\nHe lived in a pretty house, formerly the parsonage house, with a lawn\nin front, a bright flower-garden at the side, and a well-stocked\norchard and kitchen-garden in the rear, enclosed with a venerable\nwall that had of itself a ripened ruddy look. But, indeed, everything\nabout the place wore an aspect of maturity and abundance. The old\nlime-tree walk was like green cloisters, the very shadows of the\ncherry-trees and apple-trees were heavy with fruit, the\ngooseberry-bushes were so laden that their branches arched and rested\non the earth, the strawberries and raspberries grew in like\nprofusion, and the peaches basked by the hundred on the wall. Tumbled\nabout among the spread nets and the glass frames sparkling and\nwinking in the sun there were such heaps of drooping pods, and\nmarrows, and cucumbers, that every foot of ground appeared a\nvegetable treasury, while the smell of sweet herbs and all kinds of\nwholesome growth (to say nothing of the neighbouring meadows where\nthe hay was carrying) made the whole air a great nosegay. Such\nstillness and composure reigned within the orderly precincts of the\nold red wall that even the feathers hung in garlands to scare the\nbirds hardly stirred; and the wall had such a ripening influence that\nwhere, here and there high up, a disused nail and scrap of list still\nclung to it, it was easy to fancy that they had mellowed with the\nchanging seasons and that they had rusted and decayed according to\nthe common fate.\n\nThe house, though a little disorderly in comparison with the garden,\nwas a real old house with settles in the chimney of the brick-floored\nkitchen and great beams across the ceilings. On one side of it was\nthe terrible piece of ground in dispute, where Mr. Boythorn\nmaintained a sentry in a smock-frock day and night, whose duty was\nsupposed to be, in cases of aggression, immediately to ring a large\nbell hung up there for the purpose, to unchain a great bull-dog\nestablished in a kennel as his ally, and generally to deal\ndestruction on the enemy. Not content with these precautions, Mr.\nBoythorn had himself composed and posted there, on painted boards to\nwhich his name was attached in large letters, the following solemn\nwarnings: \"Beware of the bull-dog. He is most ferocious. Lawrence\nBoythorn.\" \"The blunderbus is loaded with slugs. Lawrence Boythorn.\"\n\"Man-traps and spring-guns are set here at all times of the day and\nnight. Lawrence Boythorn.\" \"Take notice. That any person or persons\naudaciously presuming to trespass on this property will be punished\nwith the utmost severity of private chastisement and prosecuted with\nthe utmost rigour of the law. Lawrence Boythorn.\" These he showed us\nfrom the drawing-room window, while his bird was hopping about his\nhead, and he laughed, \"Ha ha ha ha! Ha ha ha ha!\" to that extent as\nhe pointed them out that I really thought he would have hurt himself.\n\n\"But this is taking a good deal of trouble,\" said Mr. Skimpole in his\nlight way, \"when you are not in earnest after all.\"\n\n\"Not in earnest!\" returned Mr. Boythorn with unspeakable warmth. \"Not\nin earnest! If I could have hoped to train him, I would have bought a\nlion instead of that dog and would have turned him loose upon the\nfirst intolerable robber who should dare to make an encroachment on\nmy rights. Let Sir Leicester Dedlock consent to come out and decide\nthis question by single combat, and I will meet him with any weapon\nknown to mankind in any age or country. I am that much in earnest.\nNot more!\"\n\nWe arrived at his house on a Saturday. On the Sunday morning we all\nset forth to walk to the little church in the park. Entering the\npark, almost immediately by the disputed ground, we pursued a\npleasant footpath winding among the verdant turf and the beautiful\ntrees until it brought us to the church-porch.\n\nThe congregation was extremely small and quite a rustic one with the\nexception of a large muster of servants from the house, some of whom\nwere already in their seats, while others were yet dropping in. There\nwere some stately footmen, and there was a perfect picture of an old\ncoachman, who looked as if he were the official representative of all\nthe pomps and vanities that had ever been put into his coach. There\nwas a very pretty show of young women, and above them, the handsome\nold face and fine responsible portly figure of the housekeeper\ntowered pre-eminent. The pretty girl of whom Mr. Boythorn had told us\nwas close by her. She was so very pretty that I might have known her\nby her beauty even if I had not seen how blushingly conscious she was\nof the eyes of the young fisherman, whom I discovered not far off.\nOne face, and not an agreeable one, though it was handsome, seemed\nmaliciously watchful of this pretty girl, and indeed of every one and\neverything there. It was a Frenchwoman's.\n\nAs the bell was yet ringing and the great people were not yet come, I\nhad leisure to glance over the church, which smelt as earthy as a\ngrave, and to think what a shady, ancient, solemn little church it\nwas. The windows, heavily shaded by trees, admitted a subdued light\nthat made the faces around me pale, and darkened the old brasses in\nthe pavement and the time and damp-worn monuments, and rendered the\nsunshine in the little porch, where a monotonous ringer was working\nat the bell, inestimably bright. But a stir in that direction, a\ngathering of reverential awe in the rustic faces, and a blandly\nferocious assumption on the part of Mr. Boythorn of being resolutely\nunconscious of somebody's existence forewarned me that the great\npeople were come and that the service was going to begin.\n\n\"'Enter not into judgment with thy servant, O Lord, for in thy\nsight--'\"\n\nShall I ever forget the rapid beating at my heart, occasioned by the\nlook I met as I stood up! Shall I ever forget the manner in which\nthose handsome proud eyes seemed to spring out of their languor and\nto hold mine! It was only a moment before I cast mine down--released\nagain, if I may say so--on my book; but I knew the beautiful face\nquite well in that short space of time.\n\nAnd, very strangely, there was something quickened within me,\nassociated with the lonely days at my godmother's; yes, away even to\nthe days when I had stood on tiptoe to dress myself at my little\nglass after dressing my doll. And this, although I had never seen\nthis lady's face before in all my life--I was quite sure of\nit--absolutely certain.\n\nIt was easy to know that the ceremonious, gouty, grey-haired\ngentleman, the only other occupant of the great pew, was Sir\nLeicester Dedlock, and that the lady was Lady Dedlock. But why her\nface should be, in a confused way, like a broken glass to me, in\nwhich I saw scraps of old remembrances, and why I should be so\nfluttered and troubled (for I was still) by having casually met her\neyes, I could not think.\n\nI felt it to be an unmeaning weakness in me and tried to overcome it\nby attending to the words I heard. Then, very strangely, I seemed to\nhear them, not in the reader's voice, but in the well-remembered\nvoice of my godmother. This made me think, did Lady Dedlock's face\naccidentally resemble my godmother's? It might be that it did, a\nlittle; but the expression was so different, and the stern decision\nwhich had worn into my godmother's face, like weather into rocks, was\nso completely wanting in the face before me that it could not be that\nresemblance which had struck me. Neither did I know the loftiness and\nhaughtiness of Lady Dedlock's face, at all, in any one. And yet I--I,\nlittle Esther Summerson, the child who lived a life apart and on\nwhose birthday there was no rejoicing--seemed to arise before my own\neyes, evoked out of the past by some power in this fashionable lady,\nwhom I not only entertained no fancy that I had ever seen, but whom I\nperfectly well knew I had never seen until that hour.\n\nIt made me tremble so to be thrown into this unaccountable agitation\nthat I was conscious of being distressed even by the observation of\nthe French maid, though I knew she had been looking watchfully here,\nand there, and everywhere, from the moment of her coming into the\nchurch. By degrees, though very slowly, I at last overcame my strange\nemotion. After a long time, I looked towards Lady Dedlock again. It\nwas while they were preparing to sing, before the sermon. She took no\nheed of me, and the beating at my heart was gone. Neither did it\nrevive for more than a few moments when she once or twice afterwards\nglanced at Ada or at me through her glass.\n\nThe service being concluded, Sir Leicester gave his arm with much\ntaste and gallantry to Lady Dedlock--though he was obliged to walk by\nthe help of a thick stick--and escorted her out of church to the pony\ncarriage in which they had come. The servants then dispersed, and so\ndid the congregation, whom Sir Leicester had contemplated all along\n(Mr. Skimpole said to Mr. Boythorn's infinite delight) as if he were\na considerable landed proprietor in heaven.\n\n\"He believes he is!\" said Mr. Boythorn. \"He firmly believes it. So\ndid his father, and his grandfather, and his great-grandfather!\"\n\n\"Do you know,\" pursued Mr. Skimpole very unexpectedly to Mr.\nBoythorn, \"it's agreeable to me to see a man of that sort.\"\n\n\"IS it!\" said Mr. Boythorn.\n\n\"Say that he wants to patronize me,\" pursued Mr. Skimpole. \"Very\nwell! I don't object.\"\n\n\"I do,\" said Mr. Boythorn with great vigour.\n\n\"Do you really?\" returned Mr. Skimpole in his easy light vein. \"But\nthat's taking trouble, surely. And why should you take trouble? Here\nam I, content to receive things childishly as they fall out, and I\nnever take trouble! I come down here, for instance, and I find a\nmighty potentate exacting homage. Very well! I say 'Mighty potentate,\nhere IS my homage! It's easier to give it than to withhold it. Here\nit is. If you have anything of an agreeable nature to show me, I\nshall be happy to see it; if you have anything of an agreeable nature\nto give me, I shall be happy to accept it.' Mighty potentate replies\nin effect, 'This is a sensible fellow. I find him accord with my\ndigestion and my bilious system. He doesn't impose upon me the\nnecessity of rolling myself up like a hedgehog with my points\noutward. I expand, I open, I turn my silver lining outward like\nMilton's cloud, and it's more agreeable to both of us.' That's my\nview of such things, speaking as a child!\"\n\n\"But suppose you went down somewhere else to-morrow,\" said Mr.\nBoythorn, \"where there was the opposite of that fellow--or of this\nfellow. How then?\"\n\n\"How then?\" said Mr. Skimpole with an appearance of the utmost\nsimplicity and candour. \"Just the same then! I should say, 'My\nesteemed Boythorn'--to make you the personification of our imaginary\nfriend--'my esteemed Boythorn, you object to the mighty potentate?\nVery good. So do I. I take it that my business in the social system\nis to be agreeable; I take it that everybody's business in the social\nsystem is to be agreeable. It's a system of harmony, in short.\nTherefore if you object, I object. Now, excellent Boythorn, let us go\nto dinner!'\"\n\n\"But excellent Boythorn might say,\" returned our host, swelling and\ngrowing very red, \"I'll be--\"\n\n\"I understand,\" said Mr. Skimpole. \"Very likely he would.\"\n\n\"--if I WILL go to dinner!\" cried Mr. Boythorn in a violent burst and\nstopping to strike his stick upon the ground. \"And he would probably\nadd, 'Is there such a thing as principle, Mr. Harold Skimpole?'\"\n\n\"To which Harold Skimpole would reply, you know,\" he returned in his\ngayest manner and with his most ingenuous smile, \"'Upon my life I\nhave not the least idea! I don't know what it is you call by that\nname, or where it is, or who possesses it. If you possess it and find\nit comfortable, I am quite delighted and congratulate you heartily.\nBut I know nothing about it, I assure you; for I am a mere child, and\nI lay no claim to it, and I don't want it!' So, you see, excellent\nBoythorn and I would go to dinner after all!\"\n\nThis was one of many little dialogues between them which I always\nexpected to end, and which I dare say would have ended under other\ncircumstances, in some violent explosion on the part of our host. But\nhe had so high a sense of his hospitable and responsible position as\nour entertainer, and my guardian laughed so sincerely at and with Mr.\nSkimpole, as a child who blew bubbles and broke them all day long,\nthat matters never went beyond this point. Mr. Skimpole, who always\nseemed quite unconscious of having been on delicate ground, then\nbetook himself to beginning some sketch in the park which he never\nfinished, or to playing fragments of airs on the piano, or to singing\nscraps of songs, or to lying down on his back under a tree and\nlooking at the sky--which he couldn't help thinking, he said, was\nwhat he was meant for; it suited him so exactly.\n\n\"Enterprise and effort,\" he would say to us (on his back), \"are\ndelightful to me. I believe I am truly cosmopolitan. I have the\ndeepest sympathy with them. I lie in a shady place like this and\nthink of adventurous spirits going to the North Pole or penetrating\nto the heart of the Torrid Zone with admiration. Mercenary creatures\nask, 'What is the use of a man's going to the North Pole? What good\ndoes it do?' I can't say; but, for anything I CAN say, he may go for\nthe purpose--though he don't know it--of employing my thoughts as I\nlie here. Take an extreme case. Take the case of the slaves on\nAmerican plantations. I dare say they are worked hard, I dare say\nthey don't altogether like it. I dare say theirs is an unpleasant\nexperience on the whole; but they people the landscape for me, they\ngive it a poetry for me, and perhaps that is one of the pleasanter\nobjects of their existence. I am very sensible of it, if it be, and I\nshouldn't wonder if it were!\"\n\nI always wondered on these occasions whether he ever thought of Mrs.\nSkimpole and the children, and in what point of view they presented\nthemselves to his cosmopolitan mind. So far as I could understand,\nthey rarely presented themselves at all.\n\nThe week had gone round to the Saturday following that beating of my\nheart in the church; and every day had been so bright and blue that\nto ramble in the woods, and to see the light striking down among the\ntransparent leaves and sparkling in the beautiful interlacings of the\nshadows of the trees, while the birds poured out their songs and the\nair was drowsy with the hum of insects, had been most delightful. We\nhad one favourite spot, deep in moss and last year's leaves, where\nthere were some felled trees from which the bark was all stripped\noff. Seated among these, we looked through a green vista supported by\nthousands of natural columns, the whitened stems of trees, upon a\ndistant prospect made so radiant by its contrast with the shade in\nwhich we sat and made so precious by the arched perspective through\nwhich we saw it that it was like a glimpse of the better land. Upon\nthe Saturday we sat here, Mr. Jarndyce, Ada, and I, until we heard\nthunder muttering in the distance and felt the large raindrops rattle\nthrough the leaves.\n\nThe weather had been all the week extremely sultry, but the storm\nbroke so suddenly--upon us, at least, in that sheltered spot--that\nbefore we reached the outskirts of the wood the thunder and lightning\nwere frequent and the rain came plunging through the leaves as if\nevery drop were a great leaden bead. As it was not a time for\nstanding among trees, we ran out of the wood, and up and down the\nmoss-grown steps which crossed the plantation-fence like two\nbroad-staved ladders placed back to back, and made for a keeper's\nlodge which was close at hand. We had often noticed the dark beauty\nof this lodge standing in a deep twilight of trees, and how the ivy\nclustered over it, and how there was a steep hollow near, where we\nhad once seen the keeper's dog dive down into the fern as if it were\nwater.\n\nThe lodge was so dark within, now the sky was overcast, that we only\nclearly saw the man who came to the door when we took shelter there\nand put two chairs for Ada and me. The lattice-windows were all\nthrown open, and we sat just within the doorway watching the storm.\nIt was grand to see how the wind awoke, and bent the trees, and drove\nthe rain before it like a cloud of smoke; and to hear the solemn\nthunder and to see the lightning; and while thinking with awe of the\ntremendous powers by which our little lives are encompassed, to\nconsider how beneficent they are and how upon the smallest flower and\nleaf there was already a freshness poured from all this seeming rage\nwhich seemed to make creation new again.\n\n\"Is it not dangerous to sit in so exposed a place?\"\n\n\"Oh, no, Esther dear!\" said Ada quietly.\n\nAda said it to me, but I had not spoken.\n\nThe beating of my heart came back again. I had never heard the voice,\nas I had never seen the face, but it affected me in the same strange\nway. Again, in a moment, there arose before my mind innumerable\npictures of myself.\n\nLady Dedlock had taken shelter in the lodge before our arrival there\nand had come out of the gloom within. She stood behind my chair with\nher hand upon it. I saw her with her hand close to my shoulder when I\nturned my head.\n\n\"I have frightened you?\" she said.\n\nNo. It was not fright. Why should I be frightened!\n\n\"I believe,\" said Lady Dedlock to my guardian, \"I have the pleasure\nof speaking to Mr. Jarndyce.\"\n\n\"Your remembrance does me more honour than I had supposed it would,\nLady Dedlock,\" he returned.\n\n\"I recognized you in church on Sunday. I am sorry that any local\ndisputes of Sir Leicester's--they are not of his seeking, however, I\nbelieve--should render it a matter of some absurd difficulty to show\nyou any attention here.\"\n\n\"I am aware of the circumstances,\" returned my guardian with a smile,\n\"and am sufficiently obliged.\"\n\nShe had given him her hand in an indifferent way that seemed habitual\nto her and spoke in a correspondingly indifferent manner, though in a\nvery pleasant voice. She was as graceful as she was beautiful,\nperfectly self-possessed, and had the air, I thought, of being able\nto attract and interest any one if she had thought it worth her\nwhile. The keeper had brought her a chair on which she sat in the\nmiddle of the porch between us.\n\n\"Is the young gentleman disposed of whom you wrote to Sir Leicester\nabout and whose wishes Sir Leicester was sorry not to have it in his\npower to advance in any way?\" she said over her shoulder to my\nguardian.\n\n\"I hope so,\" said he.\n\nShe seemed to respect him and even to wish to conciliate him. There\nwas something very winning in her haughty manner, and it became more\nfamiliar--I was going to say more easy, but that could hardly be--as\nshe spoke to him over her shoulder.\n\n\"I presume this is your other ward, Miss Clare?\"\n\nHe presented Ada, in form.\n\n\"You will lose the disinterested part of your Don Quixote character,\"\nsaid Lady Dedlock to Mr. Jarndyce over her shoulder again, \"if you\nonly redress the wrongs of beauty like this. But present me,\" and she\nturned full upon me, \"to this young lady too!\"\n\n\"Miss Summerson really is my ward,\" said Mr. Jarndyce. \"I am\nresponsible to no Lord Chancellor in her case.\"\n\n\"Has Miss Summerson lost both her parents?\" said my Lady.\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"She is very fortunate in her guardian.\"\n\nLady Dedlock looked at me, and I looked at her and said I was indeed.\nAll at once she turned from me with a hasty air, almost expressive of\ndispleasure or dislike, and spoke to him over her shoulder again.\n\n\"Ages have passed since we were in the habit of meeting, Mr.\nJarndyce.\"\n\n\"A long time. At least I thought it was a long time, until I saw you\nlast Sunday,\" he returned.\n\n\"What! Even you are a courtier, or think it necessary to become one\nto me!\" she said with some disdain. \"I have achieved that reputation,\nI suppose.\"\n\n\"You have achieved so much, Lady Dedlock,\" said my guardian, \"that\nyou pay some little penalty, I dare say. But none to me.\"\n\n\"So much!\" she repeated, slightly laughing. \"Yes!\"\n\nWith her air of superiority, and power, and fascination, and I know\nnot what, she seemed to regard Ada and me as little more than\nchildren. So, as she slightly laughed and afterwards sat looking at\nthe rain, she was as self-possessed and as free to occupy herself\nwith her own thoughts as if she had been alone.\n\n\"I think you knew my sister when we were abroad together better than\nyou know me?\" she said, looking at him again.\n\n\"Yes, we happened to meet oftener,\" he returned.\n\n\"We went our several ways,\" said Lady Dedlock, \"and had little in\ncommon even before we agreed to differ. It is to be regretted, I\nsuppose, but it could not be helped.\"\n\nLady Dedlock again sat looking at the rain. The storm soon began to\npass upon its way. The shower greatly abated, the lightning ceased,\nthe thunder rolled among the distant hills, and the sun began to\nglisten on the wet leaves and the falling rain. As we sat there,\nsilently, we saw a little pony phaeton coming towards us at a merry\npace.\n\n\"The messenger is coming back, my Lady,\" said the keeper, \"with the\ncarriage.\"\n\nAs it drove up, we saw that there were two people inside. There\nalighted from it, with some cloaks and wrappers, first the\nFrenchwoman whom I had seen in church, and secondly the pretty girl,\nthe Frenchwoman with a defiant confidence, the pretty girl confused\nand hesitating.\n\n\"What now?\" said Lady Dedlock. \"Two!\"\n\n\"I am your maid, my Lady, at the present,\" said the Frenchwoman. \"The\nmessage was for the attendant.\"\n\n\"I was afraid you might mean me, my Lady,\" said the pretty girl.\n\n\"I did mean you, child,\" replied her mistress calmly. \"Put that shawl\non me.\"\n\nShe slightly stooped her shoulders to receive it, and the pretty girl\nlightly dropped it in its place. The Frenchwoman stood unnoticed,\nlooking on with her lips very tightly set.\n\n\"I am sorry,\" said Lady Dedlock to Mr. Jarndyce, \"that we are not\nlikely to renew our former acquaintance. You will allow me to send\nthe carriage back for your two wards. It shall be here directly.\"\n\nBut as he would on no account accept this offer, she took a graceful\nleave of Ada--none of me--and put her hand upon his proffered arm,\nand got into the carriage, which was a little, low, park carriage\nwith a hood.\n\n\"Come in, child,\" she said to the pretty girl; \"I shall want you. Go\non!\"\n\nThe carriage rolled away, and the Frenchwoman, with the wrappers she\nhad brought hanging over her arm, remained standing where she had\nalighted.\n\nI suppose there is nothing pride can so little bear with as pride\nitself, and that she was punished for her imperious manner. Her\nretaliation was the most singular I could have imagined. She remained\nperfectly still until the carriage had turned into the drive, and\nthen, without the least discomposure of countenance, slipped off her\nshoes, left them on the ground, and walked deliberately in the same\ndirection through the wettest of the wet grass.\n\n\"Is that young woman mad?\" said my guardian.\n\n\"Oh, no, sir!\" said the keeper, who, with his wife, was looking after\nher. \"Hortense is not one of that sort. She has as good a head-piece\nas the best. But she's mortal high and passionate--powerful high and\npassionate; and what with having notice to leave, and having others\nput above her, she don't take kindly to it.\"\n\n\"But why should she walk shoeless through all that water?\" said my\nguardian.\n\n\"Why, indeed, sir, unless it is to cool her down!\" said the man.\n\n\"Or unless she fancies it's blood,\" said the woman. \"She'd as soon\nwalk through that as anything else, I think, when her own's up!\"\n\nWe passed not far from the house a few minutes afterwards. Peaceful\nas it had looked when we first saw it, it looked even more so now,\nwith a diamond spray glittering all about it, a light wind blowing,\nthe birds no longer hushed but singing strongly, everything refreshed\nby the late rain, and the little carriage shining at the doorway like\na fairy carriage made of silver. Still, very steadfastly and quietly\nwalking towards it, a peaceful figure too in the landscape, went\nMademoiselle Hortense, shoeless, through the wet grass.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIX\n\nMoving On\n\n\nIt is the long vacation in the regions of Chancery Lane. The good\nships Law and Equity, those teak-built, copper-bottomed,\niron-fastened, brazen-faced, and not by any means fast-sailing\nclippers are laid up in ordinary. The Flying Dutchman, with a crew of\nghostly clients imploring all whom they may encounter to peruse their\npapers, has drifted, for the time being, heaven knows where. The\ncourts are all shut up; the public offices lie in a hot sleep.\nWestminster Hall itself is a shady solitude where nightingales might\nsing, and a tenderer class of suitors than is usually found there,\nwalk.\n\nThe Temple, Chancery Lane, Serjeants' Inn, and Lincoln's Inn even\nunto the Fields are like tidal harbours at low water, where stranded\nproceedings, offices at anchor, idle clerks lounging on lop-sided\nstools that will not recover their perpendicular until the current of\nTerm sets in, lie high and dry upon the ooze of the long vacation.\nOuter doors of chambers are shut up by the score, messages and\nparcels are to be left at the Porter's Lodge by the bushel. A crop of\ngrass would grow in the chinks of the stone pavement outside\nLincoln's Inn Hall, but that the ticket-porters, who have nothing to\ndo beyond sitting in the shade there, with their white aprons over\ntheir heads to keep the flies off, grub it up and eat it\nthoughtfully.\n\nThere is only one judge in town. Even he only comes twice a week to\nsit in chambers. If the country folks of those assize towns on his\ncircuit could see him now! No full-bottomed wig, no red petticoats,\nno fur, no javelin-men, no white wands. Merely a close-shaved\ngentleman in white trousers and a white hat, with sea-bronze on the\njudicial countenance, and a strip of bark peeled by the solar rays\nfrom the judicial nose, who calls in at the shell-fish shop as he\ncomes along and drinks iced ginger-beer!\n\nThe bar of England is scattered over the face of the earth. How\nEngland can get on through four long summer months without its\nbar--which is its acknowledged refuge in adversity and its only\nlegitimate triumph in prosperity--is beside the question; assuredly\nthat shield and buckler of Britannia are not in present wear. The\nlearned gentleman who is always so tremendously indignant at the\nunprecedented outrage committed on the feelings of his client by the\nopposite party that he never seems likely to recover it is doing\ninfinitely better than might be expected in Switzerland. The learned\ngentleman who does the withering business and who blights all\nopponents with his gloomy sarcasm is as merry as a grig at a French\nwatering-place. The learned gentleman who weeps by the pint on the\nsmallest provocation has not shed a tear these six weeks. The very\nlearned gentleman who has cooled the natural heat of his gingery\ncomplexion in pools and fountains of law until he has become great in\nknotty arguments for term-time, when he poses the drowsy bench with\nlegal \"chaff,\" inexplicable to the uninitiated and to most of the\ninitiated too, is roaming, with a characteristic delight in aridity\nand dust, about Constantinople. Other dispersed fragments of the same\ngreat palladium are to be found on the canals of Venice, at the\nsecond cataract of the Nile, in the baths of Germany, and sprinkled\non the sea-sand all over the English coast. Scarcely one is to be\nencountered in the deserted region of Chancery Lane. If such a lonely\nmember of the bar do flit across the waste and come upon a prowling\nsuitor who is unable to leave off haunting the scenes of his anxiety,\nthey frighten one another and retreat into opposite shades.\n\nIt is the hottest long vacation known for many years. All the young\nclerks are madly in love, and according to their various degrees,\npine for bliss with the beloved object, at Margate, Ramsgate, or\nGravesend. All the middle-aged clerks think their families too large.\nAll the unowned dogs who stray into the Inns of Court and pant about\nstaircases and other dry places seeking water give short howls of\naggravation. All the blind men's dogs in the streets draw their\nmasters against pumps or trip them over buckets. A shop with a\nsun-blind, and a watered pavement, and a bowl of gold and silver fish\nin the window, is a sanctuary. Temple Bar gets so hot that it is, to\nthe adjacent Strand and Fleet Street, what a heater is in an urn, and\nkeeps them simmering all night.\n\nThere are offices about the Inns of Court in which a man might be\ncool, if any coolness were worth purchasing at such a price in\ndullness; but the little thoroughfares immediately outside those\nretirements seem to blaze. In Mr. Krook's court, it is so hot that\nthe people turn their houses inside out and sit in chairs upon the\npavement--Mr. Krook included, who there pursues his studies, with his\ncat (who never is too hot) by his side. The Sol's Arms has\ndiscontinued the Harmonic Meetings for the season, and Little Swills\nis engaged at the Pastoral Gardens down the river, where he comes out\nin quite an innocent manner and sings comic ditties of a juvenile\ncomplexion calculated (as the bill says) not to wound the feelings of\nthe most fastidious mind.\n\nOver all the legal neighbourhood there hangs, like some great veil of\nrust or gigantic cobweb, the idleness and pensiveness of the long\nvacation. Mr. Snagsby, law-stationer of Cook's Court, Cursitor\nStreet, is sensible of the influence not only in his mind as a\nsympathetic and contemplative man, but also in his business as a\nlaw-stationer aforesaid. He has more leisure for musing in Staple Inn\nand in the Rolls Yard during the long vacation than at other seasons,\nand he says to the two 'prentices, what a thing it is in such hot\nweather to think that you live in an island with the sea a-rolling\nand a-bowling right round you.\n\nGuster is busy in the little drawing-room on this present afternoon\nin the long vacation, when Mr. and Mrs. Snagsby have it in\ncontemplation to receive company. The expected guests are rather\nselect than numerous, being Mr. and Mrs. Chadband and no more. From\nMr. Chadband's being much given to describe himself, both verbally\nand in writing, as a vessel, he is occasionally mistaken by strangers\nfor a gentleman connected with navigation, but he is, as he expresses\nit, \"in the ministry.\" Mr. Chadband is attached to no particular\ndenomination and is considered by his persecutors to have nothing so\nvery remarkable to say on the greatest of subjects as to render his\nvolunteering, on his own account, at all incumbent on his conscience;\nbut he has his followers, and Mrs. Snagsby is of the number. Mrs.\nSnagsby has but recently taken a passage upward by the vessel,\nChadband; and her attention was attracted to that Bark A 1, when she\nwas something flushed by the hot weather.\n\n\"My little woman,\" says Mr. Snagsby to the sparrows in Staple Inn,\n\"likes to have her religion rather sharp, you see!\"\n\nSo Guster, much impressed by regarding herself for the time as the\nhandmaid of Chadband, whom she knows to be endowed with the gift of\nholding forth for four hours at a stretch, prepares the little\ndrawing-room for tea. All the furniture is shaken and dusted, the\nportraits of Mr. and Mrs. Snagsby are touched up with a wet cloth,\nthe best tea-service is set forth, and there is excellent provision\nmade of dainty new bread, crusty twists, cool fresh butter, thin\nslices of ham, tongue, and German sausage, and delicate little rows\nof anchovies nestling in parsley, not to mention new-laid eggs, to be\nbrought up warm in a napkin, and hot buttered toast. For Chadband is\nrather a consuming vessel--the persecutors say a gorging vessel--and\ncan wield such weapons of the flesh as a knife and fork remarkably\nwell.\n\nMr. Snagsby in his best coat, looking at all the preparations when\nthey are completed and coughing his cough of deference behind his\nhand, says to Mrs. Snagsby, \"At what time did you expect Mr. and Mrs.\nChadband, my love?\"\n\n\"At six,\" says Mrs. Snagsby.\n\nMr. Snagsby observes in a mild and casual way that \"it's gone that.\"\n\n\"Perhaps you'd like to begin without them,\" is Mrs. Snagsby's\nreproachful remark.\n\nMr. Snagsby does look as if he would like it very much, but he says,\nwith his cough of mildness, \"No, my dear, no. I merely named the\ntime.\"\n\n\"What's time,\" says Mrs. Snagsby, \"to eternity?\"\n\n\"Very true, my dear,\" says Mr. Snagsby. \"Only when a person lays in\nvictuals for tea, a person does it with a view--perhaps--more to\ntime. And when a time is named for having tea, it's better to come up\nto it.\"\n\n\"To come up to it!\" Mrs. Snagsby repeats with severity. \"Up to it! As\nif Mr. Chadband was a fighter!\"\n\n\"Not at all, my dear,\" says Mr. Snagsby.\n\nHere, Guster, who had been looking out of the bedroom window, comes\nrustling and scratching down the little staircase like a popular\nghost, and falling flushed into the drawing-room, announces that Mr.\nand Mrs. Chadband have appeared in the court. The bell at the inner\ndoor in the passage immediately thereafter tinkling, she is\nadmonished by Mrs. Snagsby, on pain of instant reconsignment to her\npatron saint, not to omit the ceremony of announcement. Much\ndiscomposed in her nerves (which were previously in the best order)\nby this threat, she so fearfully mutilates that point of state as to\nannounce \"Mr. and Mrs. Cheeseming, least which, Imeantersay,\nwhatsername!\" and retires conscience-stricken from the presence.\n\nMr. Chadband is a large yellow man with a fat smile and a general\nappearance of having a good deal of train oil in his system. Mrs.\nChadband is a stern, severe-looking, silent woman. Mr. Chadband moves\nsoftly and cumbrously, not unlike a bear who has been taught to walk\nupright. He is very much embarrassed about the arms, as if they were\ninconvenient to him and he wanted to grovel, is very much in a\nperspiration about the head, and never speaks without first putting\nup his great hand, as delivering a token to his hearers that he is\ngoing to edify them.\n\n\"My friends,\" says Mr. Chadband, \"peace be on this house! On the\nmaster thereof, on the mistress thereof, on the young maidens, and on\nthe young men! My friends, why do I wish for peace? What is peace? Is\nit war? No. Is it strife? No. Is it lovely, and gentle, and\nbeautiful, and pleasant, and serene, and joyful? Oh, yes! Therefore,\nmy friends, I wish for peace, upon you and upon yours.\"\n\nIn consequence of Mrs. Snagsby looking deeply edified, Mr. Snagsby\nthinks it expedient on the whole to say amen, which is well received.\n\n\"Now, my friends,\" proceeds Mr. Chadband, \"since I am upon this\ntheme--\"\n\nGuster presents herself. Mrs. Snagsby, in a spectral bass voice and\nwithout removing her eyes from Chadband, says with dreadful\ndistinctness, \"Go away!\"\n\n\"Now, my friends,\" says Chadband, \"since I am upon this theme, and in\nmy lowly path improving it--\"\n\nGuster is heard unaccountably to murmur \"one thousing seven hundred\nand eighty-two.\" The spectral voice repeats more solemnly, \"Go away!\"\n\n\"Now, my friends,\" says Mr. Chadband, \"we will inquire in a spirit of\nlove--\"\n\nStill Guster reiterates \"one thousing seven hundred and eighty-two.\"\n\nMr. Chadband, pausing with the resignation of a man accustomed to be\npersecuted and languidly folding up his chin into his fat smile,\nsays, \"Let us hear the maiden! Speak, maiden!\"\n\n\"One thousing seven hundred and eighty-two, if you please, sir. Which\nhe wish to know what the shilling ware for,\" says Guster, breathless.\n\n\"For?\" returns Mrs. Chadband. \"For his fare!\"\n\nGuster replied that \"he insistes on one and eightpence or on\nsummonsizzing the party.\" Mrs. Snagsby and Mrs. Chadband are\nproceeding to grow shrill in indignation when Mr. Chadband quiets the\ntumult by lifting up his hand.\n\n\"My friends,\" says he, \"I remember a duty unfulfilled yesterday. It\nis right that I should be chastened in some penalty. I ought not to\nmurmur. Rachael, pay the eightpence!\"\n\nWhile Mrs. Snagsby, drawing her breath, looks hard at Mr. Snagsby, as\nwho should say, \"You hear this apostle!\" and while Mr. Chadband glows\nwith humility and train oil, Mrs. Chadband pays the money. It is Mr.\nChadband's habit--it is the head and front of his pretensions\nindeed--to keep this sort of debtor and creditor account in the\nsmallest items and to post it publicly on the most trivial occasions.\n\n\"My friends,\" says Chadband, \"eightpence is not much; it might justly\nhave been one and fourpence; it might justly have been half a crown.\nO let us be joyful, joyful! O let us be joyful!\"\n\nWith which remark, which appears from its sound to be an extract in\nverse, Mr. Chadband stalks to the table, and before taking a chair,\nlifts up his admonitory hand.\n\n\"My friends,\" says he, \"what is this which we now behold as being\nspread before us? Refreshment. Do we need refreshment then, my\nfriends? We do. And why do we need refreshment, my friends? Because\nwe are but mortal, because we are but sinful, because we are but of\nthe earth, because we are not of the air. Can we fly, my friends? We\ncannot. Why can we not fly, my friends?\"\n\nMr. Snagsby, presuming on the success of his last point, ventures to\nobserve in a cheerful and rather knowing tone, \"No wings.\" But is\nimmediately frowned down by Mrs. Snagsby.\n\n\"I say, my friends,\" pursues Mr. Chadband, utterly rejecting and\nobliterating Mr. Snagsby's suggestion, \"why can we not fly? Is it\nbecause we are calculated to walk? It is. Could we walk, my friends,\nwithout strength? We could not. What should we do without strength,\nmy friends? Our legs would refuse to bear us, our knees would double\nup, our ankles would turn over, and we should come to the ground.\nThen from whence, my friends, in a human point of view, do we derive\nthe strength that is necessary to our limbs? Is it,\" says Chadband,\nglancing over the table, \"from bread in various forms, from butter\nwhich is churned from the milk which is yielded unto us by the cow,\nfrom the eggs which are laid by the fowl, from ham, from tongue, from\nsausage, and from such like? It is. Then let us partake of the good\nthings which are set before us!\"\n\nThe persecutors denied that there was any particular gift in Mr.\nChadband's piling verbose flights of stairs, one upon another, after\nthis fashion. But this can only be received as a proof of their\ndetermination to persecute, since it must be within everybody's\nexperience that the Chadband style of oratory is widely received and\nmuch admired.\n\nMr. Chadband, however, having concluded for the present, sits down at\nMr. Snagsby's table and lays about him prodigiously. The conversion\nof nutriment of any sort into oil of the quality already mentioned\nappears to be a process so inseparable from the constitution of this\nexemplary vessel that in beginning to eat and drink, he may be\ndescribed as always becoming a kind of considerable oil mills or\nother large factory for the production of that article on a wholesale\nscale. On the present evening of the long vacation, in Cook's Court,\nCursitor Street, he does such a powerful stroke of business that the\nwarehouse appears to be quite full when the works cease.\n\nAt this period of the entertainment, Guster, who has never recovered\nher first failure, but has neglected no possible or impossible means\nof bringing the establishment and herself into contempt--among which\nmay be briefly enumerated her unexpectedly performing clashing\nmilitary music on Mr. Chadband's head with plates, and afterwards\ncrowning that gentleman with muffins--at which period of the\nentertainment, Guster whispers Mr. Snagsby that he is wanted.\n\n\"And being wanted in the--not to put too fine a point upon it--in the\nshop,\" says Mr. Snagsby, rising, \"perhaps this good company will\nexcuse me for half a minute.\"\n\nMr. Snagsby descends and finds the two 'prentices intently\ncontemplating a police constable, who holds a ragged boy by the arm.\n\n\"Why, bless my heart,\" says Mr. Snagsby, \"what's the matter!\"\n\n\"This boy,\" says the constable, \"although he's repeatedly told to,\nwon't move on--\"\n\n\"I'm always a-moving on, sar,\" cries the boy, wiping away his grimy\ntears with his arm. \"I've always been a-moving and a-moving on, ever\nsince I was born. Where can I possibly move to, sir, more nor I do\nmove!\"\n\n\"He won't move on,\" says the constable calmly, with a slight\nprofessional hitch of his neck involving its better settlement in his\nstiff stock, \"although he has been repeatedly cautioned, and\ntherefore I am obliged to take him into custody. He's as obstinate a\nyoung gonoph as I know. He WON'T move on.\"\n\n\"Oh, my eye! Where can I move to!\" cries the boy, clutching quite\ndesperately at his hair and beating his bare feet upon the floor of\nMr. Snagsby's passage.\n\n\"Don't you come none of that or I shall make blessed short work of\nyou!\" says the constable, giving him a passionless shake. \"My\ninstructions are that you are to move on. I have told you so five\nhundred times.\"\n\n\"But where?\" cries the boy.\n\n\"Well! Really, constable, you know,\" says Mr. Snagsby wistfully, and\ncoughing behind his hand his cough of great perplexity and doubt,\n\"really, that does seem a question. Where, you know?\"\n\n\"My instructions don't go to that,\" replies the constable. \"My\ninstructions are that this boy is to move on.\"\n\nDo you hear, Jo? It is nothing to you or to any one else that the\ngreat lights of the parliamentary sky have failed for some few years\nin this business to set you the example of moving on. The one grand\nrecipe remains for you--the profound philosophical prescription--the\nbe-all and the end-all of your strange existence upon earth. Move on!\nYou are by no means to move off, Jo, for the great lights can't at\nall agree about that. Move on!\n\nMr. Snagsby says nothing to this effect, says nothing at all indeed,\nbut coughs his forlornest cough, expressive of no thoroughfare in any\ndirection. By this time Mr. and Mrs. Chadband and Mrs. Snagsby,\nhearing the altercation, have appeared upon the stairs. Guster having\nnever left the end of the passage, the whole household are assembled.\n\n\"The simple question is, sir,\" says the constable, \"whether you know\nthis boy. He says you do.\"\n\nMrs. Snagsby, from her elevation, instantly cries out, \"No he don't!\"\n\n\"My lit-tle woman!\" says Mr. Snagsby, looking up the staircase. \"My\nlove, permit me! Pray have a moment's patience, my dear. I do know\nsomething of this lad, and in what I know of him, I can't say that\nthere's any harm; perhaps on the contrary, constable.\" To whom the\nlaw-stationer relates his Joful and woeful experience, suppressing\nthe half-crown fact.\n\n\"Well!\" says the constable, \"so far, it seems, he had grounds for\nwhat he said. When I took him into custody up in Holborn, he said you\nknew him. Upon that, a young man who was in the crowd said he was\nacquainted with you, and you were a respectable housekeeper, and if\nI'd call and make the inquiry, he'd appear. The young man don't seem\ninclined to keep his word, but--Oh! Here IS the young man!\"\n\nEnter Mr. Guppy, who nods to Mr. Snagsby and touches his hat with the\nchivalry of clerkship to the ladies on the stairs.\n\n\"I was strolling away from the office just now when I found this row\ngoing on,\" says Mr. Guppy to the law-stationer, \"and as your name was\nmentioned, I thought it was right the thing should be looked into.\"\n\n\"It was very good-natured of you, sir,\" says Mr. Snagsby, \"and I am\nobliged to you.\" And Mr. Snagsby again relates his experience, again\nsuppressing the half-crown fact.\n\n\"Now, I know where you live,\" says the constable, then, to Jo. \"You\nlive down in Tom-all-Alone's. That's a nice innocent place to live\nin, ain't it?\"\n\n\"I can't go and live in no nicer place, sir,\" replies Jo. \"They\nwouldn't have nothink to say to me if I wos to go to a nice innocent\nplace fur to live. Who ud go and let a nice innocent lodging to such\na reg'lar one as me!\"\n\n\"You are very poor, ain't you?\" says the constable.\n\n\"Yes, I am indeed, sir, wery poor in gin'ral,\" replies Jo. \"I leave\nyou to judge now! I shook these two half-crowns out of him,\" says the\nconstable, producing them to the company, \"in only putting my hand\nupon him!\"\n\n\"They're wot's left, Mr. Snagsby,\" says Jo, \"out of a sov-ring as wos\ngive me by a lady in a wale as sed she wos a servant and as come to\nmy crossin one night and asked to be showd this 'ere ouse and the\nouse wot him as you giv the writin to died at, and the berrin-ground\nwot he's berrid in. She ses to me she ses 'are you the boy at the\ninkwhich?' she ses. I ses 'yes' I ses. She ses to me she ses 'can you\nshow me all them places?' I ses 'yes I can' I ses. And she ses to me\n'do it' and I dun it and she giv me a sov'ring and hooked it. And I\nan't had much of the sov'ring neither,\" says Jo, with dirty tears,\n\"fur I had to pay five bob, down in Tom-all-Alone's, afore they'd\nsquare it fur to give me change, and then a young man he thieved\nanother five while I was asleep and another boy he thieved ninepence\nand the landlord he stood drains round with a lot more on it.\"\n\n\"You don't expect anybody to believe this, about the lady and the\nsovereign, do you?\" says the constable, eyeing him aside with\nineffable disdain.\n\n\"I don't know as I do, sir,\" replies Jo. \"I don't expect nothink at\nall, sir, much, but that's the true hist'ry on it.\"\n\n\"You see what he is!\" the constable observes to the audience. \"Well,\nMr. Snagsby, if I don't lock him up this time, will you engage for\nhis moving on?\"\n\n\"No!\" cries Mrs. Snagsby from the stairs.\n\n\"My little woman!\" pleads her husband. \"Constable, I have no doubt\nhe'll move on. You know you really must do it,\" says Mr. Snagsby.\n\n\"I'm everyways agreeable, sir,\" says the hapless Jo.\n\n\"Do it, then,\" observes the constable. \"You know what you have got to\ndo. Do it! And recollect you won't get off so easy next time. Catch\nhold of your money. Now, the sooner you're five mile off, the better\nfor all parties.\"\n\nWith this farewell hint and pointing generally to the setting sun as\na likely place to move on to, the constable bids his auditors good\nafternoon and makes the echoes of Cook's Court perform slow music for\nhim as he walks away on the shady side, carrying his iron-bound hat\nin his hand for a little ventilation.\n\nNow, Jo's improbable story concerning the lady and the sovereign has\nawakened more or less the curiosity of all the company. Mr. Guppy,\nwho has an inquiring mind in matters of evidence and who has\nbeen suffering severely from the lassitude of the long vacation,\ntakes that interest in the case that he enters on a regular\ncross-examination of the witness, which is found so interesting by\nthe ladies that Mrs. Snagsby politely invites him to step upstairs\nand drink a cup of tea, if he will excuse the disarranged state of\nthe tea-table, consequent on their previous exertions. Mr. Guppy\nyielding his assent to this proposal, Jo is requested to follow into\nthe drawing-room doorway, where Mr. Guppy takes him in hand as a\nwitness, patting him into this shape, that shape, and the other shape\nlike a butterman dealing with so much butter, and worrying him\naccording to the best models. Nor is the examination unlike many such\nmodel displays, both in respect of its eliciting nothing and of its\nbeing lengthy, for Mr. Guppy is sensible of his talent, and Mrs.\nSnagsby feels not only that it gratifies her inquisitive disposition,\nbut that it lifts her husband's establishment higher up in the law.\nDuring the progress of this keen encounter, the vessel Chadband,\nbeing merely engaged in the oil trade, gets aground and waits to be\nfloated off.\n\n\"Well!\" says Mr. Guppy. \"Either this boy sticks to it like\ncobbler's-wax or there is something out of the common here that beats\nanything that ever came into my way at Kenge and Carboy's.\"\n\nMrs. Chadband whispers Mrs. Snagsby, who exclaims, \"You don't say\nso!\"\n\n\"For years!\" replied Mrs. Chadband.\n\n\"Has known Kenge and Carboy's office for years,\" Mrs. Snagsby\ntriumphantly explains to Mr. Guppy. \"Mrs. Chadband--this gentleman's\nwife--Reverend Mr. Chadband.\"\n\n\"Oh, indeed!\" says Mr. Guppy.\n\n\"Before I married my present husband,\" says Mrs. Chadband.\n\n\"Was you a party in anything, ma'am?\" says Mr. Guppy, transferring\nhis cross-examination.\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"NOT a party in anything, ma'am?\" says Mr. Guppy.\n\nMrs. Chadband shakes her head.\n\n\"Perhaps you were acquainted with somebody who was a party in\nsomething, ma'am?\" says Mr. Guppy, who likes nothing better than to\nmodel his conversation on forensic principles.\n\n\"Not exactly that, either,\" replies Mrs. Chadband, humouring the joke\nwith a hard-favoured smile.\n\n\"Not exactly that, either!\" repeats Mr. Guppy. \"Very good. Pray,\nma'am, was it a lady of your acquaintance who had some transactions\n(we will not at present say what transactions) with Kenge and\nCarboy's office, or was it a gentleman of your acquaintance? Take\ntime, ma'am. We shall come to it presently. Man or woman, ma'am?\"\n\n\"Neither,\" says Mrs. Chadband as before.\n\n\"Oh! A child!\" says Mr. Guppy, throwing on the admiring Mrs. Snagsby\nthe regular acute professional eye which is thrown on British\njurymen. \"Now, ma'am, perhaps you'll have the kindness to tell us\nWHAT child.\"\n\n\"You have got it at last, sir,\" says Mrs. Chadband with another\nhard-favoured smile. \"Well, sir, it was before your time, most\nlikely, judging from your appearance. I was left in charge of a child\nnamed Esther Summerson, who was put out in life by Messrs. Kenge and\nCarboy.\"\n\n\"Miss Summerson, ma'am!\" cries Mr. Guppy, excited.\n\n\"I call her Esther Summerson,\" says Mrs. Chadband with austerity.\n\"There was no Miss-ing of the girl in my time. It was Esther.\n'Esther, do this! Esther, do that!' and she was made to do it.\"\n\n\"My dear ma'am,\" returns Mr. Guppy, moving across the small\napartment, \"the humble individual who now addresses you received that\nyoung lady in London when she first came here from the establishment\nto which you have alluded. Allow me to have the pleasure of taking\nyou by the hand.\"\n\nMr. Chadband, at last seeing his opportunity, makes his accustomed\nsignal and rises with a smoking head, which he dabs with his\npocket-handkerchief. Mrs. Snagsby whispers \"Hush!\"\n\n\"My friends,\" says Chadband, \"we have partaken in moderation\" (which\nwas certainly not the case so far as he was concerned) \"of the\ncomforts which have been provided for us. May this house live upon\nthe fatness of the land; may corn and wine be plentiful therein; may\nit grow, may it thrive, may it prosper, may it advance, may it\nproceed, may it press forward! But, my friends, have we partaken of\nanything else? We have. My friends, of what else have we partaken? Of\nspiritual profit? Yes. From whence have we derived that spiritual\nprofit? My young friend, stand forth!\"\n\nJo, thus apostrophized, gives a slouch backward, and another slouch\nforward, and another slouch to each side, and confronts the eloquent\nChadband with evident doubts of his intentions.\n\n\"My young friend,\" says Chadband, \"you are to us a pearl, you are to\nus a diamond, you are to us a gem, you are to us a jewel. And why, my\nyoung friend?\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" replies Jo. \"I don't know nothink.\"\n\n\"My young friend,\" says Chadband, \"it is because you know nothing\nthat you are to us a gem and jewel. For what are you, my young\nfriend? Are you a beast of the field? No. A bird of the air? No. A\nfish of the sea or river? No. You are a human boy, my young friend. A\nhuman boy. O glorious to be a human boy! And why glorious, my young\nfriend? Because you are capable of receiving the lessons of wisdom,\nbecause you are capable of profiting by this discourse which I now\ndeliver for your good, because you are not a stick, or a staff, or a\nstock, or a stone, or a post, or a pillar.\n\n   O running stream of sparkling joy\n   To be a soaring human boy!\n\nAnd do you cool yourself in that stream now, my young friend? No.\nWhy do you not cool yourself in that stream now? Because you are in a\nstate of darkness, because you are in a state of obscurity, because\nyou are in a state of sinfulness, because you are in a state of\nbondage. My young friend, what is bondage? Let us, in a spirit of\nlove, inquire.\"\n\nAt this threatening stage of the discourse, Jo, who seems to have\nbeen gradually going out of his mind, smears his right arm over his\nface and gives a terrible yawn. Mrs. Snagsby indignantly expresses\nher belief that he is a limb of the arch-fiend.\n\n\"My friends,\" says Mr. Chadband with his persecuted chin folding\nitself into its fat smile again as he looks round, \"it is right that\nI should be humbled, it is right that I should be tried, it is right\nthat I should be mortified, it is right that I should be corrected. I\nstumbled, on Sabbath last, when I thought with pride of my three\nhours' improving. The account is now favourably balanced: my creditor\nhas accepted a composition. O let us be joyful, joyful! O let us be\njoyful!\"\n\nGreat sensation on the part of Mrs. Snagsby.\n\n\"My friends,\" says Chadband, looking round him in conclusion, \"I will\nnot proceed with my young friend now. Will you come to-morrow, my\nyoung friend, and inquire of this good lady where I am to be found to\ndeliver a discourse unto you, and will you come like the thirsty\nswallow upon the next day, and upon the day after that, and upon the\nday after that, and upon many pleasant days, to hear discourses?\"\n(This with a cow-like lightness.)\n\nJo, whose immediate object seems to be to get away on any terms,\ngives a shuffling nod. Mr. Guppy then throws him a penny, and Mrs.\nSnagsby calls to Guster to see him safely out of the house. But\nbefore he goes downstairs, Mr. Snagsby loads him with some broken\nmeats from the table, which he carries away, hugging in his arms.\n\nSo, Mr. Chadband--of whom the persecutors say that it is no wonder he\nshould go on for any length of time uttering such abominable\nnonsense, but that the wonder rather is that he should ever leave\noff, having once the audacity to begin--retires into private life\nuntil he invests a little capital of supper in the oil-trade. Jo\nmoves on, through the long vacation, down to Blackfriars Bridge,\nwhere he finds a baking stony corner wherein to settle to his repast.\n\nAnd there he sits, munching and gnawing, and looking up at the great\ncross on the summit of St. Paul's Cathedral, glittering above a\nred-and-violet-tinted cloud of smoke. From the boy's face one might\nsuppose that sacred emblem to be, in his eyes, the crowning confusion\nof the great, confused city--so golden, so high up, so far out of his\nreach. There he sits, the sun going down, the river running fast, the\ncrowd flowing by him in two streams--everything moving on to some\npurpose and to one end--until he is stirred up and told to \"move on\"\ntoo.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XX\n\nA New Lodger\n\n\nThe long vacation saunters on towards term-time like an idle river\nvery leisurely strolling down a flat country to the sea. Mr. Guppy\nsaunters along with it congenially. He has blunted the blade of his\npenknife and broken the point off by sticking that instrument into\nhis desk in every direction. Not that he bears the desk any ill will,\nbut he must do something, and it must be something of an unexciting\nnature, which will lay neither his physical nor his intellectual\nenergies under too heavy contribution. He finds that nothing agrees\nwith him so well as to make little gyrations on one leg of his stool,\nand stab his desk, and gape.\n\nKenge and Carboy are out of town, and the articled clerk has taken\nout a shooting license and gone down to his father's, and Mr. Guppy's\ntwo fellow-stipendiaries are away on leave. Mr. Guppy and Mr. Richard\nCarstone divide the dignity of the office. But Mr. Carstone is for\nthe time being established in Kenge's room, whereat Mr. Guppy chafes.\nSo exceedingly that he with biting sarcasm informs his mother, in the\nconfidential moments when he sups with her off a lobster and lettuce\nin the Old Street Road, that he is afraid the office is hardly good\nenough for swells, and that if he had known there was a swell coming,\nhe would have got it painted.\n\nMr. Guppy suspects everybody who enters on the occupation of a stool\nin Kenge and Carboy's office of entertaining, as a matter of course,\nsinister designs upon him. He is clear that every such person wants\nto depose him. If he be ever asked how, why, when, or wherefore, he\nshuts up one eye and shakes his head. On the strength of these\nprofound views, he in the most ingenious manner takes infinite pains\nto counterplot when there is no plot, and plays the deepest games of\nchess without any adversary.\n\nIt is a source of much gratification to Mr. Guppy, therefore, to find\nthe new-comer constantly poring over the papers in Jarndyce and\nJarndyce, for he well knows that nothing but confusion and failure\ncan come of that. His satisfaction communicates itself to a third\nsaunterer through the long vacation in Kenge and Carboy's office, to\nwit, Young Smallweed.\n\nWhether Young Smallweed (metaphorically called Small and eke Chick\nWeed, as it were jocularly to express a fledgling) was ever a boy is\nmuch doubted in Lincoln's Inn. He is now something under fifteen and\nan old limb of the law. He is facetiously understood to entertain a\npassion for a lady at a cigar-shop in the neighbourhood of Chancery\nLane and for her sake to have broken off a contract with another\nlady, to whom he had been engaged some years. He is a town-made\narticle, of small stature and weazen features, but may be perceived\nfrom a considerable distance by means of his very tall hat. To become\na Guppy is the object of his ambition. He dresses at that gentleman\n(by whom he is patronized), talks at him, walks at him, founds\nhimself entirely on him. He is honoured with Mr. Guppy's particular\nconfidence and occasionally advises him, from the deep wells of his\nexperience, on difficult points in private life.\n\nMr. Guppy has been lolling out of window all the morning after trying\nall the stools in succession and finding none of them easy, and after\nseveral times putting his head into the iron safe with a notion of\ncooling it. Mr. Smallweed has been twice dispatched for effervescent\ndrinks, and has twice mixed them in the two official tumblers and\nstirred them up with the ruler. Mr. Guppy propounds for Mr.\nSmallweed's consideration the paradox that the more you drink the\nthirstier you are and reclines his head upon the window-sill in a\nstate of hopeless languor.\n\nWhile thus looking out into the shade of Old Square, Lincoln's Inn,\nsurveying the intolerable bricks and mortar, Mr. Guppy becomes\nconscious of a manly whisker emerging from the cloistered walk below\nand turning itself up in the direction of his face. At the same time,\na low whistle is wafted through the Inn and a suppressed voice cries,\n\"Hip! Gup-py!\"\n\n\"Why, you don't mean it!\" says Mr. Guppy, aroused. \"Small! Here's\nJobling!\" Small's head looks out of window too and nods to Jobling.\n\n\"Where have you sprung up from?\" inquires Mr. Guppy.\n\n\"From the market-gardens down by Deptford. I can't stand it any\nlonger. I must enlist. I say! I wish you'd lend me half a crown. Upon\nmy soul, I'm hungry.\"\n\nJobling looks hungry and also has the appearance of having run to\nseed in the market-gardens down by Deptford.\n\n\"I say! Just throw out half a crown if you have got one to spare. I\nwant to get some dinner.\"\n\n\"Will you come and dine with me?\" says Mr. Guppy, throwing out the\ncoin, which Mr. Jobling catches neatly.\n\n\"How long should I have to hold out?\" says Jobling.\n\n\"Not half an hour. I am only waiting here till the enemy goes,\nreturns Mr. Guppy, butting inward with his head.\n\n\"What enemy?\"\n\n\"A new one. Going to be articled. Will you wait?\"\n\n\"Can you give a fellow anything to read in the meantime?\" says Mr.\nJobling.\n\nSmallweed suggests the law list. But Mr. Jobling declares with much\nearnestness that he \"can't stand it.\"\n\n\"You shall have the paper,\" says Mr. Guppy. \"He shall bring it down.\nBut you had better not be seen about here. Sit on our staircase and\nread. It's a quiet place.\"\n\nJobling nods intelligence and acquiescence. The sagacious Smallweed\nsupplies him with the newspaper and occasionally drops his eye upon\nhim from the landing as a precaution against his becoming disgusted\nwith waiting and making an untimely departure. At last the enemy\nretreats, and then Smallweed fetches Mr. Jobling up.\n\n\"Well, and how are you?\" says Mr. Guppy, shaking hands with him.\n\n\"So, so. How are you?\"\n\nMr. Guppy replying that he is not much to boast of, Mr. Jobling\nventures on the question, \"How is SHE?\" This Mr. Guppy resents as a\nliberty, retorting, \"Jobling, there ARE chords in the human mind--\"\nJobling begs pardon.\n\n\"Any subject but that!\" says Mr. Guppy with a gloomy enjoyment of his\ninjury. \"For there ARE chords, Jobling--\"\n\nMr. Jobling begs pardon again.\n\nDuring this short colloquy, the active Smallweed, who is of the\ndinner party, has written in legal characters on a slip of paper,\n\"Return immediately.\" This notification to all whom it may concern,\nhe inserts in the letter-box, and then putting on the tall hat at the\nangle of inclination at which Mr. Guppy wears his, informs his patron\nthat they may now make themselves scarce.\n\nAccordingly they betake themselves to a neighbouring dining-house, of\nthe class known among its frequenters by the denomination slap-bang,\nwhere the waitress, a bouncing young female of forty, is supposed to\nhave made some impression on the susceptible Smallweed, of whom it\nmay be remarked that he is a weird changeling to whom years are\nnothing. He stands precociously possessed of centuries of owlish\nwisdom. If he ever lay in a cradle, it seems as if he must have lain\nthere in a tail-coat. He has an old, old eye, has Smallweed; and he\ndrinks and smokes in a monkeyish way; and his neck is stiff in his\ncollar; and he is never to be taken in; and he knows all about it,\nwhatever it is. In short, in his bringing up he has been so nursed by\nLaw and Equity that he has become a kind of fossil imp, to account\nfor whose terrestrial existence it is reported at the public offices\nthat his father was John Doe and his mother the only female member of\nthe Roe family, also that his first long-clothes were made from a\nblue bag.\n\nInto the dining-house, unaffected by the seductive show in the window\nof artificially whitened cauliflowers and poultry, verdant baskets of\npeas, coolly blooming cucumbers, and joints ready for the spit, Mr.\nSmallweed leads the way. They know him there and defer to him. He has\nhis favourite box, he bespeaks all the papers, he is down upon bald\npatriarchs, who keep them more than ten minutes afterwards. It is of\nno use trying him with anything less than a full-sized \"bread\" or\nproposing to him any joint in cut unless it is in the very best cut.\nIn the matter of gravy he is adamant.\n\nConscious of his elfin power and submitting to his dread experience,\nMr. Guppy consults him in the choice of that day's banquet, turning\nan appealing look towards him as the waitress repeats the catalogue\nof viands and saying \"What do YOU take, Chick?\" Chick, out of the\nprofundity of his artfulness, preferring \"veal and ham and French\nbeans--and don't you forget the stuffing, Polly\" (with an unearthly\ncock of his venerable eye), Mr. Guppy and Mr. Jobling give the like\norder. Three pint pots of half-and-half are superadded. Quickly the\nwaitress returns bearing what is apparently a model of the Tower of\nBabel but what is really a pile of plates and flat tin dish-covers.\nMr. Smallweed, approving of what is set before him, conveys\nintelligent benignity into his ancient eye and winks upon her. Then,\namid a constant coming in, and going out, and running about, and a\nclatter of crockery, and a rumbling up and down of the machine which\nbrings the nice cuts from the kitchen, and a shrill crying for more\nnice cuts down the speaking-pipe, and a shrill reckoning of the cost\nof nice cuts that have been disposed of, and a general flush and\nsteam of hot joints, cut and uncut, and a considerably heated\natmosphere in which the soiled knives and tablecloths seem to break\nout spontaneously into eruptions of grease and blotches of beer, the\nlegal triumvirate appease their appetites.\n\nMr. Jobling is buttoned up closer than mere adornment might require.\nHis hat presents at the rims a peculiar appearance of a glistening\nnature, as if it had been a favourite snail-promenade. The same\nphenomenon is visible on some parts of his coat, and particularly at\nthe seams. He has the faded appearance of a gentleman in embarrassed\ncircumstances; even his light whiskers droop with something of a\nshabby air.\n\nHis appetite is so vigorous that it suggests spare living for some\nlittle time back. He makes such a speedy end of his plate of veal and\nham, bringing it to a close while his companions are yet midway in\ntheirs, that Mr. Guppy proposes another. \"Thank you, Guppy,\" says Mr.\nJobling, \"I really don't know but what I WILL take another.\"\n\nAnother being brought, he falls to with great goodwill.\n\nMr. Guppy takes silent notice of him at intervals until he is half\nway through this second plate and stops to take an enjoying pull at\nhis pint pot of half-and-half (also renewed) and stretches out his\nlegs and rubs his hands. Beholding him in which glow of contentment,\nMr. Guppy says, \"You are a man again, Tony!\"\n\n\"Well, not quite yet,\" says Mr. Jobling. \"Say, just born.\"\n\n\"Will you take any other vegetables? Grass? Peas? Summer cabbage?\"\n\n\"Thank you, Guppy,\" says Mr. Jobling. \"I really don't know but what I\nWILL take summer cabbage.\"\n\nOrder given; with the sarcastic addition (from Mr. Smallweed) of\n\"Without slugs, Polly!\" And cabbage produced.\n\n\"I am growing up, Guppy,\" says Mr. Jobling, plying his knife and fork\nwith a relishing steadiness.\n\n\"Glad to hear it.\"\n\n\"In fact, I have just turned into my teens,\" says Mr. Jobling.\n\nHe says no more until he has performed his task, which he achieves as\nMessrs. Guppy and Smallweed finish theirs, thus getting over the\nground in excellent style and beating those two gentlemen easily by a\nveal and ham and a cabbage.\n\n\"Now, Small,\" says Mr. Guppy, \"what would you recommend about\npastry?\"\n\n\"Marrow puddings,\" says Mr. Smallweed instantly.\n\n\"Aye, aye!\" cries Mr. Jobling with an arch look. \"You're there, are\nyou? Thank you, Mr. Guppy, I don't know but what I WILL take a marrow\npudding.\"\n\nThree marrow puddings being produced, Mr. Jobling adds in a pleasant\nhumour that he is coming of age fast. To these succeed, by command of\nMr. Smallweed, \"three Cheshires,\" and to those \"three small rums.\"\nThis apex of the entertainment happily reached, Mr. Jobling puts up\nhis legs on the carpeted seat (having his own side of the box to\nhimself), leans against the wall, and says, \"I am grown up now,\nGuppy. I have arrived at maturity.\"\n\n\"What do you think, now,\" says Mr. Guppy, \"about--you don't mind\nSmallweed?\"\n\n\"Not the least in the world. I have the pleasure of drinking his good\nhealth.\"\n\n\"Sir, to you!\" says Mr. Smallweed.\n\n\"I was saying, what do you think NOW,\" pursues Mr. Guppy, \"of\nenlisting?\"\n\n\"Why, what I may think after dinner,\" returns Mr. Jobling, \"is one\nthing, my dear Guppy, and what I may think before dinner is another\nthing. Still, even after dinner, I ask myself the question, What am I\nto do? How am I to live? Ill fo manger, you know,\" says Mr. Jobling,\npronouncing that word as if he meant a necessary fixture in an\nEnglish stable. \"Ill fo manger. That's the French saying, and\nmangering is as necessary to me as it is to a Frenchman. Or more so.\"\n\nMr. Smallweed is decidedly of opinion \"much more so.\"\n\n\"If any man had told me,\" pursues Jobling, \"even so lately as when\nyou and I had the frisk down in Lincolnshire, Guppy, and drove over\nto see that house at Castle Wold--\"\n\nMr. Smallweed corrects him--Chesney Wold.\n\n\"Chesney Wold. (I thank my honourable friend for that cheer.) If any\nman had told me then that I should be as hard up at the present time\nas I literally find myself, I should have--well, I should have\npitched into him,\" says Mr. Jobling, taking a little rum-and-water\nwith an air of desperate resignation; \"I should have let fly at his\nhead.\"\n\n\"Still, Tony, you were on the wrong side of the post then,\"\nremonstrates Mr. Guppy. \"You were talking about nothing else in the\ngig.\"\n\n\"Guppy,\" says Mr. Jobling, \"I will not deny it. I was on the wrong\nside of the post. But I trusted to things coming round.\"\n\nThat very popular trust in flat things coming round! Not in their\nbeing beaten round, or worked round, but in their \"coming\" round! As\nthough a lunatic should trust in the world's \"coming\" triangular!\n\n\"I had confident expectations that things would come round and be all\nsquare,\" says Mr. Jobling with some vagueness of expression and\nperhaps of meaning too. \"But I was disappointed. They never did. And\nwhen it came to creditors making rows at the office and to people\nthat the office dealt with making complaints about dirty trifles of\nborrowed money, why there was an end of that connexion. And of any\nnew professional connexion too, for if I was to give a reference\nto-morrow, it would be mentioned and would sew me up. Then what's a\nfellow to do? I have been keeping out of the way and living cheap\ndown about the market-gardens, but what's the use of living cheap\nwhen you have got no money? You might as well live dear.\"\n\n\"Better,\" Mr. Smallweed thinks.\n\n\"Certainly. It's the fashionable way; and fashion and whiskers have\nbeen my weaknesses, and I don't care who knows it,\" says Mr. Jobling.\n\"They are great weaknesses--Damme, sir, they are great. Well,\"\nproceeds Mr. Jobling after a defiant visit to his rum-and-water,\n\"what can a fellow do, I ask you, BUT enlist?\"\n\nMr. Guppy comes more fully into the conversation to state what, in\nhis opinion, a fellow can do. His manner is the gravely impressive\nmanner of a man who has not committed himself in life otherwise than\nas he has become the victim of a tender sorrow of the heart.\n\n\"Jobling,\" says Mr. Guppy, \"myself and our mutual friend Smallweed--\"\n\nMr. Smallweed modestly observes, \"Gentlemen both!\" and drinks.\n\n\"--Have had a little conversation on this matter more than once since\nyou--\"\n\n\"Say, got the sack!\" cries Mr. Jobling bitterly. \"Say it, Guppy. You\nmean it.\"\n\n\"No-o-o! Left the Inn,\" Mr. Smallweed delicately suggests.\n\n\"Since you left the Inn, Jobling,\" says Mr. Guppy; \"and I have\nmentioned to our mutual friend Smallweed a plan I have lately thought\nof proposing. You know Snagsby the stationer?\"\n\n\"I know there is such a stationer,\" returns Mr. Jobling. \"He was not\nours, and I am not acquainted with him.\"\n\n\"He IS ours, Jobling, and I AM acquainted with him,\" Mr. Guppy\nretorts. \"Well, sir! I have lately become better acquainted with him\nthrough some accidental circumstances that have made me a visitor of\nhis in private life. Those circumstances it is not necessary to offer\nin argument. They may--or they may not--have some reference to a\nsubject which may--or may not--have cast its shadow on my existence.\"\n\nAs it is Mr. Guppy's perplexing way with boastful misery to tempt his\nparticular friends into this subject, and the moment they touch it,\nto turn on them with that trenchant severity about the chords in the\nhuman mind, both Mr. Jobling and Mr. Smallweed decline the pitfall by\nremaining silent.\n\n\"Such things may be,\" repeats Mr. Guppy, \"or they may not be. They\nare no part of the case. It is enough to mention that both Mr. and\nMrs. Snagsby are very willing to oblige me and that Snagsby has, in\nbusy times, a good deal of copying work to give out. He has all\nTulkinghorn's, and an excellent business besides. I believe if our\nmutual friend Smallweed were put into the box, he could prove this?\"\n\nMr. Smallweed nods and appears greedy to be sworn.\n\n\"Now, gentlemen of the jury,\" says Mr. Guppy, \"--I mean, now,\nJobling--you may say this is a poor prospect of a living. Granted.\nBut it's better than nothing, and better than enlistment. You want\ntime. There must be time for these late affairs to blow over. You\nmight live through it on much worse terms than by writing for\nSnagsby.\"\n\nMr. Jobling is about to interrupt when the sagacious Smallweed checks\nhim with a dry cough and the words, \"Hem! Shakspeare!\"\n\n\"There are two branches to this subject, Jobling,\" says Mr. Guppy.\n\"That is the first. I come to the second. You know Krook, the\nChancellor, across the lane. Come, Jobling,\" says Mr. Guppy in his\nencouraging cross-examination-tone, \"I think you know Krook, the\nChancellor, across the lane?\"\n\n\"I know him by sight,\" says Mr. Jobling.\n\n\"You know him by sight. Very well. And you know little Flite?\"\n\n\"Everybody knows her,\" says Mr. Jobling.\n\n\"Everybody knows her. VERY well. Now it has been one of my duties of\nlate to pay Flite a certain weekly allowance, deducting from it the\namount of her weekly rent, which I have paid (in consequence of\ninstructions I have received) to Krook himself, regularly in her\npresence. This has brought me into communication with Krook and into\na knowledge of his house and his habits. I know he has a room to let.\nYou may live there at a very low charge under any name you like, as\nquietly as if you were a hundred miles off. He'll ask no questions\nand would accept you as a tenant at a word from me--before the clock\nstrikes, if you chose. And I tell you another thing, Jobling,\" says\nMr. Guppy, who has suddenly lowered his voice and become familiar\nagain, \"he's an extraordinary old chap--always rummaging among a\nlitter of papers and grubbing away at teaching himself to read and\nwrite, without getting on a bit, as it seems to me. He is a most\nextraordinary old chap, sir. I don't know but what it might be worth\na fellow's while to look him up a bit.\"\n\n\"You don't mean--\" Mr. Jobling begins.\n\n\"I mean,\" returns Mr. Guppy, shrugging his shoulders with becoming\nmodesty, \"that I can't make him out. I appeal to our mutual friend\nSmallweed whether he has or has not heard me remark that I can't make\nhim out.\"\n\nMr. Smallweed bears the concise testimony, \"A few!\"\n\n\"I have seen something of the profession and something of life,\nTony,\" says Mr. Guppy, \"and it's seldom I can't make a man out, more\nor less. But such an old card as this, so deep, so sly, and secret\n(though I don't believe he is ever sober), I never came across. Now,\nhe must be precious old, you know, and he has not a soul about him,\nand he is reported to be immensely rich; and whether he is a\nsmuggler, or a receiver, or an unlicensed pawnbroker, or a\nmoney-lender--all of which I have thought likely at different\ntimes--it might pay you to knock up a sort of knowledge of him. I\ndon't see why you shouldn't go in for it, when everything else\nsuits.\"\n\nMr. Jobling, Mr. Guppy, and Mr. Smallweed all lean their elbows on\nthe table and their chins upon their hands, and look at the ceiling.\nAfter a time, they all drink, slowly lean back, put their hands in\ntheir pockets, and look at one another.\n\n\"If I had the energy I once possessed, Tony!\" says Mr. Guppy with a\nsigh. \"But there are chords in the human mind--\"\n\nExpressing the remainder of the desolate sentiment in rum-and-water,\nMr. Guppy concludes by resigning the adventure to Tony Jobling and\ninforming him that during the vacation and while things are slack,\nhis purse, \"as far as three or four or even five pound goes,\" will be\nat his disposal. \"For never shall it be said,\" Mr. Guppy adds with\nemphasis, \"that William Guppy turned his back upon his friend!\"\n\nThe latter part of the proposal is so directly to the purpose that\nMr. Jobling says with emotion, \"Guppy, my trump, your fist!\" Mr.\nGuppy presents it, saying, \"Jobling, my boy, there it is!\" Mr.\nJobling returns, \"Guppy, we have been pals now for some years!\" Mr.\nGuppy replies, \"Jobling, we have.\"\n\nThey then shake hands, and Mr. Jobling adds in a feeling manner,\n\"Thank you, Guppy, I don't know but what I WILL take another glass\nfor old acquaintance sake.\"\n\n\"Krook's last lodger died there,\" observes Mr. Guppy in an incidental\nway.\n\n\"Did he though!\" says Mr. Jobling.\n\n\"There was a verdict. Accidental death. You don't mind that?\"\n\n\"No,\" says Mr. Jobling, \"I don't mind it; but he might as well have\ndied somewhere else. It's devilish odd that he need go and die at MY\nplace!\" Mr. Jobling quite resents this liberty, several times\nreturning to it with such remarks as, \"There are places enough to die\nin, I should think!\" or, \"He wouldn't have liked my dying at HIS\nplace, I dare say!\"\n\nHowever, the compact being virtually made, Mr. Guppy proposes to\ndispatch the trusty Smallweed to ascertain if Mr. Krook is at home,\nas in that case they may complete the negotiation without delay. Mr.\nJobling approving, Smallweed puts himself under the tall hat and\nconveys it out of the dining-rooms in the Guppy manner. He soon\nreturns with the intelligence that Mr. Krook is at home and that he\nhas seen him through the shop-door, sitting in the back premises,\nsleeping \"like one o'clock.\"\n\n\"Then I'll pay,\" says Mr. Guppy, \"and we'll go and see him. Small,\nwhat will it be?\"\n\nMr. Smallweed, compelling the attendance of the waitress with one\nhitch of his eyelash, instantly replies as follows: \"Four veals and\nhams is three, and four potatoes is three and four, and one summer\ncabbage is three and six, and three marrows is four and six, and six\nbreads is five, and three Cheshires is five and three, and four\nhalf-pints of half-and-half is six and three, and four small rums is\neight and three, and three Pollys is eight and six. Eight and six in\nhalf a sovereign, Polly, and eighteenpence out!\"\n\nNot at all excited by these stupendous calculations, Smallweed\ndismisses his friends with a cool nod and remains behind to take a\nlittle admiring notice of Polly, as opportunity may serve, and to\nread the daily papers, which are so very large in proportion to\nhimself, shorn of his hat, that when he holds up the Times to run his\neye over the columns, he seems to have retired for the night and to\nhave disappeared under the bedclothes.\n\nMr. Guppy and Mr. Jobling repair to the rag and bottle shop, where\nthey find Krook still sleeping like one o'clock, that is to say,\nbreathing stertorously with his chin upon his breast and quite\ninsensible to any external sounds or even to gentle shaking. On the\ntable beside him, among the usual lumber, stand an empty gin-bottle\nand a glass. The unwholesome air is so stained with this liquor that\neven the green eyes of the cat upon her shelf, as they open and shut\nand glimmer on the visitors, look drunk.\n\n\"Hold up here!\" says Mr. Guppy, giving the relaxed figure of the old\nman another shake. \"Mr. Krook! Halloa, sir!\"\n\nBut it would seem as easy to wake a bundle of old clothes with a\nspirituous heat smouldering in it. \"Did you ever see such a stupor as\nhe falls into, between drink and sleep?\" says Mr. Guppy.\n\n\"If this is his regular sleep,\" returns Jobling, rather alarmed,\n\"it'll last a long time one of these days, I am thinking.\"\n\n\"It's always more like a fit than a nap,\" says Mr. Guppy, shaking him\nagain. \"Halloa, your lordship! Why, he might be robbed fifty times\nover! Open your eyes!\"\n\nAfter much ado, he opens them, but without appearing to see his\nvisitors or any other objects. Though he crosses one leg on another,\nand folds his hands, and several times closes and opens his parched\nlips, he seems to all intents and purposes as insensible as before.\n\n\"He is alive, at any rate,\" says Mr. Guppy. \"How are you, my Lord\nChancellor. I have brought a friend of mine, sir, on a little matter\nof business.\"\n\nThe old man still sits, often smacking his dry lips without the least\nconsciousness. After some minutes he makes an attempt to rise. They\nhelp him up, and he staggers against the wall and stares at them.\n\n\"How do you do, Mr. Krook?\" says Mr. Guppy in some discomfiture. \"How\ndo you do, sir? You are looking charming, Mr. Krook. I hope you are\npretty well?\"\n\nThe old man, in aiming a purposeless blow at Mr. Guppy, or at\nnothing, feebly swings himself round and comes with his face against\nthe wall. So he remains for a minute or two, heaped up against it,\nand then staggers down the shop to the front door. The air, the\nmovement in the court, the lapse of time, or the combination of these\nthings recovers him. He comes back pretty steadily, adjusting his fur\ncap on his head and looking keenly at them.\n\n\"Your servant, gentlemen; I've been dozing. Hi! I am hard to wake,\nodd times.\"\n\n\"Rather so, indeed, sir,\" responds Mr. Guppy.\n\n\"What? You've been a-trying to do it, have you?\" says the suspicious\nKrook.\n\n\"Only a little,\" Mr. Guppy explains.\n\nThe old man's eye resting on the empty bottle, he takes it up,\nexamines it, and slowly tilts it upside down.\n\n\"I say!\" he cries like the hobgoblin in the story. \"Somebody's been\nmaking free here!\"\n\n\"I assure you we found it so,\" says Mr. Guppy. \"Would you allow me to\nget it filled for you?\"\n\n\"Yes, certainly I would!\" cries Krook in high glee. \"Certainly I\nwould! Don't mention it! Get it filled next door--Sol's Arms--the\nLord Chancellor's fourteenpenny. Bless you, they know ME!\"\n\nHe so presses the empty bottle upon Mr. Guppy that that gentleman,\nwith a nod to his friend, accepts the trust and hurries out and\nhurries in again with the bottle filled. The old man receives it in\nhis arms like a beloved grandchild and pats it tenderly.\n\n\"But, I say,\" he whispers, with his eyes screwed up, after tasting\nit, \"this ain't the Lord Chancellor's fourteenpenny. This is\neighteenpenny!\"\n\n\"I thought you might like that better,\" says Mr. Guppy.\n\n\"You're a nobleman, sir,\" returns Krook with another taste, and his\nhot breath seems to come towards them like a flame. \"You're a baron\nof the land.\"\n\nTaking advantage of this auspicious moment, Mr. Guppy presents his\nfriend under the impromptu name of Mr. Weevle and states the object\nof their visit. Krook, with his bottle under his arm (he never gets\nbeyond a certain point of either drunkenness or sobriety), takes time\nto survey his proposed lodger and seems to approve of him. \"You'd\nlike to see the room, young man?\" he says. \"Ah! It's a good room!\nBeen whitewashed. Been cleaned down with soft soap and soda. Hi! It's\nworth twice the rent, letting alone my company when you want it and\nsuch a cat to keep the mice away.\"\n\nCommending the room after this manner, the old man takes them\nupstairs, where indeed they do find it cleaner than it used to be and\nalso containing some old articles of furniture which he has dug up\nfrom his inexhaustible stores. The terms are easily concluded--for\nthe Lord Chancellor cannot be hard on Mr. Guppy, associated as he is\nwith Kenge and Carboy, Jarndyce and Jarndyce, and other famous claims\non his professional consideration--and it is agreed that Mr. Weevle\nshall take possession on the morrow. Mr. Weevle and Mr. Guppy then\nrepair to Cook's Court, Cursitor Street, where the personal\nintroduction of the former to Mr. Snagsby is effected and (more\nimportant) the vote and interest of Mrs. Snagsby are secured. They\nthen report progress to the eminent Smallweed, waiting at the office\nin his tall hat for that purpose, and separate, Mr. Guppy explaining\nthat he would terminate his little entertainment by standing treat at\nthe play but that there are chords in the human mind which would\nrender it a hollow mockery.\n\nOn the morrow, in the dusk of evening, Mr. Weevle modestly appears at\nKrook's, by no means incommoded with luggage, and establishes himself\nin his new lodging, where the two eyes in the shutters stare at him\nin his sleep, as if they were full of wonder. On the following day\nMr. Weevle, who is a handy good-for-nothing kind of young fellow,\nborrows a needle and thread of Miss Flite and a hammer of his\nlandlord and goes to work devising apologies for window-curtains, and\nknocking up apologies for shelves, and hanging up his two teacups,\nmilkpot, and crockery sundries on a pennyworth of little hooks, like\na shipwrecked sailor making the best of it.\n\nBut what Mr. Weevle prizes most of all his few possessions (next\nafter his light whiskers, for which he has an attachment that only\nwhiskers can awaken in the breast of man) is a choice collection of\ncopper-plate impressions from that truly national work The Divinities\nof Albion, or Galaxy Gallery of British Beauty, representing ladies\nof title and fashion in every variety of smirk that art, combined\nwith capital, is capable of producing. With these magnificent\nportraits, unworthily confined in a band-box during his seclusion\namong the market-gardens, he decorates his apartment; and as the\nGalaxy Gallery of British Beauty wears every variety of fancy dress,\nplays every variety of musical instrument, fondles every variety of\ndog, ogles every variety of prospect, and is backed up by every\nvariety of flower-pot and balustrade, the result is very imposing.\n\nBut fashion is Mr. Weevle's, as it was Tony Jobling's, weakness. To\nborrow yesterday's paper from the Sol's Arms of an evening and read\nabout the brilliant and distinguished meteors that are shooting\nacross the fashionable sky in every direction is unspeakable\nconsolation to him. To know what member of what brilliant and\ndistinguished circle accomplished the brilliant and distinguished\nfeat of joining it yesterday or contemplates the no less brilliant\nand distinguished feat of leaving it to-morrow gives him a thrill of\njoy. To be informed what the Galaxy Gallery of British Beauty is\nabout, and means to be about, and what Galaxy marriages are on the\ntapis, and what Galaxy rumours are in circulation, is to become\nacquainted with the most glorious destinies of mankind. Mr. Weevle\nreverts from this intelligence to the Galaxy portraits implicated,\nand seems to know the originals, and to be known of them.\n\nFor the rest he is a quiet lodger, full of handy shifts and devices\nas before mentioned, able to cook and clean for himself as well as to\ncarpenter, and developing social inclinations after the shades of\nevening have fallen on the court. At those times, when he is not\nvisited by Mr. Guppy or by a small light in his likeness quenched in\na dark hat, he comes out of his dull room--where he has inherited the\ndeal wilderness of desk bespattered with a rain of ink--and talks to\nKrook or is \"very free,\" as they call it in the court, commendingly,\nwith any one disposed for conversation. Wherefore, Mrs. Piper, who\nleads the court, is impelled to offer two remarks to Mrs. Perkins:\nfirstly, that if her Johnny was to have whiskers, she could wish 'em\nto be identically like that young man's; and secondly, \"Mark my\nwords, Mrs. Perkins, ma'am, and don't you be surprised, Lord bless\nyou, if that young man comes in at last for old Krook's money!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXI\n\nThe Smallweed Family\n\n\nIn a rather ill-favoured and ill-savoured neighbourhood, though one\nof its rising grounds bears the name of Mount Pleasant, the Elfin\nSmallweed, christened Bartholomew and known on the domestic hearth as\nBart, passes that limited portion of his time on which the office and\nits contingencies have no claim. He dwells in a little narrow street,\nalways solitary, shady, and sad, closely bricked in on all sides like\na tomb, but where there yet lingers the stump of an old forest tree\nwhose flavour is about as fresh and natural as the Smallweed smack of\nyouth.\n\nThere has been only one child in the Smallweed family for several\ngenerations. Little old men and women there have been, but no child,\nuntil Mr. Smallweed's grandmother, now living, became weak in her\nintellect and fell (for the first time) into a childish state. With\nsuch infantine graces as a total want of observation, memory,\nunderstanding, and interest, and an eternal disposition to fall\nasleep over the fire and into it, Mr. Smallweed's grandmother has\nundoubtedly brightened the family.\n\nMr. Smallweed's grandfather is likewise of the party. He is in a\nhelpless condition as to his lower, and nearly so as to his upper,\nlimbs, but his mind is unimpaired. It holds, as well as it ever held,\nthe first four rules of arithmetic and a certain small collection of\nthe hardest facts. In respect of ideality, reverence, wonder, and\nother such phrenological attributes, it is no worse off than it used\nto be. Everything that Mr. Smallweed's grandfather ever put away in\nhis mind was a grub at first, and is a grub at last. In all his life\nhe has never bred a single butterfly.\n\nThe father of this pleasant grandfather, of the neighbourhood of\nMount Pleasant, was a horny-skinned, two-legged, money-getting\nspecies of spider who spun webs to catch unwary flies and retired\ninto holes until they were entrapped. The name of this old pagan's\ngod was Compound Interest. He lived for it, married it, died of it.\nMeeting with a heavy loss in an honest little enterprise in which all\nthe loss was intended to have been on the other side, he broke\nsomething--something necessary to his existence, therefore it\ncouldn't have been his heart--and made an end of his career. As his\ncharacter was not good, and he had been bred at a charity school in a\ncomplete course, according to question and answer, of those ancient\npeople the Amorites and Hittites, he was frequently quoted as an\nexample of the failure of education.\n\nHis spirit shone through his son, to whom he had always preached of\n\"going out\" early in life and whom he made a clerk in a sharp\nscrivener's office at twelve years old. There the young gentleman\nimproved his mind, which was of a lean and anxious character, and\ndeveloping the family gifts, gradually elevated himself into the\ndiscounting profession. Going out early in life and marrying late, as\nhis father had done before him, he too begat a lean and\nanxious-minded son, who in his turn, going out early in life and\nmarrying late, became the father of Bartholomew and Judith Smallweed,\ntwins. During the whole time consumed in the slow growth of this\nfamily tree, the house of Smallweed, always early to go out and late\nto marry, has strengthened itself in its practical character, has\ndiscarded all amusements, discountenanced all story-books,\nfairy-tales, fictions, and fables, and banished all levities\nwhatsoever. Hence the gratifying fact that it has had no child born\nto it and that the complete little men and women whom it has produced\nhave been observed to bear a likeness to old monkeys with something\ndepressing on their minds.\n\nAt the present time, in the dark little parlour certain feet below\nthe level of the street--a grim, hard, uncouth parlour, only\nornamented with the coarsest of baize table-covers, and the hardest\nof sheet-iron tea-trays, and offering in its decorative character no\nbad allegorical representation of Grandfather Smallweed's\nmind--seated in two black horsehair porter's chairs, one on each side\nof the fire-place, the superannuated Mr. and Mrs. Smallweed while\naway the rosy hours. On the stove are a couple of trivets for the\npots and kettles which it is Grandfather Smallweed's usual occupation\nto watch, and projecting from the chimney-piece between them is a\nsort of brass gallows for roasting, which he also superintends when\nit is in action. Under the venerable Mr. Smallweed's seat and guarded\nby his spindle legs is a drawer in his chair, reported to contain\nproperty to a fabulous amount. Beside him is a spare cushion with\nwhich he is always provided in order that he may have something to\nthrow at the venerable partner of his respected age whenever she\nmakes an allusion to money--a subject on which he is particularly\nsensitive.\n\n\"And where's Bart?\" Grandfather Smallweed inquires of Judy, Bart's\ntwin sister.\n\n\"He an't come in yet,\" says Judy.\n\n\"It's his tea-time, isn't it?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"How much do you mean to say it wants then?\"\n\n\"Ten minutes.\"\n\n\"Hey?\"\n\n\"Ten minutes.\" (Loud on the part of Judy.)\n\n\"Ho!\" says Grandfather Smallweed. \"Ten minutes.\"\n\nGrandmother Smallweed, who has been mumbling and shaking her head at\nthe trivets, hearing figures mentioned, connects them with money and\nscreeches like a horrible old parrot without any plumage, \"Ten\nten-pound notes!\"\n\nGrandfather Smallweed immediately throws the cushion at her.\n\n\"Drat you, be quiet!\" says the good old man.\n\nThe effect of this act of jaculation is twofold. It not only doubles\nup Mrs. Smallweed's head against the side of her porter's chair and\ncauses her to present, when extricated by her granddaughter, a highly\nunbecoming state of cap, but the necessary exertion recoils on Mr.\nSmallweed himself, whom it throws back into HIS porter's chair like a\nbroken puppet. The excellent old gentleman being at these times a\nmere clothes-bag with a black skull-cap on the top of it, does not\npresent a very animated appearance until he has undergone the two\noperations at the hands of his granddaughter of being shaken up like\na great bottle and poked and punched like a great bolster. Some\nindication of a neck being developed in him by these means, he and\nthe sharer of his life's evening again fronting one another in their\ntwo porter's chairs, like a couple of sentinels long forgotten on\ntheir post by the Black Serjeant, Death.\n\nJudy the twin is worthy company for these associates. She is so\nindubitably sister to Mr. Smallweed the younger that the two kneaded\ninto one would hardly make a young person of average proportions,\nwhile she so happily exemplifies the before-mentioned family likeness\nto the monkey tribe that attired in a spangled robe and cap she might\nwalk about the table-land on the top of a barrel-organ without\nexciting much remark as an unusual specimen. Under existing\ncircumstances, however, she is dressed in a plain, spare gown of\nbrown stuff.\n\nJudy never owned a doll, never heard of Cinderella, never played at\nany game. She once or twice fell into children's company when she was\nabout ten years old, but the children couldn't get on with Judy, and\nJudy couldn't get on with them. She seemed like an animal of another\nspecies, and there was instinctive repugnance on both sides. It is\nvery doubtful whether Judy knows how to laugh. She has so rarely seen\nthe thing done that the probabilities are strong the other way. Of\nanything like a youthful laugh, she certainly can have no conception.\nIf she were to try one, she would find her teeth in her way,\nmodelling that action of her face, as she has unconsciously modelled\nall its other expressions, on her pattern of sordid age. Such is\nJudy.\n\nAnd her twin brother couldn't wind up a top for his life. He knows no\nmore of Jack the Giant Killer or of Sinbad the Sailor than he knows\nof the people in the stars. He could as soon play at leap-frog or at\ncricket as change into a cricket or a frog himself. But he is so much\nthe better off than his sister that on his narrow world of fact an\nopening has dawned into such broader regions as lie within the ken of\nMr. Guppy. Hence his admiration and his emulation of that shining\nenchanter.\n\nJudy, with a gong-like clash and clatter, sets one of the sheet-iron\ntea-trays on the table and arranges cups and saucers. The bread she\nputs on in an iron basket, and the butter (and not much of it) in a\nsmall pewter plate. Grandfather Smallweed looks hard after the tea as\nit is served out and asks Judy where the girl is.\n\n\"Charley, do you mean?\" says Judy.\n\n\"Hey?\" from Grandfather Smallweed.\n\n\"Charley, do you mean?\"\n\nThis touches a spring in Grandmother Smallweed, who, chuckling as\nusual at the trivets, cries, \"Over the water! Charley over the water,\nCharley over the water, over the water to Charley, Charley over the\nwater, over the water to Charley!\" and becomes quite energetic about\nit. Grandfather looks at the cushion but has not sufficiently\nrecovered his late exertion.\n\n\"Ha!\" he says when there is silence. \"If that's her name. She eats a\ndeal. It would be better to allow her for her keep.\"\n\nJudy, with her brother's wink, shakes her head and purses up her\nmouth into no without saying it.\n\n\"No?\" returns the old man. \"Why not?\"\n\n\"She'd want sixpence a day, and we can do it for less,\" says Judy.\n\n\"Sure?\"\n\nJudy answers with a nod of deepest meaning and calls, as she scrapes\nthe butter on the loaf with every precaution against waste and cuts\nit into slices, \"You, Charley, where are you?\" Timidly obedient to\nthe summons, a little girl in a rough apron and a large bonnet, with\nher hands covered with soap and water and a scrubbing brush in one of\nthem, appears, and curtsys.\n\n\"What work are you about now?\" says Judy, making an ancient snap at\nher like a very sharp old beldame.\n\n\"I'm a-cleaning the upstairs back room, miss,\" replies Charley.\n\n\"Mind you do it thoroughly, and don't loiter. Shirking won't do for\nme. Make haste! Go along!\" cries Judy with a stamp upon the ground.\n\"You girls are more trouble than you're worth, by half.\"\n\nOn this severe matron, as she returns to her task of scraping the\nbutter and cutting the bread, falls the shadow of her brother,\nlooking in at the window. For whom, knife and loaf in hand, she opens\nthe street-door.\n\n\"Aye, aye, Bart!\" says Grandfather Smallweed. \"Here you are, hey?\"\n\n\"Here I am,\" says Bart.\n\n\"Been along with your friend again, Bart?\"\n\nSmall nods.\n\n\"Dining at his expense, Bart?\"\n\nSmall nods again.\n\n\"That's right. Live at his expense as much as you can, and take\nwarning by his foolish example. That's the use of such a friend. The\nonly use you can put him to,\" says the venerable sage.\n\nHis grandson, without receiving this good counsel as dutifully as he\nmight, honours it with all such acceptance as may lie in a slight\nwink and a nod and takes a chair at the tea-table. The four old faces\nthen hover over teacups like a company of ghastly cherubim, Mrs.\nSmallweed perpetually twitching her head and chattering at the\ntrivets and Mr. Smallweed requiring to be repeatedly shaken up like a\nlarge black draught.\n\n\"Yes, yes,\" says the good old gentleman, reverting to his lesson of\nwisdom. \"That's such advice as your father would have given you,\nBart. You never saw your father. More's the pity. He was my true\nson.\" Whether it is intended to be conveyed that he was particularly\npleasant to look at, on that account, does not appear.\n\n\"He was my true son,\" repeats the old gentleman, folding his bread\nand butter on his knee, \"a good accountant, and died fifteen years\nago.\"\n\nMrs. Smallweed, following her usual instinct, breaks out with\n\"Fifteen hundred pound. Fifteen hundred pound in a black box, fifteen\nhundred pound locked up, fifteen hundred pound put away and hid!\" Her\nworthy husband, setting aside his bread and butter, immediately\ndischarges the cushion at her, crushes her against the side of her\nchair, and falls back in his own, overpowered. His appearance, after\nvisiting Mrs. Smallweed with one of these admonitions, is\nparticularly impressive and not wholly prepossessing, firstly because\nthe exertion generally twists his black skull-cap over one eye and\ngives him an air of goblin rakishness, secondly because he mutters\nviolent imprecations against Mrs. Smallweed, and thirdly because the\ncontrast between those powerful expressions and his powerless figure\nis suggestive of a baleful old malignant who would be very wicked if\nhe could. All this, however, is so common in the Smallweed family\ncircle that it produces no impression. The old gentleman is merely\nshaken and has his internal feathers beaten up, the cushion is\nrestored to its usual place beside him, and the old lady, perhaps\nwith her cap adjusted and perhaps not, is planted in her chair again,\nready to be bowled down like a ninepin.\n\nSome time elapses in the present instance before the old gentleman is\nsufficiently cool to resume his discourse, and even then he mixes it\nup with several edifying expletives addressed to the unconscious\npartner of his bosom, who holds communication with nothing on earth\nbut the trivets. As thus: \"If your father, Bart, had lived longer, he\nmight have been worth a deal of money--you brimstone chatterer!--but\njust as he was beginning to build up the house that he had been\nmaking the foundations for, through many a year--you jade of a\nmagpie, jackdaw, and poll-parrot, what do you mean!--he took ill and\ndied of a low fever, always being a sparing and a spare man, full of\nbusiness care--I should like to throw a cat at you instead of a\ncushion, and I will too if you make such a confounded fool of\nyourself!--and your mother, who was a prudent woman as dry as a chip,\njust dwindled away like touchwood after you and Judy were born--you\nare an old pig. You are a brimstone pig. You're a head of swine!\"\n\nJudy, not interested in what she has often heard, begins to collect\nin a basin various tributary streams of tea, from the bottoms of cups\nand saucers and from the bottom of the tea-pot for the little\ncharwoman's evening meal. In like manner she gets together, in the\niron bread-basket, as many outside fragments and worn-down heels of\nloaves as the rigid economy of the house has left in existence.\n\n\"But your father and me were partners, Bart,\" says the old gentleman,\n\"and when I am gone, you and Judy will have all there is. It's rare\nfor you both that you went out early in life--Judy to the flower\nbusiness, and you to the law. You won't want to spend it. You'll get\nyour living without it, and put more to it. When I am gone, Judy will\ngo back to the flower business and you'll still stick to the law.\"\n\nOne might infer from Judy's appearance that her business rather lay\nwith the thorns than the flowers, but she has in her time been\napprenticed to the art and mystery of artificial flower-making. A\nclose observer might perhaps detect both in her eye and her\nbrother's, when their venerable grandsire anticipates his being gone,\nsome little impatience to know when he may be going, and some\nresentful opinion that it is time he went.\n\n\"Now, if everybody has done,\" says Judy, completing her preparations,\n\"I'll have that girl in to her tea. She would never leave off if she\ntook it by herself in the kitchen.\"\n\nCharley is accordingly introduced, and under a heavy fire of eyes,\nsits down to her basin and a Druidical ruin of bread and butter. In\nthe active superintendence of this young person, Judy Smallweed\nappears to attain a perfectly geological age and to date from the\nremotest periods. Her systematic manner of flying at her and pouncing\non her, with or without pretence, whether or no, is wonderful,\nevincing an accomplishment in the art of girl-driving seldom reached\nby the oldest practitioners.\n\n\"Now, don't stare about you all the afternoon,\" cries Judy, shaking\nher head and stamping her foot as she happens to catch the glance\nwhich has been previously sounding the basin of tea, \"but take your\nvictuals and get back to your work.\"\n\n\"Yes, miss,\" says Charley.\n\n\"Don't say yes,\" returns Miss Smallweed, \"for I know what you girls\nare. Do it without saying it, and then I may begin to believe you.\"\n\nCharley swallows a great gulp of tea in token of submission and so\ndisperses the Druidical ruins that Miss Smallweed charges her not to\ngormandize, which \"in you girls,\" she observes, is disgusting.\nCharley might find some more difficulty in meeting her views on the\ngeneral subject of girls but for a knock at the door.\n\n\"See who it is, and don't chew when you open it!\" cries Judy.\n\nThe object of her attentions withdrawing for the purpose, Miss\nSmallweed takes that opportunity of jumbling the remainder of the\nbread and butter together and launching two or three dirty tea-cups\ninto the ebb-tide of the basin of tea as a hint that she considers\nthe eating and drinking terminated.\n\n\"Now! Who is it, and what's wanted?\" says the snappish Judy.\n\nIt is one Mr. George, it appears. Without other announcement or\nceremony, Mr. George walks in.\n\n\"Whew!\" says Mr. George. \"You are hot here. Always a fire, eh? Well!\nPerhaps you do right to get used to one.\" Mr. George makes the latter\nremark to himself as he nods to Grandfather Smallweed.\n\n\"Ho! It's you!\" cries the old gentleman. \"How de do? How de do?\"\n\n\"Middling,\" replies Mr. George, taking a chair. \"Your granddaughter I\nhave had the honour of seeing before; my service to you, miss.\"\n\n\"This is my grandson,\" says Grandfather Smallweed. \"You ha'n't seen\nhim before. He is in the law and not much at home.\"\n\n\"My service to him, too! He is like his sister. He is very like his\nsister. He is devilish like his sister,\" says Mr. George, laying a\ngreat and not altogether complimentary stress on his last adjective.\n\n\"And how does the world use you, Mr. George?\" Grandfather Smallweed\ninquires, slowly rubbing his legs.\n\n\"Pretty much as usual. Like a football.\"\n\nHe is a swarthy brown man of fifty, well made, and good looking, with\ncrisp dark hair, bright eyes, and a broad chest. His sinewy and\npowerful hands, as sunburnt as his face, have evidently been used to\na pretty rough life. What is curious about him is that he sits\nforward on his chair as if he were, from long habit, allowing space\nfor some dress or accoutrements that he has altogether laid aside.\nHis step too is measured and heavy and would go well with a weighty\nclash and jingle of spurs. He is close-shaved now, but his mouth is\nset as if his upper lip had been for years familiar with a great\nmoustache; and his manner of occasionally laying the open palm of his\nbroad brown hand upon it is to the same effect. Altogether one might\nguess Mr. George to have been a trooper once upon a time.\n\nA special contrast Mr. George makes to the Smallweed family. Trooper\nwas never yet billeted upon a household more unlike him. It is a\nbroadsword to an oyster-knife. His developed figure and their stunted\nforms, his large manner filling any amount of room and their little\nnarrow pinched ways, his sounding voice and their sharp spare tones,\nare in the strongest and the strangest opposition. As he sits in the\nmiddle of the grim parlour, leaning a little forward, with his hands\nupon his thighs and his elbows squared, he looks as though, if he\nremained there long, he would absorb into himself the whole family\nand the whole four-roomed house, extra little back-kitchen and all.\n\n\"Do you rub your legs to rub life into 'em?\" he asks of Grandfather\nSmallweed after looking round the room.\n\n\"Why, it's partly a habit, Mr. George, and--yes--it partly helps the\ncirculation,\" he replies.\n\n\"The cir-cu-la-tion!\" repeats Mr. George, folding his arms upon his\nchest and seeming to become two sizes larger. \"Not much of that, I\nshould think.\"\n\n\"Truly I'm old, Mr. George,\" says Grandfather Smallweed. \"But I can\ncarry my years. I'm older than HER,\" nodding at his wife, \"and see\nwhat she is? You're a brimstone chatterer!\" with a sudden revival of\nhis late hostility.\n\n\"Unlucky old soul!\" says Mr. George, turning his head in that\ndirection. \"Don't scold the old lady. Look at her here, with her poor\ncap half off her head and her poor hair all in a muddle. Hold up,\nma'am. That's better. There we are! Think of your mother, Mr.\nSmallweed,\" says Mr. George, coming back to his seat from assisting\nher, \"if your wife an't enough.\"\n\n\"I suppose you were an excellent son, Mr. George?\" the old man hints\nwith a leer.\n\nThe colour of Mr. George's face rather deepens as he replies, \"Why\nno. I wasn't.\"\n\n\"I am astonished at it.\"\n\n\"So am I. I ought to have been a good son, and I think I meant to\nhave been one. But I wasn't. I was a thundering bad son, that's the\nlong and the short of it, and never was a credit to anybody.\"\n\n\"Surprising!\" cries the old man.\n\n\"However,\" Mr. George resumes, \"the less said about it, the better\nnow. Come! You know the agreement. Always a pipe out of the two\nmonths' interest! (Bosh! It's all correct. You needn't be afraid to\norder the pipe. Here's the new bill, and here's the two months'\ninterest-money, and a devil-and-all of a scrape it is to get it\ntogether in my business.)\"\n\nMr. George sits, with his arms folded, consuming the family and the\nparlour while Grandfather Smallweed is assisted by Judy to two black\nleathern cases out of a locked bureau, in one of which he secures the\ndocument he has just received, and from the other takes another\nsimilar document which he hands to Mr. George, who twists it up for a\npipelight. As the old man inspects, through his glasses, every\nup-stroke and down-stroke of both documents before he releases them\nfrom their leathern prison, and as he counts the money three times\nover and requires Judy to say every word she utters at least twice,\nand is as tremulously slow of speech and action as it is possible to\nbe, this business is a long time in progress. When it is quite\nconcluded, and not before, he disengages his ravenous eyes and\nfingers from it and answers Mr. George's last remark by saying,\n\"Afraid to order the pipe? We are not so mercenary as that, sir.\nJudy, see directly to the pipe and the glass of cold brandy-and-water\nfor Mr. George.\"\n\nThe sportive twins, who have been looking straight before them all\nthis time except when they have been engrossed by the black leathern\ncases, retire together, generally disdainful of the visitor, but\nleaving him to the old man as two young cubs might leave a traveller\nto the parental bear.\n\n\"And there you sit, I suppose, all the day long, eh?\" says Mr. George\nwith folded arms.\n\n\"Just so, just so,\" the old man nods.\n\n\"And don't you occupy yourself at all?\"\n\n\"I watch the fire--and the boiling and the roasting--\"\n\n\"When there is any,\" says Mr. George with great expression.\n\n\"Just so. When there is any.\"\n\n\"Don't you read or get read to?\"\n\nThe old man shakes his head with sharp sly triumph. \"No, no. We have\nnever been readers in our family. It don't pay. Stuff. Idleness.\nFolly. No, no!\"\n\n\"There's not much to choose between your two states,\" says the\nvisitor in a key too low for the old man's dull hearing as he looks\nfrom him to the old woman and back again. \"I say!\" in a louder voice.\n\n\"I hear you.\"\n\n\"You'll sell me up at last, I suppose, when I am a day in arrear.\"\n\n\"My dear friend!\" cries Grandfather Smallweed, stretching out both\nhands to embrace him. \"Never! Never, my dear friend! But my friend in\nthe city that I got to lend you the money--HE might!\"\n\n\"Oh! You can't answer for him?\" says Mr. George, finishing the\ninquiry in his lower key with the words \"You lying old rascal!\"\n\n\"My dear friend, he is not to be depended on. I wouldn't trust him.\nHe will have his bond, my dear friend.\"\n\n\"Devil doubt him,\" says Mr. George. Charley appearing with a\ntray, on which are the pipe, a small paper of tobacco, and the\nbrandy-and-water, he asks her, \"How do you come here! You haven't got\nthe family face.\"\n\n\"I goes out to work, sir,\" returns Charley.\n\nThe trooper (if trooper he be or have been) takes her bonnet off,\nwith a light touch for so strong a hand, and pats her on the head.\n\"You give the house almost a wholesome look. It wants a bit of youth\nas much as it wants fresh air.\" Then he dismisses her, lights his\npipe, and drinks to Mr. Smallweed's friend in the city--the one\nsolitary flight of that esteemed old gentleman's imagination.\n\n\"So you think he might be hard upon me, eh?\"\n\n\"I think he might--I am afraid he would. I have known him do it,\"\nsays Grandfather Smallweed incautiously, \"twenty times.\"\n\nIncautiously, because his stricken better-half, who has been dozing\nover the fire for some time, is instantly aroused and jabbers \"Twenty\nthousand pounds, twenty twenty-pound notes in a money-box, twenty\nguineas, twenty million twenty per cent, twenty--\" and is then cut\nshort by the flying cushion, which the visitor, to whom this singular\nexperiment appears to be a novelty, snatches from her face as it\ncrushes her in the usual manner.\n\n\"You're a brimstone idiot. You're a scorpion--a brimstone scorpion!\nYou're a sweltering toad. You're a chattering clattering broomstick\nwitch that ought to be burnt!\" gasps the old man, prostrate in his\nchair. \"My dear friend, will you shake me up a little?\"\n\nMr. George, who has been looking first at one of them and then at the\nother, as if he were demented, takes his venerable acquaintance by\nthe throat on receiving this request, and dragging him upright in his\nchair as easily as if he were a doll, appears in two minds whether or\nno to shake all future power of cushioning out of him and shake him\ninto his grave. Resisting the temptation, but agitating him violently\nenough to make his head roll like a harlequin's, he puts him smartly\ndown in his chair again and adjusts his skull-cap with such a rub\nthat the old man winks with both eyes for a minute afterwards.\n\n\"O Lord!\" gasps Mr. Smallweed. \"That'll do. Thank you, my dear\nfriend, that'll do. Oh, dear me, I'm out of breath. O Lord!\" And Mr.\nSmallweed says it not without evident apprehensions of his dear\nfriend, who still stands over him looming larger than ever.\n\nThe alarming presence, however, gradually subsides into its chair and\nfalls to smoking in long puffs, consoling itself with the\nphilosophical reflection, \"The name of your friend in the city begins\nwith a D, comrade, and you're about right respecting the bond.\"\n\n\"Did you speak, Mr. George?\" inquires the old man.\n\nThe trooper shakes his head, and leaning forward with his right elbow\non his right knee and his pipe supported in that hand, while his\nother hand, resting on his left leg, squares his left elbow in a\nmartial manner, continues to smoke. Meanwhile he looks at Mr.\nSmallweed with grave attention and now and then fans the cloud of\nsmoke away in order that he may see him the more clearly.\n\n\"I take it,\" he says, making just as much and as little change in his\nposition as will enable him to reach the glass to his lips with a\nround, full action, \"that I am the only man alive (or dead either)\nthat gets the value of a pipe out of YOU?\"\n\n\"Well,\" returns the old man, \"it's true that I don't see company, Mr.\nGeorge, and that I don't treat. I can't afford to it. But as you, in\nyour pleasant way, made your pipe a condition--\"\n\n\"Why, it's not for the value of it; that's no great thing. It was a\nfancy to get it out of you. To have something in for my money.\"\n\n\"Ha! You're prudent, prudent, sir!\" cries Grandfather Smallweed,\nrubbing his legs.\n\n\"Very. I always was.\" Puff. \"It's a sure sign of my prudence that I\never found the way here.\" Puff. \"Also, that I am what I am.\" Puff. \"I\nam well known to be prudent,\" says Mr. George, composedly smoking. \"I\nrose in life that way.\"\n\n\"Don't be down-hearted, sir. You may rise yet.\"\n\nMr. George laughs and drinks.\n\n\"Ha'n't you no relations, now,\" asks Grandfather Smallweed with a\ntwinkle in his eyes, \"who would pay off this little principal or who\nwould lend you a good name or two that I could persuade my friend in\nthe city to make you a further advance upon? Two good names would be\nsufficient for my friend in the city. Ha'n't you no such relations,\nMr. George?\"\n\nMr. George, still composedly smoking, replies, \"If I had, I shouldn't\ntrouble them. I have been trouble enough to my belongings in my day.\nIt MAY be a very good sort of penitence in a vagabond, who has wasted\nthe best time of his life, to go back then to decent people that he\nnever was a credit to and live upon them, but it's not my sort. The\nbest kind of amends then for having gone away is to keep away, in my\nopinion.\"\n\n\"But natural affection, Mr. George,\" hints Grandfather Smallweed.\n\n\"For two good names, hey?\" says Mr. George, shaking his head and\nstill composedly smoking. \"No. That's not my sort either.\"\n\nGrandfather Smallweed has been gradually sliding down in his chair\nsince his last adjustment and is now a bundle of clothes with a voice\nin it calling for Judy. That houri, appearing, shakes him up in the\nusual manner and is charged by the old gentleman to remain near him.\nFor he seems chary of putting his visitor to the trouble of repeating\nhis late attentions.\n\n\"Ha!\" he observes when he is in trim again. \"If you could have traced\nout the captain, Mr. George, it would have been the making of you. If\nwhen you first came here, in consequence of our advertisement in the\nnewspapers--when I say 'our,' I'm alluding to the advertisements of\nmy friend in the city, and one or two others who embark their capital\nin the same way, and are so friendly towards me as sometimes to give\nme a lift with my little pittance--if at that time you could have\nhelped us, Mr. George, it would have been the making of you.\"\n\n\"I was willing enough to be 'made,' as you call it,\" says Mr. George,\nsmoking not quite so placidly as before, for since the entrance of\nJudy he has been in some measure disturbed by a fascination, not of\nthe admiring kind, which obliges him to look at her as she stands by\nher grandfather's chair, \"but on the whole, I am glad I wasn't now.\"\n\n\"Why, Mr. George? In the name of--of brimstone, why?\" says\nGrandfather Smallweed with a plain appearance of exasperation.\n(Brimstone apparently suggested by his eye lighting on Mrs. Smallweed\nin her slumber.)\n\n\"For two reasons, comrade.\"\n\n\"And what two reasons, Mr. George? In the name of the--\"\n\n\"Of our friend in the city?\" suggests Mr. George, composedly\ndrinking.\n\n\"Aye, if you like. What two reasons?\"\n\n\"In the first place,\" returns Mr. George, but still looking at Judy\nas if she being so old and so like her grandfather it is indifferent\nwhich of the two he addresses, \"you gentlemen took me in. You\nadvertised that Mr. Hawdon (Captain Hawdon, if you hold to the saying\n'Once a captain, always a captain') was to hear of something to his\nadvantage.\"\n\n\"Well?\" returns the old man shrilly and sharply.\n\n\"Well!\" says Mr. George, smoking on. \"It wouldn't have been much to\nhis advantage to have been clapped into prison by the whole bill and\njudgment trade of London.\"\n\n\"How do you know that? Some of his rich relations might have paid his\ndebts or compounded for 'em. Besides, he had taken US in. He owed us\nimmense sums all round. I would sooner have strangled him than had no\nreturn. If I sit here thinking of him,\" snarls the old man, holding\nup his impotent ten fingers, \"I want to strangle him now.\" And in a\nsudden access of fury, he throws the cushion at the unoffending Mrs.\nSmallweed, but it passes harmlessly on one side of her chair.\n\n\"I don't need to be told,\" returns the trooper, taking his pipe from\nhis lips for a moment and carrying his eyes back from following the\nprogress of the cushion to the pipe-bowl which is burning low, \"that\nhe carried on heavily and went to ruin. I have been at his right hand\nmany a day when he was charging upon ruin full-gallop. I was with him\nwhen he was sick and well, rich and poor. I laid this hand upon him\nafter he had run through everything and broken down everything\nbeneath him--when he held a pistol to his head.\"\n\n\"I wish he had let it off,\" says the benevolent old man, \"and blown\nhis head into as many pieces as he owed pounds!\"\n\n\"That would have been a smash indeed,\" returns the trooper coolly;\n\"any way, he had been young, hopeful, and handsome in the days gone\nby, and I am glad I never found him, when he was neither, to lead to\na result so much to his advantage. That's reason number one.\"\n\n\"I hope number two's as good?\" snarls the old man.\n\n\"Why, no. It's more of a selfish reason. If I had found him, I must\nhave gone to the other world to look. He was there.\"\n\n\"How do you know he was there?\"\n\n\"He wasn't here.\"\n\n\"How do you know he wasn't here?\"\n\n\"Don't lose your temper as well as your money,\" says Mr. George,\ncalmly knocking the ashes out of his pipe. \"He was drowned long\nbefore. I am convinced of it. He went over a ship's side. Whether\nintentionally or accidentally, I don't know. Perhaps your friend in\nthe city does. Do you know what that tune is, Mr. Smallweed?\" he adds\nafter breaking off to whistle one, accompanied on the table with the\nempty pipe.\n\n\"Tune!\" replied the old man. \"No. We never have tunes here.\"\n\n\"That's the Dead March in Saul. They bury soldiers to it,\nso it's the natural end of the subject. Now, if your pretty\ngranddaughter--excuse me, miss--will condescend to take care of this\npipe for two months, we shall save the cost of one next time. Good\nevening, Mr. Smallweed!\"\n\n\"My dear friend!\" the old man gives him both his hands.\n\n\"So you think your friend in the city will be hard upon me if I fall\nin a payment?\" says the trooper, looking down upon him like a giant.\n\n\"My dear friend, I am afraid he will,\" returns the old man, looking\nup at him like a pygmy.\n\nMr. George laughs, and with a glance at Mr. Smallweed and a parting\nsalutation to the scornful Judy, strides out of the parlour, clashing\nimaginary sabres and other metallic appurtenances as he goes.\n\n\"You're a damned rogue,\" says the old gentleman, making a hideous\ngrimace at the door as he shuts it. \"But I'll lime you, you dog, I'll\nlime you!\"\n\nAfter this amiable remark, his spirit soars into those enchanting\nregions of reflection which its education and pursuits have opened to\nit, and again he and Mrs. Smallweed while away the rosy hours, two\nunrelieved sentinels forgotten as aforesaid by the Black Serjeant.\n\nWhile the twain are faithful to their post, Mr. George strides\nthrough the streets with a massive kind of swagger and a grave-enough\nface. It is eight o'clock now, and the day is fast drawing in. He\nstops hard by Waterloo Bridge and reads a playbill, decides to go to\nAstley's Theatre. Being there, is much delighted with the horses and\nthe feats of strength; looks at the weapons with a critical eye;\ndisapproves of the combats as giving evidences of unskilful\nswordsmanship; but is touched home by the sentiments. In the last\nscene, when the Emperor of Tartary gets up into a cart and\ncondescends to bless the united lovers by hovering over them with the\nUnion Jack, his eyelashes are moistened with emotion.\n\nThe theatre over, Mr. George comes across the water again and makes\nhis way to that curious region lying about the Haymarket and\nLeicester Square which is a centre of attraction to indifferent\nforeign hotels and indifferent foreigners, racket-courts,\nfighting-men, swordsmen, footguards, old china, gaming-houses,\nexhibitions, and a large medley of shabbiness and shrinking out of\nsight. Penetrating to the heart of this region, he arrives by a court\nand a long whitewashed passage at a great brick building composed of\nbare walls, floors, roof-rafters, and skylights, on the front of\nwhich, if it can be said to have any front, is painted GEORGE'S\nSHOOTING GALLERY, &c.\n\nInto George's Shooting Gallery, &c., he goes; and in it there are\ngaslights (partly turned off now), and two whitened targets for\nrifle-shooting, and archery accommodation, and fencing appliances,\nand all necessaries for the British art of boxing. None of these\nsports or exercises being pursued in George's Shooting Gallery\nto-night, which is so devoid of company that a little grotesque man\nwith a large head has it all to himself and lies asleep upon the\nfloor.\n\nThe little man is dressed something like a gunsmith, in a green-baize\napron and cap; and his face and hands are dirty with gunpowder and\nbegrimed with the loading of guns. As he lies in the light before a\nglaring white target, the black upon him shines again. Not far off is\nthe strong, rough, primitive table with a vice upon it at which he\nhas been working. He is a little man with a face all crushed\ntogether, who appears, from a certain blue and speckled appearance\nthat one of his cheeks presents, to have been blown up, in the way of\nbusiness, at some odd time or times.\n\n\"Phil!\" says the trooper in a quiet voice.\n\n\"All right!\" cries Phil, scrambling to his feet.\n\n\"Anything been doing?\"\n\n\"Flat as ever so much swipes,\" says Phil. \"Five dozen rifle and a\ndozen pistol. As to aim!\" Phil gives a howl at the recollection.\n\n\"Shut up shop, Phil!\"\n\nAs Phil moves about to execute this order, it appears that he is\nlame, though able to move very quickly. On the speckled side of his\nface he has no eyebrow, and on the other side he has a bushy black\none, which want of uniformity gives him a very singular and rather\nsinister appearance. Everything seems to have happened to his hands\nthat could possibly take place consistently with the retention of all\nthe fingers, for they are notched, and seamed, and crumpled all over.\nHe appears to be very strong and lifts heavy benches about as if he\nhad no idea what weight was. He has a curious way of limping round\nthe gallery with his shoulder against the wall and tacking off at\nobjects he wants to lay hold of instead of going straight to them,\nwhich has left a smear all round the four walls, conventionally\ncalled \"Phil's mark.\"\n\nThis custodian of George's Gallery in George's absence concludes his\nproceedings, when he has locked the great doors and turned out all\nthe lights but one, which he leaves to glimmer, by dragging out from\na wooden cabin in a corner two mattresses and bedding. These being\ndrawn to opposite ends of the gallery, the trooper makes his own bed\nand Phil makes his.\n\n\"Phil!\" says the master, walking towards him without his coat and\nwaistcoat, and looking more soldierly than ever in his braces. \"You\nwere found in a doorway, weren't you?\"\n\n\"Gutter,\" says Phil. \"Watchman tumbled over me.\"\n\n\"Then vagabondizing came natural to YOU from the beginning.\"\n\n\"As nat'ral as possible,\" says Phil.\n\n\"Good night!\"\n\n\"Good night, guv'ner.\"\n\nPhil cannot even go straight to bed, but finds it necessary to\nshoulder round two sides of the gallery and then tack off at his\nmattress. The trooper, after taking a turn or two in the\nrifle-distance and looking up at the moon now shining through the\nskylights, strides to his own mattress by a shorter route and goes to\nbed too.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXII\n\nMr. Bucket\n\n\nAllegory looks pretty cool in Lincoln's Inn Fields, though the\nevening is hot, for both Mr. Tulkinghorn's windows are wide open, and\nthe room is lofty, gusty, and gloomy. These may not be desirable\ncharacteristics when November comes with fog and sleet or January\nwith ice and snow, but they have their merits in the sultry long\nvacation weather. They enable Allegory, though it has cheeks like\npeaches, and knees like bunches of blossoms, and rosy swellings for\ncalves to its legs and muscles to its arms, to look tolerably cool\nto-night.\n\nPlenty of dust comes in at Mr. Tulkinghorn's windows, and plenty more\nhas generated among his furniture and papers. It lies thick\neverywhere. When a breeze from the country that has lost its way\ntakes fright and makes a blind hurry to rush out again, it flings as\nmuch dust in the eyes of Allegory as the law--or Mr. Tulkinghorn, one\nof its trustiest representatives--may scatter, on occasion, in the\neyes of the laity.\n\nIn his lowering magazine of dust, the universal article into which\nhis papers and himself, and all his clients, and all things of earth,\nanimate and inanimate, are resolving, Mr. Tulkinghorn sits at one of\nthe open windows enjoying a bottle of old port. Though a hard-grained\nman, close, dry, and silent, he can enjoy old wine with the best. He\nhas a priceless bin of port in some artful cellar under the Fields,\nwhich is one of his many secrets. When he dines alone in chambers, as\nhe has dined to-day, and has his bit of fish and his steak or chicken\nbrought in from the coffee-house, he descends with a candle to the\nechoing regions below the deserted mansion, and heralded by a remote\nreverberation of thundering doors, comes gravely back encircled by an\nearthy atmosphere and carrying a bottle from which he pours a radiant\nnectar, two score and ten years old, that blushes in the glass to\nfind itself so famous and fills the whole room with the fragrance of\nsouthern grapes.\n\nMr. Tulkinghorn, sitting in the twilight by the open window, enjoys\nhis wine. As if it whispered to him of its fifty years of silence and\nseclusion, it shuts him up the closer. More impenetrable than ever,\nhe sits, and drinks, and mellows as it were in secrecy, pondering at\nthat twilight hour on all the mysteries he knows, associated with\ndarkening woods in the country, and vast blank shut-up houses in\ntown, and perhaps sparing a thought or two for himself, and his\nfamily history, and his money, and his will--all a mystery to every\none--and that one bachelor friend of his, a man of the same mould and\na lawyer too, who lived the same kind of life until he was\nseventy-five years old, and then suddenly conceiving (as it is\nsupposed) an impression that it was too monotonous, gave his gold\nwatch to his hair-dresser one summer evening and walked leisurely\nhome to the Temple and hanged himself.\n\nBut Mr. Tulkinghorn is not alone to-night to ponder at his usual\nlength. Seated at the same table, though with his chair modestly and\nuncomfortably drawn a little way from it, sits a bald, mild, shining\nman who coughs respectfully behind his hand when the lawyer bids him\nfill his glass.\n\n\"Now, Snagsby,\" says Mr. Tulkinghorn, \"to go over this odd story\nagain.\"\n\n\"If you please, sir.\"\n\n\"You told me when you were so good as to step round here last\nnight--\"\n\n\"For which I must ask you to excuse me if it was a liberty, sir; but\nI remember that you had taken a sort of an interest in that person,\nand I thought it possible that you might--just--wish--to--\"\n\nMr. Tulkinghorn is not the man to help him to any conclusion or to\nadmit anything as to any possibility concerning himself. So Mr.\nSnagsby trails off into saying, with an awkward cough, \"I must ask\nyou to excuse the liberty, sir, I am sure.\"\n\n\"Not at all,\" says Mr. Tulkinghorn. \"You told me, Snagsby, that you\nput on your hat and came round without mentioning your intention to\nyour wife. That was prudent I think, because it's not a matter of\nsuch importance that it requires to be mentioned.\"\n\n\"Well, sir,\" returns Mr. Snagsby, \"you see, my little woman is--not\nto put too fine a point upon it--inquisitive. She's inquisitive. Poor\nlittle thing, she's liable to spasms, and it's good for her to have\nher mind employed. In consequence of which she employs it--I should\nsay upon every individual thing she can lay hold of, whether it\nconcerns her or not--especially not. My little woman has a very\nactive mind, sir.\"\n\nMr. Snagsby drinks and murmurs with an admiring cough behind his\nhand, \"Dear me, very fine wine indeed!\"\n\n\"Therefore you kept your visit to yourself last night?\" says Mr.\nTulkinghorn. \"And to-night too?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir, and to-night, too. My little woman is at present in--not\nto put too fine a point on it--in a pious state, or in what she\nconsiders such, and attends the Evening Exertions (which is the name\nthey go by) of a reverend party of the name of Chadband. He has a\ngreat deal of eloquence at his command, undoubtedly, but I am not\nquite favourable to his style myself. That's neither here nor there.\nMy little woman being engaged in that way made it easier for me to\nstep round in a quiet manner.\"\n\nMr. Tulkinghorn assents. \"Fill your glass, Snagsby.\"\n\n\"Thank you, sir, I am sure,\" returns the stationer with his cough of\ndeference. \"This is wonderfully fine wine, sir!\"\n\n\"It is a rare wine now,\" says Mr. Tulkinghorn. \"It is fifty years\nold.\"\n\n\"Is it indeed, sir? But I am not surprised to hear it, I am sure. It\nmight be--any age almost.\" After rendering this general tribute to\nthe port, Mr. Snagsby in his modesty coughs an apology behind his\nhand for drinking anything so precious.\n\n\"Will you run over, once again, what the boy said?\" asks Mr.\nTulkinghorn, putting his hands into the pockets of his rusty\nsmallclothes and leaning quietly back in his chair.\n\n\"With pleasure, sir.\"\n\nThen, with fidelity, though with some prolixity, the law-stationer\nrepeats Jo's statement made to the assembled guests at his house. On\ncoming to the end of his narrative, he gives a great start and breaks\noff with, \"Dear me, sir, I wasn't aware there was any other gentleman\npresent!\"\n\nMr. Snagsby is dismayed to see, standing with an attentive face\nbetween himself and the lawyer at a little distance from the table, a\nperson with a hat and stick in his hand who was not there when he\nhimself came in and has not since entered by the door or by either of\nthe windows. There is a press in the room, but its hinges have not\ncreaked, nor has a step been audible upon the floor. Yet this third\nperson stands there with his attentive face, and his hat and stick in\nhis hands, and his hands behind him, a composed and quiet listener.\nHe is a stoutly built, steady-looking, sharp-eyed man in black, of\nabout the middle-age. Except that he looks at Mr. Snagsby as if he\nwere going to take his portrait, there is nothing remarkable about\nhim at first sight but his ghostly manner of appearing.\n\n\"Don't mind this gentleman,\" says Mr. Tulkinghorn in his quiet way.\n\"This is only Mr. Bucket.\"\n\n\"Oh, indeed, sir?\" returns the stationer, expressing by a cough that\nhe is quite in the dark as to who Mr. Bucket may be.\n\n\"I wanted him to hear this story,\" says the lawyer, \"because I have\nhalf a mind (for a reason) to know more of it, and he is very\nintelligent in such things. What do you say to this, Bucket?\"\n\n\"It's very plain, sir. Since our people have moved this boy on, and\nhe's not to be found on his old lay, if Mr. Snagsby don't object to\ngo down with me to Tom-all-Alone's and point him out, we can have him\nhere in less than a couple of hours' time. I can do it without Mr.\nSnagsby, of course, but this is the shortest way.\"\n\n\"Mr. Bucket is a detective officer, Snagsby,\" says the lawyer in\nexplanation.\n\n\"Is he indeed, sir?\" says Mr. Snagsby with a strong tendency in his\nclump of hair to stand on end.\n\n\"And if you have no real objection to accompany Mr. Bucket to the\nplace in question,\" pursues the lawyer, \"I shall feel obliged to you\nif you will do so.\"\n\nIn a moment's hesitation on the part of Mr. Snagsby, Bucket dips down\nto the bottom of his mind.\n\n\"Don't you be afraid of hurting the boy,\" he says. \"You won't do\nthat. It's all right as far as the boy's concerned. We shall only\nbring him here to ask him a question or so I want to put to him, and\nhe'll be paid for his trouble and sent away again. It'll be a good\njob for him. I promise you, as a man, that you shall see the boy sent\naway all right. Don't you be afraid of hurting him; you an't going to\ndo that.\"\n\n\"Very well, Mr. Tulkinghorn!\" cries Mr. Snagsby cheerfully. And\nreassured, \"Since that's the case--\"\n\n\"Yes! And lookee here, Mr. Snagsby,\" resumes Bucket, taking him aside\nby the arm, tapping him familiarly on the breast, and speaking in a\nconfidential tone. \"You're a man of the world, you know, and a man of\nbusiness, and a man of sense. That's what YOU are.\"\n\n\"I am sure I am much obliged to you for your good opinion,\" returns\nthe stationer with his cough of modesty, \"but--\"\n\n\"That's what YOU are, you know,\" says Bucket. \"Now, it an't necessary\nto say to a man like you, engaged in your business, which is a\nbusiness of trust and requires a person to be wide awake and have his\nsenses about him and his head screwed on tight (I had an uncle in\nyour business once)--it an't necessary to say to a man like you that\nit's the best and wisest way to keep little matters like this quiet.\nDon't you see? Quiet!\"\n\n\"Certainly, certainly,\" returns the other.\n\n\"I don't mind telling YOU,\" says Bucket with an engaging appearance\nof frankness, \"that as far as I can understand it, there seems to be\na doubt whether this dead person wasn't entitled to a little\nproperty, and whether this female hasn't been up to some games\nrespecting that property, don't you see?\"\n\n\"Oh!\" says Mr. Snagsby, but not appearing to see quite distinctly.\n\n\"Now, what YOU want,\" pursues Bucket, again tapping Mr. Snagsby on\nthe breast in a comfortable and soothing manner, \"is that every\nperson should have their rights according to justice. That's what YOU\nwant.\"\n\n\"To be sure,\" returns Mr. Snagsby with a nod.\n\n\"On account of which, and at the same time to oblige a--do you call\nit, in your business, customer or client? I forget how my uncle used\nto call it.\"\n\n\"Why, I generally say customer myself,\" replies Mr. Snagsby.\n\n\"You're right!\" returns Mr. Bucket, shaking hands with him quite\naffectionately. \"--On account of which, and at the same time to\noblige a real good customer, you mean to go down with me, in\nconfidence, to Tom-all-Alone's and to keep the whole thing quiet ever\nafterwards and never mention it to any one. That's about your\nintentions, if I understand you?\"\n\n\"You are right, sir. You are right,\" says Mr. Snagsby.\n\n\"Then here's your hat,\" returns his new friend, quite as intimate\nwith it as if he had made it; \"and if you're ready, I am.\"\n\nThey leave Mr. Tulkinghorn, without a ruffle on the surface of his\nunfathomable depths, drinking his old wine, and go down into the\nstreets.\n\n\"You don't happen to know a very good sort of person of the name of\nGridley, do you?\" says Bucket in friendly converse as they descend\nthe stairs.\n\n\"No,\" says Mr. Snagsby, considering, \"I don't know anybody of that\nname. Why?\"\n\n\"Nothing particular,\" says Bucket; \"only having allowed his temper to\nget a little the better of him and having been threatening some\nrespectable people, he is keeping out of the way of a warrant I have\ngot against him--which it's a pity that a man of sense should do.\"\n\nAs they walk along, Mr. Snagsby observes, as a novelty, that however\nquick their pace may be, his companion still seems in some\nundefinable manner to lurk and lounge; also, that whenever he is\ngoing to turn to the right or left, he pretends to have a fixed\npurpose in his mind of going straight ahead, and wheels off, sharply,\nat the very last moment. Now and then, when they pass a\npolice-constable on his beat, Mr. Snagsby notices that both the\nconstable and his guide fall into a deep abstraction as they come\ntowards each other, and appear entirely to overlook each other, and\nto gaze into space. In a few instances, Mr. Bucket, coming behind\nsome under-sized young man with a shining hat on, and his sleek hair\ntwisted into one flat curl on each side of his head, almost without\nglancing at him touches him with his stick, upon which the young man,\nlooking round, instantly evaporates. For the most part Mr. Bucket\nnotices things in general, with a face as unchanging as the great\nmourning ring on his little finger or the brooch, composed of not\nmuch diamond and a good deal of setting, which he wears in his shirt.\n\nWhen they come at last to Tom-all-Alone's, Mr. Bucket stops for a\nmoment at the corner and takes a lighted bull's-eye from the\nconstable on duty there, who then accompanies him with his own\nparticular bull's-eye at his waist. Between his two conductors, Mr.\nSnagsby passes along the middle of a villainous street, undrained,\nunventilated, deep in black mud and corrupt water--though the roads\nare dry elsewhere--and reeking with such smells and sights that he,\nwho has lived in London all his life, can scarce believe his senses.\nBranching from this street and its heaps of ruins are other streets\nand courts so infamous that Mr. Snagsby sickens in body and mind and\nfeels as if he were going every moment deeper down into the infernal\ngulf.\n\n\"Draw off a bit here, Mr. Snagsby,\" says Bucket as a kind of shabby\npalanquin is borne towards them, surrounded by a noisy crowd. \"Here's\nthe fever coming up the street!\"\n\nAs the unseen wretch goes by, the crowd, leaving that object of\nattraction, hovers round the three visitors like a dream of horrible\nfaces and fades away up alleys and into ruins and behind walls, and\nwith occasional cries and shrill whistles of warning, thenceforth\nflits about them until they leave the place.\n\n\"Are those the fever-houses, Darby?\" Mr. Bucket coolly asks as he\nturns his bull's-eye on a line of stinking ruins.\n\nDarby replies that \"all them are,\" and further that in all, for\nmonths and months, the people \"have been down by dozens\" and have\nbeen carried out dead and dying \"like sheep with the rot.\" Bucket\nobserving to Mr. Snagsby as they go on again that he looks a little\npoorly, Mr. Snagsby answers that he feels as if he couldn't breathe\nthe dreadful air.\n\nThere is inquiry made at various houses for a boy named Jo. As few\npeople are known in Tom-all-Alone's by any Christian sign, there is\nmuch reference to Mr. Snagsby whether he means Carrots, or the\nColonel, or Gallows, or Young Chisel, or Terrier Tip, or Lanky, or\nthe Brick. Mr. Snagsby describes over and over again. There are\nconflicting opinions respecting the original of his picture. Some\nthink it must be Carrots, some say the Brick. The Colonel is\nproduced, but is not at all near the thing. Whenever Mr. Snagsby and\nhis conductors are stationary, the crowd flows round, and from its\nsqualid depths obsequious advice heaves up to Mr. Bucket. Whenever\nthey move, and the angry bull's-eyes glare, it fades away and flits\nabout them up the alleys, and in the ruins, and behind the walls, as\nbefore.\n\nAt last there is a lair found out where Toughy, or the Tough Subject,\nlays him down at night; and it is thought that the Tough Subject may\nbe Jo. Comparison of notes between Mr. Snagsby and the proprietress\nof the house--a drunken face tied up in a black bundle, and flaring\nout of a heap of rags on the floor of a dog-hutch which is her\nprivate apartment--leads to the establishment of this conclusion.\nToughy has gone to the doctor's to get a bottle of stuff for a sick\nwoman but will be here anon.\n\n\"And who have we got here to-night?\" says Mr. Bucket, opening another\ndoor and glaring in with his bull's-eye. \"Two drunken men, eh? And\ntwo women? The men are sound enough,\" turning back each sleeper's arm\nfrom his face to look at him. \"Are these your good men, my dears?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" returns one of the women. \"They are our husbands.\"\n\n\"Brickmakers, eh?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"What are you doing here? You don't belong to London.\"\n\n\"No, sir. We belong to Hertfordshire.\"\n\n\"Whereabouts in Hertfordshire?\"\n\n\"Saint Albans.\"\n\n\"Come up on the tramp?\"\n\n\"We walked up yesterday. There's no work down with us at present, but\nwe have done no good by coming here, and shall do none, I expect.\"\n\n\"That's not the way to do much good,\" says Mr. Bucket, turning his\nhead in the direction of the unconscious figures on the ground.\n\n\"It an't indeed,\" replies the woman with a sigh. \"Jenny and me knows\nit full well.\"\n\nThe room, though two or three feet higher than the door, is so low\nthat the head of the tallest of the visitors would touch the\nblackened ceiling if he stood upright. It is offensive to every\nsense; even the gross candle burns pale and sickly in the polluted\nair. There are a couple of benches and a higher bench by way of\ntable. The men lie asleep where they stumbled down, but the women sit\nby the candle. Lying in the arms of the woman who has spoken is a\nvery young child.\n\n\"Why, what age do you call that little creature?\" says Bucket. \"It\nlooks as if it was born yesterday.\" He is not at all rough about it;\nand as he turns his light gently on the infant, Mr. Snagsby is\nstrangely reminded of another infant, encircled with light, that he\nhas seen in pictures.\n\n\"He is not three weeks old yet, sir,\" says the woman.\n\n\"Is he your child?\"\n\n\"Mine.\"\n\nThe other woman, who was bending over it when they came in, stoops\ndown again and kisses it as it lies asleep.\n\n\"You seem as fond of it as if you were the mother yourself,\" says Mr.\nBucket.\n\n\"I was the mother of one like it, master, and it died.\"\n\n\"Ah, Jenny, Jenny!\" says the other woman to her. \"Better so. Much\nbetter to think of dead than alive, Jenny! Much better!\"\n\n\"Why, you an't such an unnatural woman, I hope,\" returns Bucket\nsternly, \"as to wish your own child dead?\"\n\n\"God knows you are right, master,\" she returns. \"I am not. I'd stand\nbetween it and death with my own life if I could, as true as any\npretty lady.\"\n\n\"Then don't talk in that wrong manner,\" says Mr. Bucket, mollified\nagain. \"Why do you do it?\"\n\n\"It's brought into my head, master,\" returns the woman, her eyes\nfilling with tears, \"when I look down at the child lying so. If it\nwas never to wake no more, you'd think me mad, I should take on so. I\nknow that very well. I was with Jenny when she lost hers--warn't I,\nJenny?--and I know how she grieved. But look around you at this\nplace. Look at them,\" glancing at the sleepers on the ground. \"Look\nat the boy you're waiting for, who's gone out to do me a good turn.\nThink of the children that your business lays with often and often,\nand that YOU see grow up!\"\n\n\"Well, well,\" says Mr. Bucket, \"you train him respectable, and he'll\nbe a comfort to you, and look after you in your old age, you know.\"\n\n\"I mean to try hard,\" she answers, wiping her eyes. \"But I have been\na-thinking, being over-tired to-night and not well with the ague, of\nall the many things that'll come in his way. My master will be\nagainst it, and he'll be beat, and see me beat, and made to fear his\nhome, and perhaps to stray wild. If I work for him ever so much, and\never so hard, there's no one to help me; and if he should be turned\nbad 'spite of all I could do, and the time should come when I should\nsit by him in his sleep, made hard and changed, an't it likely I\nshould think of him as he lies in my lap now and wish he had died as\nJenny's child died!\"\n\n\"There, there!\" says Jenny. \"Liz, you're tired and ill. Let me take\nhim.\"\n\nIn doing so, she displaces the mother's dress, but quickly readjusts\nit over the wounded and bruised bosom where the baby has been lying.\n\n\"It's my dead child,\" says Jenny, walking up and down as she nurses,\n\"that makes me love this child so dear, and it's my dead child that\nmakes her love it so dear too, as even to think of its being taken\naway from her now. While she thinks that, I think what fortune would\nI give to have my darling back. But we mean the same thing, if we\nknew how to say it, us two mothers does in our poor hearts!\"\n\nAs Mr. Snagsby blows his nose and coughs his cough of sympathy, a\nstep is heard without. Mr. Bucket throws his light into the doorway\nand says to Mr. Snagsby, \"Now, what do you say to Toughy? Will HE\ndo?\"\n\n\"That's Jo,\" says Mr. Snagsby.\n\nJo stands amazed in the disk of light, like a ragged figure in a\nmagic-lantern, trembling to think that he has offended against the\nlaw in not having moved on far enough. Mr. Snagsby, however, giving\nhim the consolatory assurance, \"It's only a job you will be paid for,\nJo,\" he recovers; and on being taken outside by Mr. Bucket for a\nlittle private confabulation, tells his tale satisfactorily, though\nout of breath.\n\n\"I have squared it with the lad,\" says Mr. Bucket, returning, \"and\nit's all right. Now, Mr. Snagsby, we're ready for you.\"\n\nFirst, Jo has to complete his errand of good nature by handing over\nthe physic he has been to get, which he delivers with the laconic\nverbal direction that \"it's to be all took d'rectly.\" Secondly, Mr.\nSnagsby has to lay upon the table half a crown, his usual panacea for\nan immense variety of afflictions. Thirdly, Mr. Bucket has to take Jo\nby the arm a little above the elbow and walk him on before him,\nwithout which observance neither the Tough Subject nor any other\nSubject could be professionally conducted to Lincoln's Inn Fields.\nThese arrangements completed, they give the women good night and come\nout once more into black and foul Tom-all-Alone's.\n\nBy the noisome ways through which they descended into that pit, they\ngradually emerge from it, the crowd flitting, and whistling, and\nskulking about them until they come to the verge, where restoration\nof the bull's-eyes is made to Darby. Here the crowd, like a concourse\nof imprisoned demons, turns back, yelling, and is seen no more.\nThrough the clearer and fresher streets, never so clear and fresh to\nMr. Snagsby's mind as now, they walk and ride until they come to Mr.\nTulkinghorn's gate.\n\nAs they ascend the dim stairs (Mr. Tulkinghorn's chambers being on\nthe first floor), Mr. Bucket mentions that he has the key of the\nouter door in his pocket and that there is no need to ring. For a man\nso expert in most things of that kind, Bucket takes time to open the\ndoor and makes some noise too. It may be that he sounds a note of\npreparation.\n\nHowbeit, they come at last into the hall, where a lamp is burning,\nand so into Mr. Tulkinghorn's usual room--the room where he drank his\nold wine to-night. He is not there, but his two old-fashioned\ncandlesticks are, and the room is tolerably light.\n\nMr. Bucket, still having his professional hold of Jo and appearing to\nMr. Snagsby to possess an unlimited number of eyes, makes a little\nway into this room, when Jo starts and stops.\n\n\"What's the matter?\" says Bucket in a whisper.\n\n\"There she is!\" cries Jo.\n\n\"Who!\"\n\n\"The lady!\"\n\nA female figure, closely veiled, stands in the middle of the room,\nwhere the light falls upon it. It is quite still and silent. The\nfront of the figure is towards them, but it takes no notice of their\nentrance and remains like a statue.\n\n\"Now, tell me,\" says Bucket aloud, \"how you know that to be the\nlady.\"\n\n\"I know the wale,\" replies Jo, staring, \"and the bonnet, and the\ngownd.\"\n\n\"Be quite sure of what you say, Tough,\" returns Bucket, narrowly\nobservant of him. \"Look again.\"\n\n\"I am a-looking as hard as ever I can look,\" says Jo with starting\neyes, \"and that there's the wale, the bonnet, and the gownd.\"\n\n\"What about those rings you told me of?\" asks Bucket.\n\n\"A-sparkling all over here,\" says Jo, rubbing the fingers of his left\nhand on the knuckles of his right without taking his eyes from the\nfigure.\n\nThe figure removes the right-hand glove and shows the hand.\n\n\"Now, what do you say to that?\" asks Bucket.\n\nJo shakes his head. \"Not rings a bit like them. Not a hand like\nthat.\"\n\n\"What are you talking of?\" says Bucket, evidently pleased though, and\nwell pleased too.\n\n\"Hand was a deal whiter, a deal delicater, and a deal smaller,\"\nreturns Jo.\n\n\"Why, you'll tell me I'm my own mother next,\" says Mr. Bucket. \"Do\nyou recollect the lady's voice?\"\n\n\"I think I does,\" says Jo.\n\nThe figure speaks. \"Was it at all like this? I will speak as long as\nyou like if you are not sure. Was it this voice, or at all like this\nvoice?\"\n\nJo looks aghast at Mr. Bucket. \"Not a bit!\"\n\n\"Then, what,\" retorts that worthy, pointing to the figure, \"did you\nsay it was the lady for?\"\n\n\"Cos,\" says Jo with a perplexed stare but without being at all shaken\nin his certainty, \"cos that there's the wale, the bonnet, and the\ngownd. It is her and it an't her. It an't her hand, nor yet her\nrings, nor yet her woice. But that there's the wale, the bonnet, and\nthe gownd, and they're wore the same way wot she wore 'em, and it's\nher height wot she wos, and she giv me a sov'ring and hooked it.\"\n\n\"Well!\" says Mr. Bucket slightly, \"we haven't got much good out of\nYOU. But, however, here's five shillings for you. Take care how you\nspend it, and don't get yourself into trouble.\" Bucket stealthily\ntells the coins from one hand into the other like counters--which is\na way he has, his principal use of them being in these games of\nskill--and then puts them, in a little pile, into the boy's hand and\ntakes him out to the door, leaving Mr. Snagsby, not by any means\ncomfortable under these mysterious circumstances, alone with the\nveiled figure. But on Mr. Tulkinghorn's coming into the room, the\nveil is raised and a sufficiently good-looking Frenchwoman is\nrevealed, though her expression is something of the intensest.\n\n\"Thank you, Mademoiselle Hortense,\" says Mr. Tulkinghorn with his\nusual equanimity. \"I will give you no further trouble about this\nlittle wager.\"\n\n\"You will do me the kindness to remember, sir, that I am not at\npresent placed?\" says mademoiselle.\n\n\"Certainly, certainly!\"\n\n\"And to confer upon me the favour of your distinguished\nrecommendation?\"\n\n\"By all means, Mademoiselle Hortense.\"\n\n\"A word from Mr. Tulkinghorn is so powerful.\"\n\n\"It shall not be wanting, mademoiselle.\"\n\n\"Receive the assurance of my devoted gratitude, dear sir.\"\n\n\"Good night.\"\n\nMademoiselle goes out with an air of native gentility; and Mr.\nBucket, to whom it is, on an emergency, as natural to be groom of the\nceremonies as it is to be anything else, shows her downstairs, not\nwithout gallantry.\n\n\"Well, Bucket?\" quoth Mr. Tulkinghorn on his return.\n\n\"It's all squared, you see, as I squared it myself, sir. There an't a\ndoubt that it was the other one with this one's dress on. The boy was\nexact respecting colours and everything. Mr. Snagsby, I promised you\nas a man that he should be sent away all right. Don't say it wasn't\ndone!\"\n\n\"You have kept your word, sir,\" returns the stationer; \"and if I can\nbe of no further use, Mr. Tulkinghorn, I think, as my little woman\nwill be getting anxious--\"\n\n\"Thank you, Snagsby, no further use,\" says Mr. Tulkinghorn. \"I am\nquite indebted to you for the trouble you have taken already.\"\n\n\"Not at all, sir. I wish you good night.\"\n\n\"You see, Mr. Snagsby,\" says Mr. Bucket, accompanying him to the door\nand shaking hands with him over and over again, \"what I like in you\nis that you're a man it's of no use pumping; that's what YOU are.\nWhen you know you have done a right thing, you put it away, and it's\ndone with and gone, and there's an end of it. That's what YOU do.\"\n\n\"That is certainly what I endeavour to do, sir,\" returns Mr. Snagsby.\n\n\"No, you don't do yourself justice. It an't what you endeavour to\ndo,\" says Mr. Bucket, shaking hands with him and blessing him in the\ntenderest manner, \"it's what you DO. That's what I estimate in a man\nin your way of business.\"\n\nMr. Snagsby makes a suitable response and goes homeward so confused\nby the events of the evening that he is doubtful of his being awake\nand out--doubtful of the reality of the streets through which he\ngoes--doubtful of the reality of the moon that shines above him. He\nis presently reassured on these subjects by the unchallengeable\nreality of Mrs. Snagsby, sitting up with her head in a perfect\nbeehive of curl-papers and night-cap, who has dispatched Guster to\nthe police-station with official intelligence of her husband's being\nmade away with, and who within the last two hours has passed through\nevery stage of swooning with the greatest decorum. But as the little\nwoman feelingly says, many thanks she gets for it!\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIII\n\nEsther's Narrative\n\n\nWe came home from Mr. Boythorn's after six pleasant weeks. We were\noften in the park and in the woods and seldom passed the lodge where\nwe had taken shelter without looking in to speak to the keeper's\nwife; but we saw no more of Lady Dedlock, except at church on\nSundays. There was company at Chesney Wold; and although several\nbeautiful faces surrounded her, her face retained the same influence\non me as at first. I do not quite know even now whether it was\npainful or pleasurable, whether it drew me towards her or made me\nshrink from her. I think I admired her with a kind of fear, and I\nknow that in her presence my thoughts always wandered back, as they\nhad done at first, to that old time of my life.\n\nI had a fancy, on more than one of these Sundays, that what this lady\nso curiously was to me, I was to her--I mean that I disturbed her\nthoughts as she influenced mine, though in some different way. But\nwhen I stole a glance at her and saw her so composed and distant and\nunapproachable, I felt this to be a foolish weakness. Indeed, I felt\nthe whole state of my mind in reference to her to be weak and\nunreasonable, and I remonstrated with myself about it as much as I\ncould.\n\nOne incident that occurred before we quitted Mr. Boythorn's house, I\nhad better mention in this place.\n\nI was walking in the garden with Ada when I was told that some one\nwished to see me. Going into the breakfast-room where this person was\nwaiting, I found it to be the French maid who had cast off her shoes\nand walked through the wet grass on the day when it thundered and\nlightened.\n\n\"Mademoiselle,\" she began, looking fixedly at me with her too-eager\neyes, though otherwise presenting an agreeable appearance and\nspeaking neither with boldness nor servility, \"I have taken a great\nliberty in coming here, but you know how to excuse it, being so\namiable, mademoiselle.\"\n\n\"No excuse is necessary,\" I returned, \"if you wish to speak to me.\"\n\n\"That is my desire, mademoiselle. A thousand thanks for the\npermission. I have your leave to speak. Is it not?\" she said in a\nquick, natural way.\n\n\"Certainly,\" said I.\n\n\"Mademoiselle, you are so amiable! Listen then, if you please. I have\nleft my Lady. We could not agree. My Lady is so high, so very high.\nPardon! Mademoiselle, you are right!\" Her quickness anticipated what\nI might have said presently but as yet had only thought. \"It is not\nfor me to come here to complain of my Lady. But I say she is so high,\nso very high. I will not say a word more. All the world knows that.\"\n\n\"Go on, if you please,\" said I.\n\n\"Assuredly; mademoiselle, I am thankful for your politeness.\nMademoiselle, I have an inexpressible desire to find service with a\nyoung lady who is good, accomplished, beautiful. You are good,\naccomplished, and beautiful as an angel. Ah, could I have the honour\nof being your domestic!\"\n\n\"I am sorry--\" I began.\n\n\"Do not dismiss me so soon, mademoiselle!\" she said with an\ninvoluntary contraction of her fine black eyebrows. \"Let me hope a\nmoment! Mademoiselle, I know this service would be more retired than\nthat which I have quitted. Well! I wish that. I know this service\nwould be less distinguished than that which I have quitted. Well! I\nwish that, I know that I should win less, as to wages here. Good. I\nam content.\"\n\n\"I assure you,\" said I, quite embarrassed by the mere idea of having\nsuch an attendant, \"that I keep no maid--\"\n\n\"Ah, mademoiselle, but why not? Why not, when you can have one so\ndevoted to you! Who would be enchanted to serve you; who would be so\ntrue, so zealous, and so faithful every day! Mademoiselle, I wish\nwith all my heart to serve you. Do not speak of money at present.\nTake me as I am. For nothing!\"\n\nShe was so singularly earnest that I drew back, almost afraid of her.\nWithout appearing to notice it, in her ardour she still pressed\nherself upon me, speaking in a rapid subdued voice, though always\nwith a certain grace and propriety.\n\n\"Mademoiselle, I come from the South country where we are quick and\nwhere we like and dislike very strong. My Lady was too high for me; I\nwas too high for her. It is done--past--finished! Receive me as your\ndomestic, and I will serve you well. I will do more for you than you\nfigure to yourself now. Chut! Mademoiselle, I will--no matter, I will\ndo my utmost possible in all things. If you accept my service, you\nwill not repent it. Mademoiselle, you will not repent it, and I will\nserve you well. You don't know how well!\"\n\nThere was a lowering energy in her face as she stood looking at me\nwhile I explained the impossibility of my engaging her (without\nthinking it necessary to say how very little I desired to do so),\nwhich seemed to bring visibly before me some woman from the streets\nof Paris in the reign of terror.\n\nShe heard me out without interruption and then said with her pretty\naccent and in her mildest voice, \"Hey, mademoiselle, I have received\nmy answer! I am sorry of it. But I must go elsewhere and seek what I\nhave not found here. Will you graciously let me kiss your hand?\"\n\nShe looked at me more intently as she took it, and seemed to take\nnote, with her momentary touch, of every vein in it. \"I fear I\nsurprised you, mademoiselle, on the day of the storm?\" she said with\na parting curtsy.\n\nI confessed that she had surprised us all.\n\n\"I took an oath, mademoiselle,\" she said, smiling, \"and I wanted to\nstamp it on my mind so that I might keep it faithfully. And I will!\nAdieu, mademoiselle!\"\n\nSo ended our conference, which I was very glad to bring to a close. I\nsupposed she went away from the village, for I saw her no more; and\nnothing else occurred to disturb our tranquil summer pleasures until\nsix weeks were out and we returned home as I began just now by\nsaying.\n\nAt that time, and for a good many weeks after that time, Richard was\nconstant in his visits. Besides coming every Saturday or Sunday and\nremaining with us until Monday morning, he sometimes rode out on\nhorseback unexpectedly and passed the evening with us and rode back\nagain early next day. He was as vivacious as ever and told us he was\nvery industrious, but I was not easy in my mind about him. It\nappeared to me that his industry was all misdirected. I could not\nfind that it led to anything but the formation of delusive hopes in\nconnexion with the suit already the pernicious cause of so much\nsorrow and ruin. He had got at the core of that mystery now, he told\nus, and nothing could be plainer than that the will under which he\nand Ada were to take I don't know how many thousands of pounds must\nbe finally established if there were any sense or justice in the\nCourt of Chancery--but oh, what a great IF that sounded in my\nears--and that this happy conclusion could not be much longer\ndelayed. He proved this to himself by all the weary arguments on that\nside he had read, and every one of them sunk him deeper in the\ninfatuation. He had even begun to haunt the court. He told us how he\nsaw Miss Flite there daily, how they talked together, and how he did\nher little kindnesses, and how, while he laughed at her, he pitied\nher from his heart. But he never thought--never, my poor, dear,\nsanguine Richard, capable of so much happiness then, and with such\nbetter things before him--what a fatal link was riveting between his\nfresh youth and her faded age, between his free hopes and her caged\nbirds, and her hungry garret, and her wandering mind.\n\nAda loved him too well to mistrust him much in anything he said or\ndid, and my guardian, though he frequently complained of the east\nwind and read more than usual in the growlery, preserved a strict\nsilence on the subject. So I thought one day when I went to London to\nmeet Caddy Jellyby, at her solicitation, I would ask Richard to be in\nwaiting for me at the coach-office, that we might have a little talk\ntogether. I found him there when I arrived, and we walked away arm in\narm.\n\n\"Well, Richard,\" said I as soon as I could begin to be grave with\nhim, \"are you beginning to feel more settled now?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, my dear!\" returned Richard. \"I'm all right enough.\"\n\n\"But settled?\" said I.\n\n\"How do you mean, settled?\" returned Richard with his gay laugh.\n\n\"Settled in the law,\" said I.\n\n\"Oh, aye,\" replied Richard, \"I'm all right enough.\"\n\n\"You said that before, my dear Richard.\"\n\n\"And you don't think it's an answer, eh? Well! Perhaps it's not.\nSettled? You mean, do I feel as if I were settling down?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Why, no, I can't say I am settling down,\" said Richard, strongly\nemphasizing \"down,\" as if that expressed the difficulty, \"because one\ncan't settle down while this business remains in such an unsettled\nstate. When I say this business, of course I mean the--forbidden\nsubject.\"\n\n\"Do you think it will ever be in a settled state?\" said I.\n\n\"Not the least doubt of it,\" answered Richard.\n\nWe walked a little way without speaking, and presently Richard\naddressed me in his frankest and most feeling manner, thus: \"My dear\nEsther, I understand you, and I wish to heaven I were a more constant\nsort of fellow. I don't mean constant to Ada, for I love her\ndearly--better and better every day--but constant to myself.\n(Somehow, I mean something that I can't very well express, but you'll\nmake it out.) If I were a more constant sort of fellow, I should have\nheld on either to Badger or to Kenge and Carboy like grim death, and\nshould have begun to be steady and systematic by this time, and\nshouldn't be in debt, and--\"\n\n\"ARE you in debt, Richard?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Richard, \"I am a little so, my dear. Also, I have taken\nrather too much to billiards and that sort of thing. Now the murder's\nout; you despise me, Esther, don't you?\"\n\n\"You know I don't,\" said I.\n\n\"You are kinder to me than I often am to myself,\" he returned. \"My\ndear Esther, I am a very unfortunate dog not to be more settled, but\nhow CAN I be more settled? If you lived in an unfinished house, you\ncouldn't settle down in it; if you were condemned to leave everything\nyou undertook unfinished, you would find it hard to apply yourself to\nanything; and yet that's my unhappy case. I was born into this\nunfinished contention with all its chances and changes, and it began\nto unsettle me before I quite knew the difference between a suit at\nlaw and a suit of clothes; and it has gone on unsettling me ever\nsince; and here I am now, conscious sometimes that I am but a\nworthless fellow to love my confiding cousin Ada.\"\n\nWe were in a solitary place, and he put his hands before his eyes and\nsobbed as he said the words.\n\n\"Oh, Richard!\" said I. \"Do not be so moved. You have a noble nature,\nand Ada's love may make you worthier every day.\"\n\n\"I know, my dear,\" he replied, pressing my arm, \"I know all that. You\nmustn't mind my being a little soft now, for I have had all this upon\nmy mind for a long time, and have often meant to speak to you, and\nhave sometimes wanted opportunity and sometimes courage. I know what\nthe thought of Ada ought to do for me, but it doesn't do it. I am too\nunsettled even for that. I love her most devotedly, and yet I do her\nwrong, in doing myself wrong, every day and hour. But it can't last\nfor ever. We shall come on for a final hearing and get judgment in\nour favour, and then you and Ada shall see what I can really be!\"\n\nIt had given me a pang to hear him sob and see the tears start out\nbetween his fingers, but that was infinitely less affecting to me\nthan the hopeful animation with which he said these words.\n\n\"I have looked well into the papers, Esther. I have been deep in them\nfor months,\" he continued, recovering his cheerfulness in a moment,\n\"and you may rely upon it that we shall come out triumphant. As to\nyears of delay, there has been no want of them, heaven knows! And\nthere is the greater probability of our bringing the matter to a\nspeedy close; in fact, it's on the paper now. It will be all right at\nlast, and then you shall see!\"\n\nRecalling how he had just now placed Messrs. Kenge and Carboy in the\nsame category with Mr. Badger, I asked him when he intended to be\narticled in Lincoln's Inn.\n\n\"There again! I think not at all, Esther,\" he returned with an\neffort. \"I fancy I have had enough of it. Having worked at Jarndyce\nand Jarndyce like a galley slave, I have slaked my thirst for the law\nand satisfied myself that I shouldn't like it. Besides, I find it\nunsettles me more and more to be so constantly upon the scene of\naction. So what,\" continued Richard, confident again by this time,\n\"do I naturally turn my thoughts to?\"\n\n\"I can't imagine,\" said I.\n\n\"Don't look so serious,\" returned Richard, \"because it's the best\nthing I can do, my dear Esther, I am certain. It's not as if I wanted\na profession for life. These proceedings will come to a termination,\nand then I am provided for. No. I look upon it as a pursuit which is\nin its nature more or less unsettled, and therefore suited to my\ntemporary condition--I may say, precisely suited. What is it that I\nnaturally turn my thoughts to?\"\n\nI looked at him and shook my head.\n\n\"What,\" said Richard, in a tone of perfect conviction, \"but the\narmy!\"\n\n\"The army?\" said I.\n\n\"The army, of course. What I have to do is to get a commission;\nand--there I am, you know!\" said Richard.\n\nAnd then he showed me, proved by elaborate calculations in his\npocket-book, that supposing he had contracted, say, two hundred\npounds of debt in six months out of the army; and that he contracted\nno debt at all within a corresponding period in the army--as to which\nhe had quite made up his mind; this step must involve a saving of\nfour hundred pounds in a year, or two thousand pounds in five years,\nwhich was a considerable sum. And then he spoke so ingenuously and\nsincerely of the sacrifice he made in withdrawing himself for a time\nfrom Ada, and of the earnestness with which he aspired--as in thought\nhe always did, I know full well--to repay her love, and to ensure her\nhappiness, and to conquer what was amiss in himself, and to acquire\nthe very soul of decision, that he made my heart ache keenly, sorely.\nFor, I thought, how would this end, how could this end, when so soon\nand so surely all his manly qualities were touched by the fatal\nblight that ruined everything it rested on!\n\nI spoke to Richard with all the earnestness I felt, and all the hope\nI could not quite feel then, and implored him for Ada's sake not to\nput any trust in Chancery. To all I said, Richard readily assented,\nriding over the court and everything else in his easy way and drawing\nthe brightest pictures of the character he was to settle into--alas,\nwhen the grievous suit should loose its hold upon him! We had a long\ntalk, but it always came back to that, in substance.\n\nAt last we came to Soho Square, where Caddy Jellyby had appointed to\nwait for me, as a quiet place in the neighbourhood of Newman Street.\nCaddy was in the garden in the centre and hurried out as soon as I\nappeared. After a few cheerful words, Richard left us together.\n\n\"Prince has a pupil over the way, Esther,\" said Caddy, \"and got the\nkey for us. So if you will walk round and round here with me, we can\nlock ourselves in and I can tell you comfortably what I wanted to see\nyour dear good face about.\"\n\n\"Very well, my dear,\" said I. \"Nothing could be better.\" So Caddy,\nafter affectionately squeezing the dear good face as she called it,\nlocked the gate, and took my arm, and we began to walk round the\ngarden very cosily.\n\n\"You see, Esther,\" said Caddy, who thoroughly enjoyed a little\nconfidence, \"after you spoke to me about its being wrong to marry\nwithout Ma's knowledge, or even to keep Ma long in the dark\nrespecting our engagement--though I don't believe Ma cares much for\nme, I must say--I thought it right to mention your opinions to\nPrince. In the first place because I want to profit by everything you\ntell me, and in the second place because I have no secrets from\nPrince.\"\n\n\"I hope he approved, Caddy?\"\n\n\"Oh, my dear! I assure you he would approve of anything you could\nsay. You have no idea what an opinion he has of you!\"\n\n\"Indeed!\"\n\n\"Esther, it's enough to make anybody but me jealous,\" said Caddy,\nlaughing and shaking her head; \"but it only makes me joyful, for you\nare the first friend I ever had, and the best friend I ever can have,\nand nobody can respect and love you too much to please me.\"\n\n\"Upon my word, Caddy,\" said I, \"you are in the general conspiracy to\nkeep me in a good humour. Well, my dear?\"\n\n\"Well! I am going to tell you,\" replied Caddy, crossing her hands\nconfidentially upon my arm. \"So we talked a good deal about it, and\nso I said to Prince, 'Prince, as Miss Summerson--'\"\n\n\"I hope you didn't say 'Miss Summerson'?\"\n\n\"No. I didn't!\" cried Caddy, greatly pleased and with the brightest\nof faces. \"I said, 'Esther.' I said to Prince, 'As Esther is\ndecidedly of that opinion, Prince, and has expressed it to me, and\nalways hints it when she writes those kind notes, which you are so\nfond of hearing me read to you, I am prepared to disclose the truth\nto Ma whenever you think proper. And I think, Prince,' said I, 'that\nEsther thinks that I should be in a better, and truer, and more\nhonourable position altogether if you did the same to your papa.'\"\n\n\"Yes, my dear,\" said I. \"Esther certainly does think so.\"\n\n\"So I was right, you see!\" exclaimed Caddy. \"Well! This troubled\nPrince a good deal, not because he had the least doubt about it, but\nbecause he is so considerate of the feelings of old Mr. Turveydrop;\nand he had his apprehensions that old Mr. Turveydrop might break his\nheart, or faint away, or be very much overcome in some affecting\nmanner or other if he made such an announcement. He feared old Mr.\nTurveydrop might consider it undutiful and might receive too great a\nshock. For old Mr. Turveydrop's deportment is very beautiful, you\nknow, Esther,\" said Caddy, \"and his feelings are extremely\nsensitive.\"\n\n\"Are they, my dear?\"\n\n\"Oh, extremely sensitive. Prince says so. Now, this has caused my\ndarling child--I didn't mean to use the expression to you, Esther,\"\nCaddy apologized, her face suffused with blushes, \"but I generally\ncall Prince my darling child.\"\n\nI laughed; and Caddy laughed and blushed, and went on.\n\n\"This has caused him, Esther--\"\n\n\"Caused whom, my dear?\"\n\n\"Oh, you tiresome thing!\" said Caddy, laughing, with her pretty face\non fire. \"My darling child, if you insist upon it! This has caused\nhim weeks of uneasiness and has made him delay, from day to day, in a\nvery anxious manner. At last he said to me, 'Caddy, if Miss\nSummerson, who is a great favourite with my father, could be\nprevailed upon to be present when I broke the subject, I think I\ncould do it.' So I promised I would ask you. And I made up my mind,\nbesides,\" said Caddy, looking at me hopefully but timidly, \"that if\nyou consented, I would ask you afterwards to come with me to Ma. This\nis what I meant when I said in my note that I had a great favour and\na great assistance to beg of you. And if you thought you could grant\nit, Esther, we should both be very grateful.\"\n\n\"Let me see, Caddy,\" said I, pretending to consider. \"Really, I think\nI could do a greater thing than that if the need were pressing. I am\nat your service and the darling child's, my dear, whenever you like.\"\n\nCaddy was quite transported by this reply of mine, being, I believe,\nas susceptible to the least kindness or encouragement as any tender\nheart that ever beat in this world; and after another turn or two\nround the garden, during which she put on an entirely new pair of\ngloves and made herself as resplendent as possible that she might do\nno avoidable discredit to the Master of Deportment, we went to Newman\nStreet direct.\n\nPrince was teaching, of course. We found him engaged with a not very\nhopeful pupil--a stubborn little girl with a sulky forehead, a deep\nvoice, and an inanimate, dissatisfied mama--whose case was certainly\nnot rendered more hopeful by the confusion into which we threw her\npreceptor. The lesson at last came to an end, after proceeding as\ndiscordantly as possible; and when the little girl had changed her\nshoes and had had her white muslin extinguished in shawls, she was\ntaken away. After a few words of preparation, we then went in search\nof Mr. Turveydrop, whom we found, grouped with his hat and gloves, as\na model of deportment, on the sofa in his private apartment--the only\ncomfortable room in the house. He appeared to have dressed at his\nleisure in the intervals of a light collation, and his dressing-case,\nbrushes, and so forth, all of quite an elegant kind, lay about.\n\n\"Father, Miss Summerson; Miss Jellyby.\"\n\n\"Charmed! Enchanted!\" said Mr. Turveydrop, rising with his\nhigh-shouldered bow. \"Permit me!\" Handing chairs. \"Be seated!\"\nKissing the tips of his left fingers. \"Overjoyed!\" Shutting his eyes\nand rolling. \"My little retreat is made a paradise.\" Recomposing\nhimself on the sofa like the second gentleman in Europe.\n\n\"Again you find us, Miss Summerson,\" said he, \"using our little arts\nto polish, polish! Again the sex stimulates us and rewards us by the\ncondescension of its lovely presence. It is much in these times (and\nwe have made an awfully degenerating business of it since the days of\nhis Royal Highness the Prince Regent--my patron, if I may presume to\nsay so) to experience that deportment is not wholly trodden under\nfoot by mechanics. That it can yet bask in the smile of beauty, my\ndear madam.\"\n\nI said nothing, which I thought a suitable reply; and he took a pinch\nof snuff.\n\n\"My dear son,\" said Mr. Turveydrop, \"you have four schools this\nafternoon. I would recommend a hasty sandwich.\"\n\n\"Thank you, father,\" returned Prince, \"I will be sure to be punctual.\nMy dear father, may I beg you to prepare your mind for what I am\ngoing to say?\"\n\n\"Good heaven!\" exclaimed the model, pale and aghast as Prince and\nCaddy, hand in hand, bent down before him. \"What is this? Is this\nlunacy! Or what is this?\"\n\n\"Father,\" returned Prince with great submission, \"I love this young\nlady, and we are engaged.\"\n\n\"Engaged!\" cried Mr. Turveydrop, reclining on the sofa and shutting\nout the sight with his hand. \"An arrow launched at my brain by my own\nchild!\"\n\n\"We have been engaged for some time, father,\" faltered Prince, \"and\nMiss Summerson, hearing of it, advised that we should declare the\nfact to you and was so very kind as to attend on the present\noccasion. Miss Jellyby is a young lady who deeply respects you,\nfather.\"\n\nMr. Turveydrop uttered a groan.\n\n\"No, pray don't! Pray don't, father,\" urged his son. \"Miss Jellyby is\na young lady who deeply respects you, and our first desire is to\nconsider your comfort.\"\n\nMr. Turveydrop sobbed.\n\n\"No, pray don't, father!\" cried his son.\n\n\"Boy,\" said Mr. Turveydrop, \"it is well that your sainted mother is\nspared this pang. Strike deep, and spare not. Strike home, sir,\nstrike home!\"\n\n\"Pray don't say so, father,\" implored Prince, in tears. \"It goes to\nmy heart. I do assure you, father, that our first wish and intention\nis to consider your comfort. Caroline and I do not forget our\nduty--what is my duty is Caroline's, as we have often said\ntogether--and with your approval and consent, father, we will devote\nourselves to making your life agreeable.\"\n\n\"Strike home,\" murmured Mr. Turveydrop. \"Strike home!\" But he seemed\nto listen, I thought, too.\n\n\"My dear father,\" returned Prince, \"we well know what little comforts\nyou are accustomed to and have a right to, and it will always be our\nstudy and our pride to provide those before anything. If you will\nbless us with your approval and consent, father, we shall not think\nof being married until it is quite agreeable to you; and when we ARE\nmarried, we shall always make you--of course--our first\nconsideration. You must ever be the head and master here, father; and\nwe feel how truly unnatural it would be in us if we failed to know it\nor if we failed to exert ourselves in every possible way to please\nyou.\"\n\nMr. Turveydrop underwent a severe internal struggle and came upright\non the sofa again with his cheeks puffing over his stiff cravat, a\nperfect model of parental deportment.\n\n\"My son!\" said Mr. Turveydrop. \"My children! I cannot resist your\nprayer. Be happy!\"\n\nHis benignity as he raised his future daughter-in-law and stretched\nout his hand to his son (who kissed it with affectionate respect and\ngratitude) was the most confusing sight I ever saw.\n\n\"My children,\" said Mr. Turveydrop, paternally encircling Caddy with\nhis left arm as she sat beside him, and putting his right hand\ngracefully on his hip. \"My son and daughter, your happiness shall be\nmy care. I will watch over you. You shall always live with\nme\"--meaning, of course, I will always live with you--\"this house is\nhenceforth as much yours as mine; consider it your home. May you long\nlive to share it with me!\"\n\nThe power of his deportment was such that they really were as much\novercome with thankfulness as if, instead of quartering himself upon\nthem for the rest of his life, he were making some munificent\nsacrifice in their favour.\n\n\"For myself, my children,\" said Mr. Turveydrop, \"I am falling into\nthe sear and yellow leaf, and it is impossible to say how long the\nlast feeble traces of gentlemanly deportment may linger in this\nweaving and spinning age. But, so long, I will do my duty to society\nand will show myself, as usual, about town. My wants are few and\nsimple. My little apartment here, my few essentials for the toilet,\nmy frugal morning meal, and my little dinner will suffice. I charge\nyour dutiful affection with the supply of these requirements, and I\ncharge myself with all the rest.\"\n\nThey were overpowered afresh by his uncommon generosity.\n\n\"My son,\" said Mr. Turveydrop, \"for those little points in which you\nare deficient--points of deportment, which are born with a man, which\nmay be improved by cultivation, but can never be originated--you may\nstill rely on me. I have been faithful to my post since the days of\nhis Royal Highness the Prince Regent, and I will not desert it now.\nNo, my son. If you have ever contemplated your father's poor position\nwith a feeling of pride, you may rest assured that he will do nothing\nto tarnish it. For yourself, Prince, whose character is different (we\ncannot be all alike, nor is it advisable that we should), work, be\nindustrious, earn money, and extend the connexion as much as\npossible.\"\n\n\"That you may depend I will do, dear father, with all my heart,\"\nreplied Prince.\n\n\"I have no doubt of it,\" said Mr. Turveydrop. \"Your qualities are not\nshining, my dear child, but they are steady and useful. And to both\nof you, my children, I would merely observe, in the spirit of a\nsainted wooman on whose path I had the happiness of casting, I\nbelieve, SOME ray of light, take care of the establishment, take care\nof my simple wants, and bless you both!\"\n\nOld Mr. Turveydrop then became so very gallant, in honour of the\noccasion, that I told Caddy we must really go to Thavies Inn at once\nif we were to go at all that day. So we took our departure after a\nvery loving farewell between Caddy and her betrothed, and during our\nwalk she was so happy and so full of old Mr. Turveydrop's praises\nthat I would not have said a word in his disparagement for any\nconsideration.\n\nThe house in Thavies Inn had bills in the windows announcing that it\nwas to let, and it looked dirtier and gloomier and ghastlier than\never. The name of poor Mr. Jellyby had appeared in the list of\nbankrupts but a day or two before, and he was shut up in the\ndining-room with two gentlemen and a heap of blue bags,\naccount-books, and papers, making the most desperate endeavours to\nunderstand his affairs. They appeared to me to be quite beyond his\ncomprehension, for when Caddy took me into the dining-room by mistake\nand we came upon Mr. Jellyby in his spectacles, forlornly fenced into\na corner by the great dining-table and the two gentlemen, he seemed\nto have given up the whole thing and to be speechless and insensible.\n\nGoing upstairs to Mrs. Jellyby's room (the children were all\nscreaming in the kitchen, and there was no servant to be seen), we\nfound that lady in the midst of a voluminous correspondence, opening,\nreading, and sorting letters, with a great accumulation of torn\ncovers on the floor. She was so preoccupied that at first she did not\nknow me, though she sat looking at me with that curious, bright-eyed,\nfar-off look of hers.\n\n\"Ah! Miss Summerson!\" she said at last. \"I was thinking of something\nso different! I hope you are well. I am happy to see you. Mr.\nJarndyce and Miss Clare quite well?\"\n\nI hoped in return that Mr. Jellyby was quite well.\n\n\"Why, not quite, my dear,\" said Mrs. Jellyby in the calmest manner.\n\"He has been unfortunate in his affairs and is a little out of\nspirits. Happily for me, I am so much engaged that I have no time to\nthink about it. We have, at the present moment, one hundred and\nseventy families, Miss Summerson, averaging five persons in each,\neither gone or going to the left bank of the Niger.\"\n\nI thought of the one family so near us who were neither gone nor\ngoing to the left bank of the Niger, and wondered how she could be so\nplacid.\n\n\"You have brought Caddy back, I see,\" observed Mrs. Jellyby with a\nglance at her daughter. \"It has become quite a novelty to see her\nhere. She has almost deserted her old employment and in fact obliges\nme to employ a boy.\"\n\n\"I am sure, Ma--\" began Caddy.\n\n\"Now you know, Caddy,\" her mother mildly interposed, \"that I DO\nemploy a boy, who is now at his dinner. What is the use of your\ncontradicting?\"\n\n\"I was not going to contradict, Ma,\" returned Caddy. \"I was only\ngoing to say that surely you wouldn't have me be a mere drudge all my\nlife.\"\n\n\"I believe, my dear,\" said Mrs. Jellyby, still opening her letters,\ncasting her bright eyes smilingly over them, and sorting them as she\nspoke, \"that you have a business example before you in your mother.\nBesides. A mere drudge? If you had any sympathy with the destinies of\nthe human race, it would raise you high above any such idea. But you\nhave none. I have often told you, Caddy, you have no such sympathy.\"\n\n\"Not if it's Africa, Ma, I have not.\"\n\n\"Of course you have not. Now, if I were not happily so much engaged,\nMiss Summerson,\" said Mrs. Jellyby, sweetly casting her eyes for a\nmoment on me and considering where to put the particular letter she\nhad just opened, \"this would distress and disappoint me. But I have\nso much to think of, in connexion with Borrioboola-Gha and it is so\nnecessary I should concentrate myself that there is my remedy, you\nsee.\"\n\nAs Caddy gave me a glance of entreaty, and as Mrs. Jellyby was\nlooking far away into Africa straight through my bonnet and head, I\nthought it a good opportunity to come to the subject of my visit and\nto attract Mrs. Jellyby's attention.\n\n\"Perhaps,\" I began, \"you will wonder what has brought me here to\ninterrupt you.\"\n\n\"I am always delighted to see Miss Summerson,\" said Mrs. Jellyby,\npursuing her employment with a placid smile. \"Though I wish,\" and she\nshook her head, \"she was more interested in the Borrioboolan\nproject.\"\n\n\"I have come with Caddy,\" said I, \"because Caddy justly thinks she\nought not to have a secret from her mother and fancies I shall\nencourage and aid her (though I am sure I don't know how) in\nimparting one.\"\n\n\"Caddy,\" said Mrs. Jellyby, pausing for a moment in her occupation\nand then serenely pursuing it after shaking her head, \"you are going\nto tell me some nonsense.\"\n\nCaddy untied the strings of her bonnet, took her bonnet off, and\nletting it dangle on the floor by the strings, and crying heartily,\nsaid, \"Ma, I am engaged.\"\n\n\"Oh, you ridiculous child!\" observed Mrs. Jellyby with an abstracted\nair as she looked over the dispatch last opened; \"what a goose you\nare!\"\n\n\"I am engaged, Ma,\" sobbed Caddy, \"to young Mr. Turveydrop, at the\nacademy; and old Mr. Turveydrop (who is a very gentlemanly man\nindeed) has given his consent, and I beg and pray you'll give us\nyours, Ma, because I never could be happy without it. I never, never\ncould!\" sobbed Caddy, quite forgetful of her general complainings and\nof everything but her natural affection.\n\n\"You see again, Miss Summerson,\" observed Mrs. Jellyby serenely,\n\"what a happiness it is to be so much occupied as I am and to have\nthis necessity for self-concentration that I have. Here is Caddy\nengaged to a dancing-master's son--mixed up with people who have no\nmore sympathy with the destinies of the human race than she has\nherself! This, too, when Mr. Quale, one of the first philanthropists\nof our time, has mentioned to me that he was really disposed to be\ninterested in her!\"\n\n\"Ma, I always hated and detested Mr. Quale!\" sobbed Caddy.\n\n\"Caddy, Caddy!\" returned Mrs. Jellyby, opening another letter with\nthe greatest complacency. \"I have no doubt you did. How could you do\notherwise, being totally destitute of the sympathies with which he\noverflows! Now, if my public duties were not a favourite child to me,\nif I were not occupied with large measures on a vast scale, these\npetty details might grieve me very much, Miss Summerson. But can I\npermit the film of a silly proceeding on the part of Caddy (from whom\nI expect nothing else) to interpose between me and the great African\ncontinent? No. No,\" repeated Mrs. Jellyby in a calm clear voice, and\nwith an agreeable smile, as she opened more letters and sorted them.\n\"No, indeed.\"\n\nI was so unprepared for the perfect coolness of this reception,\nthough I might have expected it, that I did not know what to say.\nCaddy seemed equally at a loss. Mrs. Jellyby continued to open and\nsort letters and to repeat occasionally in quite a charming tone of\nvoice and with a smile of perfect composure, \"No, indeed.\"\n\n\"I hope, Ma,\" sobbed poor Caddy at last, \"you are not angry?\"\n\n\"Oh, Caddy, you really are an absurd girl,\" returned Mrs. Jellyby,\n\"to ask such questions after what I have said of the preoccupation of\nmy mind.\"\n\n\"And I hope, Ma, you give us your consent and wish us well?\" said\nCaddy.\n\n\"You are a nonsensical child to have done anything of this kind,\"\nsaid Mrs. Jellyby; \"and a degenerate child, when you might have\ndevoted yourself to the great public measure. But the step is taken,\nand I have engaged a boy, and there is no more to be said. Now, pray,\nCaddy,\" said Mrs. Jellyby, for Caddy was kissing her, \"don't delay me\nin my work, but let me clear off this heavy batch of papers before\nthe afternoon post comes in!\"\n\nI thought I could not do better than take my leave; I was detained\nfor a moment by Caddy's saying, \"You won't object to my bringing him\nto see you, Ma?\"\n\n\"Oh, dear me, Caddy,\" cried Mrs. Jellyby, who had relapsed into that\ndistant contemplation, \"have you begun again? Bring whom?\"\n\n\"Him, Ma.\"\n\n\"Caddy, Caddy!\" said Mrs. Jellyby, quite weary of such little\nmatters. \"Then you must bring him some evening which is not a Parent\nSociety night, or a Branch night, or a Ramification night. You must\naccommodate the visit to the demands upon my time. My dear Miss\nSummerson, it was very kind of you to come here to help out this\nsilly chit. Good-bye! When I tell you that I have fifty-eight new\nletters from manufacturing families anxious to understand the details\nof the native and coffee-cultivation question this morning, I need\nnot apologize for having very little leisure.\"\n\nI was not surprised by Caddy's being in low spirits when we went\ndownstairs, or by her sobbing afresh on my neck, or by her saying she\nwould far rather have been scolded than treated with such\nindifference, or by her confiding to me that she was so poor in\nclothes that how she was ever to be married creditably she didn't\nknow. I gradually cheered her up by dwelling on the many things she\nwould do for her unfortunate father and for Peepy when she had a home\nof her own; and finally we went downstairs into the damp dark\nkitchen, where Peepy and his little brothers and sisters were\ngrovelling on the stone floor and where we had such a game of play\nwith them that to prevent myself from being quite torn to pieces I\nwas obliged to fall back on my fairy-tales. From time to time I heard\nloud voices in the parlour overhead, and occasionally a violent\ntumbling about of the furniture. The last effect I am afraid was\ncaused by poor Mr. Jellyby's breaking away from the dining-table and\nmaking rushes at the window with the intention of throwing himself\ninto the area whenever he made any new attempt to understand his\naffairs.\n\nAs I rode quietly home at night after the day's bustle, I thought a\ngood deal of Caddy's engagement and felt confirmed in my hopes (in\nspite of the elder Mr. Turveydrop) that she would be the happier and\nbetter for it. And if there seemed to be but a slender chance of her\nand her husband ever finding out what the model of deportment really\nwas, why that was all for the best too, and who would wish them to be\nwiser? I did not wish them to be any wiser and indeed was half\nashamed of not entirely believing in him myself. And I looked up at\nthe stars, and thought about travellers in distant countries and the\nstars THEY saw, and hoped I might always be so blest and happy as to\nbe useful to some one in my small way.\n\nThey were so glad to see me when I got home, as they always were,\nthat I could have sat down and cried for joy if that had not been a\nmethod of making myself disagreeable. Everybody in the house, from\nthe lowest to the highest, showed me such a bright face of welcome,\nand spoke so cheerily, and was so happy to do anything for me, that I\nsuppose there never was such a fortunate little creature in the\nworld.\n\nWe got into such a chatty state that night, through Ada and my\nguardian drawing me out to tell them all about Caddy, that I went on\nprose, prose, prosing for a length of time. At last I got up to my\nown room, quite red to think how I had been holding forth, and then I\nheard a soft tap at my door. So I said, \"Come in!\" and there came in\na pretty little girl, neatly dressed in mourning, who dropped a\ncurtsy.\n\n\"If you please, miss,\" said the little girl in a soft voice, \"I am\nCharley.\"\n\n\"Why, so you are,\" said I, stooping down in astonishment and giving\nher a kiss. \"How glad am I to see you, Charley!\"\n\n\"If you please, miss,\" pursued Charley in the same soft voice, \"I'm\nyour maid.\"\n\n\"Charley?\"\n\n\"If you please, miss, I'm a present to you, with Mr. Jarndyce's\nlove.\"\n\nI sat down with my hand on Charley's neck and looked at Charley.\n\n\"And oh, miss,\" says Charley, clapping her hands, with the tears\nstarting down her dimpled cheeks, \"Tom's at school, if you please,\nand learning so good! And little Emma, she's with Mrs. Blinder, miss,\na-being took such care of! And Tom, he would have been at school--and\nEmma, she would have been left with Mrs. Blinder--and me, I should\nhave been here--all a deal sooner, miss; only Mr. Jarndyce thought\nthat Tom and Emma and me had better get a little used to parting\nfirst, we was so small. Don't cry, if you please, miss!\"\n\n\"I can't help it, Charley.\"\n\n\"No, miss, nor I can't help it,\" says Charley. \"And if you please,\nmiss, Mr. Jarndyce's love, and he thinks you'll like to teach me now\nand then. And if you please, Tom and Emma and me is to see each other\nonce a month. And I'm so happy and so thankful, miss,\" cried Charley\nwith a heaving heart, \"and I'll try to be such a good maid!\"\n\n\"Oh, Charley dear, never forget who did all this!\"\n\n\"No, miss, I never will. Nor Tom won't. Nor yet Emma. It was all you,\nmiss.\"\n\n\"I have known nothing of it. It was Mr. Jarndyce, Charley.\"\n\n\"Yes, miss, but it was all done for the love of you and that you\nmight be my mistress. If you please, miss, I am a little present with\nhis love, and it was all done for the love of you. Me and Tom was to\nbe sure to remember it.\"\n\nCharley dried her eyes and entered on her functions, going in her\nmatronly little way about and about the room and folding up\neverything she could lay her hands upon. Presently Charley came\ncreeping back to my side and said, \"Oh, don't cry, if you please,\nmiss.\"\n\nAnd I said again, \"I can't help it, Charley.\"\n\nAnd Charley said again, \"No, miss, nor I can't help it.\" And so,\nafter all, I did cry for joy indeed, and so did she.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIV\n\nAn Appeal Case\n\n\nAs soon as Richard and I had held the conversation of which I have\ngiven an account, Richard communicated the state of his mind to Mr.\nJarndyce. I doubt if my guardian were altogether taken by surprise\nwhen he received the representation, though it caused him much\nuneasiness and disappointment. He and Richard were often closeted\ntogether, late at night and early in the morning, and passed whole\ndays in London, and had innumerable appointments with Mr. Kenge, and\nlaboured through a quantity of disagreeable business. While they were\nthus employed, my guardian, though he underwent considerable\ninconvenience from the state of the wind and rubbed his head so\nconstantly that not a single hair upon it ever rested in its right\nplace, was as genial with Ada and me as at any other time, but\nmaintained a steady reserve on these matters. And as our utmost\nendeavours could only elicit from Richard himself sweeping assurances\nthat everything was going on capitally and that it really was all\nright at last, our anxiety was not much relieved by him.\n\nWe learnt, however, as the time went on, that a new application was\nmade to the Lord Chancellor on Richard's behalf as an infant and a\nward, and I don't know what, and that there was a quantity of\ntalking, and that the Lord Chancellor described him in open court as\na vexatious and capricious infant, and that the matter was adjourned\nand readjourned, and referred, and reported on, and petitioned about\nuntil Richard began to doubt (as he told us) whether, if he entered\nthe army at all, it would not be as a veteran of seventy or eighty\nyears of age. At last an appointment was made for him to see the Lord\nChancellor again in his private room, and there the Lord Chancellor\nvery seriously reproved him for trifling with time and not knowing\nhis mind--\"a pretty good joke, I think,\" said Richard, \"from that\nquarter!\"--and at last it was settled that his application should be\ngranted. His name was entered at the Horse Guards as an applicant for\nan ensign's commission; the purchase-money was deposited at an\nagent's; and Richard, in his usual characteristic way, plunged into a\nviolent course of military study and got up at five o'clock every\nmorning to practise the broadsword exercise.\n\nThus, vacation succeeded term, and term succeeded vacation. We\nsometimes heard of Jarndyce and Jarndyce as being in the paper or out\nof the paper, or as being to be mentioned, or as being to be spoken\nto; and it came on, and it went off. Richard, who was now in a\nprofessor's house in London, was able to be with us less frequently\nthan before; my guardian still maintained the same reserve; and so\ntime passed until the commission was obtained and Richard received\ndirections with it to join a regiment in Ireland.\n\nHe arrived post-haste with the intelligence one evening, and had a\nlong conference with my guardian. Upwards of an hour elapsed before\nmy guardian put his head into the room where Ada and I were sitting\nand said, \"Come in, my dears!\" We went in and found Richard, whom we\nhad last seen in high spirits, leaning on the chimney-piece looking\nmortified and angry.\n\n\"Rick and I, Ada,\" said Mr. Jarndyce, \"are not quite of one mind.\nCome, come, Rick, put a brighter face upon it!\"\n\n\"You are very hard with me, sir,\" said Richard. \"The harder because\nyou have been so considerate to me in all other respects and have\ndone me kindnesses that I can never acknowledge. I never could have\nbeen set right without you, sir.\"\n\n\"Well, well!\" said Mr. Jarndyce. \"I want to set you more right yet. I\nwant to set you more right with yourself.\"\n\n\"I hope you will excuse my saying, sir,\" returned Richard in a fiery\nway, but yet respectfully, \"that I think I am the best judge about\nmyself.\"\n\n\"I hope you will excuse my saying, my dear Rick,\" observed Mr.\nJarndyce with the sweetest cheerfulness and good humour, \"that it's\nquite natural in you to think so, but I don't think so. I must do my\nduty, Rick, or you could never care for me in cool blood; and I hope\nyou will always care for me, cool and hot.\"\n\nAda had turned so pale that he made her sit down in his reading-chair\nand sat beside her.\n\n\"It's nothing, my dear,\" he said, \"it's nothing. Rick and I have only\nhad a friendly difference, which we must state to you, for you are\nthe theme. Now you are afraid of what's coming.\"\n\n\"I am not indeed, cousin John,\" replied Ada with a smile, \"if it is\nto come from you.\"\n\n\"Thank you, my dear. Do you give me a minute's calm attention,\nwithout looking at Rick. And, little woman, do you likewise. My dear\ngirl,\" putting his hand on hers as it lay on the side of the\neasy-chair, \"you recollect the talk we had, we four when the little\nwoman told me of a little love affair?\"\n\n\"It is not likely that either Richard or I can ever forget your\nkindness that day, cousin John.\"\n\n\"I can never forget it,\" said Richard.\n\n\"And I can never forget it,\" said Ada.\n\n\"So much the easier what I have to say, and so much the easier for us\nto agree,\" returned my guardian, his face irradiated by the\ngentleness and honour of his heart. \"Ada, my bird, you should know\nthat Rick has now chosen his profession for the last time. All that\nhe has of certainty will be expended when he is fully equipped. He\nhas exhausted his resources and is bound henceforward to the tree he\nhas planted.\"\n\n\"Quite true that I have exhausted my present resources, and I am\nquite content to know it. But what I have of certainty, sir,\" said\nRichard, \"is not all I have.\"\n\n\"Rick, Rick!\" cried my guardian with a sudden terror in his manner,\nand in an altered voice, and putting up his hands as if he would have\nstopped his ears. \"For the love of God, don't found a hope or\nexpectation on the family curse! Whatever you do on this side the\ngrave, never give one lingering glance towards the horrible phantom\nthat has haunted us so many years. Better to borrow, better to beg,\nbetter to die!\"\n\nWe were all startled by the fervour of this warning. Richard bit his\nlip and held his breath, and glanced at me as if he felt, and knew\nthat I felt too, how much he needed it.\n\n\"Ada, my dear,\" said Mr. Jarndyce, recovering his cheerfulness,\n\"these are strong words of advice, but I live in Bleak House and have\nseen a sight here. Enough of that. All Richard had to start him in\nthe race of life is ventured. I recommend to him and you, for his\nsake and your own, that he should depart from us with the\nunderstanding that there is no sort of contract between you. I must\ngo further. I will be plain with you both. You were to confide freely\nin me, and I will confide freely in you. I ask you wholly to\nrelinquish, for the present, any tie but your relationship.\"\n\n\"Better to say at once, sir,\" returned Richard, \"that you renounce\nall confidence in me and that you advise Ada to do the same.\"\n\n\"Better to say nothing of the sort, Rick, because I don't mean it.\"\n\n\"You think I have begun ill, sir,\" retorted Richard. \"I HAVE, I\nknow.\"\n\n\"How I hoped you would begin, and how go on, I told you when we spoke\nof these things last,\" said Mr. Jarndyce in a cordial and encouraging\nmanner. \"You have not made that beginning yet, but there is a time\nfor all things, and yours is not gone by; rather, it is just now\nfully come. Make a clear beginning altogether. You two (very young,\nmy dears) are cousins. As yet, you are nothing more. What more may\ncome must come of being worked out, Rick, and no sooner.\"\n\n\"You are very hard with me, sir,\" said Richard. \"Harder than I could\nhave supposed you would be.\"\n\n\"My dear boy,\" said Mr. Jarndyce, \"I am harder with myself when I do\nanything that gives you pain. You have your remedy in your own hands.\nAda, it is better for him that he should be free and that there\nshould be no youthful engagement between you. Rick, it is better for\nher, much better; you owe it to her. Come! Each of you will do what\nis best for the other, if not what is best for yourselves.\"\n\n\"Why is it best, sir?\" returned Richard hastily. \"It was not when we\nopened our hearts to you. You did not say so then.\"\n\n\"I have had experience since. I don't blame you, Rick, but I have had\nexperience since.\"\n\n\"You mean of me, sir.\"\n\n\"Well! Yes, of both of you,\" said Mr. Jarndyce kindly. \"The time is\nnot come for your standing pledged to one another. It is not right,\nand I must not recognize it. Come, come, my young cousins, begin\nafresh! Bygones shall be bygones, and a new page turned for you to\nwrite your lives in.\"\n\nRichard gave an anxious glance at Ada but said nothing.\n\n\"I have avoided saying one word to either of you or to Esther,\" said\nMr. Jarndyce, \"until now, in order that we might be open as the day,\nand all on equal terms. I now affectionately advise, I now most\nearnestly entreat, you two to part as you came here. Leave all else\nto time, truth, and steadfastness. If you do otherwise, you will do\nwrong, and you will have made me do wrong in ever bringing you\ntogether.\"\n\nA long silence succeeded.\n\n\"Cousin Richard,\" said Ada then, raising her blue eyes tenderly to\nhis face, \"after what our cousin John has said, I think no choice is\nleft us. Your mind may be quite at ease about me, for you will leave\nme here under his care and will be sure that I can have nothing to\nwish for--quite sure if I guide myself by his advice. I--I don't\ndoubt, cousin Richard,\" said Ada, a little confused, \"that you are\nvery fond of me, and I--I don't think you will fall in love with\nanybody else. But I should like you to consider well about it too, as\nI should like you to be in all things very happy. You may trust in\nme, cousin Richard. I am not at all changeable; but I am not\nunreasonable, and should never blame you. Even cousins may be sorry\nto part; and in truth I am very, very sorry, Richard, though I know\nit's for your welfare. I shall always think of you affectionately,\nand often talk of you with Esther, and--and perhaps you will\nsometimes think a little of me, cousin Richard. So now,\" said Ada,\ngoing up to him and giving him her trembling hand, \"we are only\ncousins again, Richard--for the time perhaps--and I pray for a\nblessing on my dear cousin, wherever he goes!\"\n\nIt was strange to me that Richard should not be able to forgive my\nguardian for entertaining the very same opinion of him which he\nhimself had expressed of himself in much stronger terms to me. But it\nwas certainly the case. I observed with great regret that from this\nhour he never was as free and open with Mr. Jarndyce as he had been\nbefore. He had every reason given him to be so, but he was not; and\nsolely on his side, an estrangement began to arise between them.\n\nIn the business of preparation and equipment he soon lost himself,\nand even his grief at parting from Ada, who remained in Hertfordshire\nwhile he, Mr. Jarndyce, and I went up to London for a week. He\nremembered her by fits and starts, even with bursts of tears, and at\nsuch times would confide to me the heaviest self-reproaches. But in a\nfew minutes he would recklessly conjure up some undefinable means by\nwhich they were both to be made rich and happy for ever, and would\nbecome as gay as possible.\n\nIt was a busy time, and I trotted about with him all day long, buying\na variety of things of which he stood in need. Of the things he would\nhave bought if he had been left to his own ways I say nothing. He was\nperfectly confidential with me, and often talked so sensibly and\nfeelingly about his faults and his vigorous resolutions, and dwelt so\nmuch upon the encouragement he derived from these conversations that\nI could never have been tired if I had tried.\n\nThere used, in that week, to come backward and forward to our lodging\nto fence with Richard a person who had formerly been a cavalry\nsoldier; he was a fine bluff-looking man, of a frank free bearing,\nwith whom Richard had practised for some months. I heard so much\nabout him, not only from Richard, but from my guardian too, that I\nwas purposely in the room with my work one morning after breakfast\nwhen he came.\n\n\"Good morning, Mr. George,\" said my guardian, who happened to be\nalone with me. \"Mr. Carstone will be here directly. Meanwhile, Miss\nSummerson is very happy to see you, I know. Sit down.\"\n\nHe sat down, a little disconcerted by my presence, I thought, and\nwithout looking at me, drew his heavy sunburnt hand across and across\nhis upper lip.\n\n\"You are as punctual as the sun,\" said Mr. Jarndyce.\n\n\"Military time, sir,\" he replied. \"Force of habit. A mere habit in\nme, sir. I am not at all business-like.\"\n\n\"Yet you have a large establishment, too, I am told?\" said Mr.\nJarndyce.\n\n\"Not much of a one, sir. I keep a shooting gallery, but not much of a\none.\"\n\n\"And what kind of a shot and what kind of a swordsman do you make of\nMr. Carstone?\" said my guardian.\n\n\"Pretty good, sir,\" he replied, folding his arms upon his broad chest\nand looking very large. \"If Mr. Carstone was to give his full mind to\nit, he would come out very good.\"\n\n\"But he don't, I suppose?\" said my guardian.\n\n\"He did at first, sir, but not afterwards. Not his full mind. Perhaps\nhe has something else upon it--some young lady, perhaps.\" His bright\ndark eyes glanced at me for the first time.\n\n\"He has not me upon his mind, I assure you, Mr. George,\" said I,\nlaughing, \"though you seem to suspect me.\"\n\nHe reddened a little through his brown and made me a trooper's bow.\n\"No offence, I hope, miss. I am one of the roughs.\"\n\n\"Not at all,\" said I. \"I take it as a compliment.\"\n\nIf he had not looked at me before, he looked at me now in three or\nfour quick successive glances. \"I beg your pardon, sir,\" he said to\nmy guardian with a manly kind of diffidence, \"but you did me the\nhonour to mention the young lady's name--\"\n\n\"Miss Summerson.\"\n\n\"Miss Summerson,\" he repeated, and looked at me again.\n\n\"Do you know the name?\" I asked.\n\n\"No, miss. To my knowledge I never heard it. I thought I had seen you\nsomewhere.\"\n\n\"I think not,\" I returned, raising my head from my work to look at\nhim; and there was something so genuine in his speech and manner that\nI was glad of the opportunity. \"I remember faces very well.\"\n\n\"So do I, miss!\" he returned, meeting my look with the fullness of\nhis dark eyes and broad forehead. \"Humph! What set me off, now, upon\nthat!\"\n\nHis once more reddening through his brown and being disconcerted by\nhis efforts to remember the association brought my guardian to his\nrelief.\n\n\"Have you many pupils, Mr. George?\"\n\n\"They vary in their number, sir. Mostly they're but a small lot to\nlive by.\"\n\n\"And what classes of chance people come to practise at your gallery?\"\n\n\"All sorts, sir. Natives and foreigners. From gentlemen to\n'prentices. I have had Frenchwomen come, before now, and show\nthemselves dabs at pistol-shooting. Mad people out of number, of\ncourse, but THEY go everywhere where the doors stand open.\"\n\n\"People don't come with grudges and schemes of finishing their\npractice with live targets, I hope?\" said my guardian, smiling.\n\n\"Not much of that, sir, though that HAS happened. Mostly they come\nfor skill--or idleness. Six of one, and half-a-dozen of the other. I\nbeg your pardon,\" said Mr. George, sitting stiffly upright and\nsquaring an elbow on each knee, \"but I believe you're a Chancery\nsuitor, if I have heard correct?\"\n\n\"I am sorry to say I am.\"\n\n\"I have had one of YOUR compatriots in my time, sir.\"\n\n\"A Chancery suitor?\" returned my guardian. \"How was that?\"\n\n\"Why, the man was so badgered and worried and tortured by being\nknocked about from post to pillar, and from pillar to post,\" said Mr.\nGeorge, \"that he got out of sorts. I don't believe he had any idea of\ntaking aim at anybody, but he was in that condition of resentment and\nviolence that he would come and pay for fifty shots and fire away\ntill he was red hot. One day I said to him when there was nobody by\nand he had been talking to me angrily about his wrongs, 'If this\npractice is a safety-valve, comrade, well and good; but I don't\naltogether like your being so bent upon it in your present state of\nmind; I'd rather you took to something else.' I was on my guard for a\nblow, he was that passionate; but he received it in very good part\nand left off directly. We shook hands and struck up a sort of\nfriendship.\"\n\n\"What was that man?\" asked my guardian in a new tone of interest.\n\n\"Why, he began by being a small Shropshire farmer before they made a\nbaited bull of him,\" said Mr. George.\n\n\"Was his name Gridley?\"\n\n\"It was, sir.\"\n\nMr. George directed another succession of quick bright glances at me\nas my guardian and I exchanged a word or two of surprise at the\ncoincidence, and I therefore explained to him how we knew the name.\nHe made me another of his soldierly bows in acknowledgment of what he\ncalled my condescension.\n\n\"I don't know,\" he said as he looked at me, \"what it is that sets me\noff again--but--bosh! What's my head running against!\" He passed one\nof his heavy hands over his crisp dark hair as if to sweep the broken\nthoughts out of his mind and sat a little forward, with one arm\nakimbo and the other resting on his leg, looking in a brown study at\nthe ground.\n\n\"I am sorry to learn that the same state of mind has got this Gridley\ninto new troubles and that he is in hiding,\" said my guardian.\n\n\"So I am told, sir,\" returned Mr. George, still musing and looking on\nthe ground. \"So I am told.\"\n\n\"You don't know where?\"\n\n\"No, sir,\" returned the trooper, lifting up his eyes and coming out\nof his reverie. \"I can't say anything about him. He will be worn out\nsoon, I expect. You may file a strong man's heart away for a good\nmany years, but it will tell all of a sudden at last.\"\n\nRichard's entrance stopped the conversation. Mr. George rose, made me\nanother of his soldierly bows, wished my guardian a good day, and\nstrode heavily out of the room.\n\nThis was the morning of the day appointed for Richard's departure. We\nhad no more purchases to make now; I had completed all his packing\nearly in the afternoon; and our time was disengaged until night, when\nhe was to go to Liverpool for Holyhead. Jarndyce and Jarndyce being\nagain expected to come on that day, Richard proposed to me that we\nshould go down to the court and hear what passed. As it was his last\nday, and he was eager to go, and I had never been there, I gave my\nconsent and we walked down to Westminster, where the court was then\nsitting. We beguiled the way with arrangements concerning the letters\nthat Richard was to write to me and the letters that I was to write\nto him and with a great many hopeful projects. My guardian knew where\nwe were going and therefore was not with us.\n\nWhen we came to the court, there was the Lord Chancellor--the same\nwhom I had seen in his private room in Lincoln's Inn--sitting in\ngreat state and gravity on the bench, with the mace and seals on a\nred table below him and an immense flat nosegay, like a little\ngarden, which scented the whole court. Below the table, again, was a\nlong row of solicitors, with bundles of papers on the matting at\ntheir feet; and then there were the gentlemen of the bar in wigs and\ngowns--some awake and some asleep, and one talking, and nobody paying\nmuch attention to what he said. The Lord Chancellor leaned back in\nhis very easy chair with his elbow on the cushioned arm and his\nforehead resting on his hand; some of those who were present dozed;\nsome read the newspapers; some walked about or whispered in groups:\nall seemed perfectly at their ease, by no means in a hurry, very\nunconcerned, and extremely comfortable.\n\nTo see everything going on so smoothly and to think of the roughness\nof the suitors' lives and deaths; to see all that full dress and\nceremony and to think of the waste, and want, and beggared misery it\nrepresented; to consider that while the sickness of hope deferred was\nraging in so many hearts this polite show went calmly on from day to\nday, and year to year, in such good order and composure; to behold\nthe Lord Chancellor and the whole array of practitioners under him\nlooking at one another and at the spectators as if nobody had ever\nheard that all over England the name in which they were assembled was\na bitter jest, was held in universal horror, contempt, and\nindignation, was known for something so flagrant and bad that little\nshort of a miracle could bring any good out of it to any one--this\nwas so curious and self-contradictory to me, who had no experience of\nit, that it was at first incredible, and I could not comprehend it. I\nsat where Richard put me, and tried to listen, and looked about me;\nbut there seemed to be no reality in the whole scene except poor\nlittle Miss Flite, the madwoman, standing on a bench and nodding at\nit.\n\nMiss Flite soon espied us and came to where we sat. She gave me a\ngracious welcome to her domain and indicated, with much gratification\nand pride, its principal attractions. Mr. Kenge also came to speak to\nus and did the honours of the place in much the same way, with the\nbland modesty of a proprietor. It was not a very good day for a\nvisit, he said; he would have preferred the first day of term; but it\nwas imposing, it was imposing.\n\nWhen we had been there half an hour or so, the case in progress--if I\nmay use a phrase so ridiculous in such a connexion--seemed to die out\nof its own vapidity, without coming, or being by anybody expected to\ncome, to any result. The Lord Chancellor then threw down a bundle of\npapers from his desk to the gentlemen below him, and somebody said,\n\"Jarndyce and Jarndyce.\" Upon this there was a buzz, and a laugh, and\na general withdrawal of the bystanders, and a bringing in of great\nheaps, and piles, and bags and bags full of papers.\n\nI think it came on \"for further directions\"--about some bill of\ncosts, to the best of my understanding, which was confused enough.\nBut I counted twenty-three gentlemen in wigs who said they were \"in\nit,\" and none of them appeared to understand it much better than I.\nThey chatted about it with the Lord Chancellor, and contradicted and\nexplained among themselves, and some of them said it was this way,\nand some of them said it was that way, and some of them jocosely\nproposed to read huge volumes of affidavits, and there was more\nbuzzing and laughing, and everybody concerned was in a state of idle\nentertainment, and nothing could be made of it by anybody. After an\nhour or so of this, and a good many speeches being begun and cut\nshort, it was \"referred back for the present,\" as Mr. Kenge said, and\nthe papers were bundled up again before the clerks had finished\nbringing them in.\n\nI glanced at Richard on the termination of these hopeless proceedings\nand was shocked to see the worn look of his handsome young face. \"It\ncan't last for ever, Dame Durden. Better luck next time!\" was all he\nsaid.\n\nI had seen Mr. Guppy bringing in papers and arranging them for Mr.\nKenge; and he had seen me and made me a forlorn bow, which rendered\nme desirous to get out of the court. Richard had given me his arm and\nwas taking me away when Mr. Guppy came up.\n\n\"I beg your pardon, Mr. Carstone,\" said he in a whisper, \"and Miss\nSummerson's also, but there's a lady here, a friend of mine, who\nknows her and wishes to have the pleasure of shaking hands.\" As he\nspoke, I saw before me, as if she had started into bodily shape from\nmy remembrance, Mrs. Rachael of my godmother's house.\n\n\"How do you do, Esther?\" said she. \"Do you recollect me?\"\n\nI gave her my hand and told her yes and that she was very little\naltered.\n\n\"I wonder you remember those times, Esther,\" she returned with her\nold asperity. \"They are changed now. Well! I am glad to see you, and\nglad you are not too proud to know me.\" But indeed she seemed\ndisappointed that I was not.\n\n\"Proud, Mrs. Rachael!\" I remonstrated.\n\n\"I am married, Esther,\" she returned, coldly correcting me, \"and am\nMrs. Chadband. Well! I wish you good day, and I hope you'll do well.\"\n\nMr. Guppy, who had been attentive to this short dialogue, heaved a\nsigh in my ear and elbowed his own and Mrs. Rachael's way through the\nconfused little crowd of people coming in and going out, which we\nwere in the midst of and which the change in the business had brought\ntogether. Richard and I were making our way through it, and I was yet\nin the first chill of the late unexpected recognition when I saw,\ncoming towards us, but not seeing us, no less a person than Mr.\nGeorge. He made nothing of the people about him as he tramped on,\nstaring over their heads into the body of the court.\n\n\"George!\" said Richard as I called his attention to him.\n\n\"You are well met, sir,\" he returned. \"And you, miss. Could you point\na person out for me, I want? I don't understand these places.\"\n\nTurning as he spoke and making an easy way for us, he stopped when we\nwere out of the press in a corner behind a great red curtain.\n\n\"There's a little cracked old woman,\" he began, \"that--\"\n\nI put up my finger, for Miss Flite was close by me, having kept\nbeside me all the time and having called the attention of several of\nher legal acquaintance to me (as I had overheard to my confusion) by\nwhispering in their ears, \"Hush! Fitz Jarndyce on my left!\"\n\n\"Hem!\" said Mr. George. \"You remember, miss, that we passed some\nconversation on a certain man this morning? Gridley,\" in a low\nwhisper behind his hand.\n\n\"Yes,\" said I.\n\n\"He is hiding at my place. I couldn't mention it. Hadn't his\nauthority. He is on his last march, miss, and has a whim to see her.\nHe says they can feel for one another, and she has been almost as\ngood as a friend to him here. I came down to look for her, for when I\nsat by Gridley this afternoon, I seemed to hear the roll of the\nmuffled drums.\"\n\n\"Shall I tell her?\" said I.\n\n\"Would you be so good?\" he returned with a glance of something like\napprehension at Miss Flite. \"It's a providence I met you, miss; I\ndoubt if I should have known how to get on with that lady.\" And he\nput one hand in his breast and stood upright in a martial attitude as\nI informed little Miss Flite, in her ear, of the purport of his kind\nerrand.\n\n\"My angry friend from Shropshire! Almost as celebrated as myself!\"\nshe exclaimed. \"Now really! My dear, I will wait upon him with the\ngreatest pleasure.\"\n\n\"He is living concealed at Mr. George's,\" said I. \"Hush! This is Mr.\nGeorge.\"\n\n\"In--deed!\" returned Miss Flite. \"Very proud to have the honour! A\nmilitary man, my dear. You know, a perfect general!\" she whispered to\nme.\n\nPoor Miss Flite deemed it necessary to be so courtly and polite, as a\nmark of her respect for the army, and to curtsy so very often that it\nwas no easy matter to get her out of the court. When this was at last\ndone, and addressing Mr. George as \"General,\" she gave him her arm,\nto the great entertainment of some idlers who were looking on, he was\nso discomposed and begged me so respectfully \"not to desert him\" that\nI could not make up my mind to do it, especially as Miss Flite was\nalways tractable with me and as she too said, \"Fitz Jarndyce, my\ndear, you will accompany us, of course.\" As Richard seemed quite\nwilling, and even anxious, that we should see them safely to their\ndestination, we agreed to do so. And as Mr. George informed us that\nGridley's mind had run on Mr. Jarndyce all the afternoon after\nhearing of their interview in the morning, I wrote a hasty note in\npencil to my guardian to say where we were gone and why. Mr. George\nsealed it at a coffee-house, that it might lead to no discovery, and\nwe sent it off by a ticket-porter.\n\nWe then took a hackney-coach and drove away to the neighbourhood of\nLeicester Square. We walked through some narrow courts, for which Mr.\nGeorge apologized, and soon came to the shooting gallery, the door of\nwhich was closed. As he pulled a bell-handle which hung by a chain to\nthe door-post, a very respectable old gentleman with grey hair,\nwearing spectacles, and dressed in a black spencer and gaiters and a\nbroad-brimmed hat, and carrying a large gold-beaded cane, addressed\nhim.\n\n\"I ask your pardon, my good friend,\" said he, \"but is this George's\nShooting Gallery?\"\n\n\"It is, sir,\" returned Mr. George, glancing up at the great letters\nin which that inscription was painted on the whitewashed wall.\n\n\"Oh! To be sure!\" said the old gentleman, following his eyes. \"Thank\nyou. Have you rung the bell?\"\n\n\"My name is George, sir, and I have rung the bell.\"\n\n\"Oh, indeed?\" said the old gentleman. \"Your name is George? Then I am\nhere as soon as you, you see. You came for me, no doubt?\"\n\n\"No, sir. You have the advantage of me.\"\n\n\"Oh, indeed?\" said the old gentleman. \"Then it was your young man who\ncame for me. I am a physician and was requested--five minutes ago--to\ncome and visit a sick man at George's Shooting Gallery.\"\n\n\"The muffled drums,\" said Mr. George, turning to Richard and me and\ngravely shaking his head. \"It's quite correct, sir. Will you please\nto walk in.\"\n\nThe door being at that moment opened by a very singular-looking\nlittle man in a green-baize cap and apron, whose face and hands and\ndress were blackened all over, we passed along a dreary passage into\na large building with bare brick walls where there were targets, and\nguns, and swords, and other things of that kind. When we had all\narrived here, the physician stopped, and taking off his hat, appeared\nto vanish by magic and to leave another and quite a different man in\nhis place.\n\n\"Now lookee here, George,\" said the man, turning quickly round upon\nhim and tapping him on the breast with a large forefinger. \"You know\nme, and I know you. You're a man of the world, and I'm a man of the\nworld. My name's Bucket, as you are aware, and I have got a\npeace-warrant against Gridley. You have kept him out of the way a\nlong time, and you have been artful in it, and it does you credit.\"\n\nMr. George, looking hard at him, bit his lip and shook his head.\n\n\"Now, George,\" said the other, keeping close to him, \"you're a\nsensible man and a well-conducted man; that's what YOU are, beyond a\ndoubt. And mind you, I don't talk to you as a common character,\nbecause you have served your country and you know that when duty\ncalls we must obey. Consequently you're very far from wanting to give\ntrouble. If I required assistance, you'd assist me; that's what YOU'D\ndo. Phil Squod, don't you go a-sidling round the gallery like\nthat\"--the dirty little man was shuffling about with his shoulder\nagainst the wall, and his eyes on the intruder, in a manner that\nlooked threatening--\"because I know you and won't have it.\"\n\n\"Phil!\" said Mr. George.\n\n\"Yes, guv'ner.\"\n\n\"Be quiet.\"\n\nThe little man, with a low growl, stood still.\n\n\"Ladies and gentlemen,\" said Mr. Bucket, \"you'll excuse anything that\nmay appear to be disagreeable in this, for my name's Inspector Bucket\nof the Detective, and I have a duty to perform. George, I know where\nmy man is because I was on the roof last night and saw him through\nthe skylight, and you along with him. He is in there, you know,\"\npointing; \"that's where HE is--on a sofy. Now I must see my man, and\nI must tell my man to consider himself in custody; but you know me,\nand you know I don't want to take any uncomfortable measures. You\ngive me your word, as from one man to another (and an old soldier,\nmind you, likewise), that it's honourable between us two, and I'll\naccommodate you to the utmost of my power.\"\n\n\"I give it,\" was the reply. \"But it wasn't handsome in you, Mr.\nBucket.\"\n\n\"Gammon, George! Not handsome?\" said Mr. Bucket, tapping him on his\nbroad breast again and shaking hands with him. \"I don't say it wasn't\nhandsome in you to keep my man so close, do I? Be equally\ngood-tempered to me, old boy! Old William Tell, Old Shaw, the Life\nGuardsman! Why, he's a model of the whole British army in himself,\nladies and gentlemen. I'd give a fifty-pun' note to be such a figure\nof a man!\"\n\nThe affair being brought to this head, Mr. George, after a little\nconsideration, proposed to go in first to his comrade (as he called\nhim), taking Miss Flite with him. Mr. Bucket agreeing, they went away\nto the further end of the gallery, leaving us sitting and standing by\na table covered with guns. Mr. Bucket took this opportunity of\nentering into a little light conversation, asking me if I were afraid\nof fire-arms, as most young ladies were; asking Richard if he were a\ngood shot; asking Phil Squod which he considered the best of those\nrifles and what it might be worth first-hand, telling him in return\nthat it was a pity he ever gave way to his temper, for he was\nnaturally so amiable that he might have been a young woman, and\nmaking himself generally agreeable.\n\nAfter a time he followed us to the further end of the gallery, and\nRichard and I were going quietly away when Mr. George came after us.\nHe said that if we had no objection to see his comrade, he would take\na visit from us very kindly. The words had hardly passed his lips\nwhen the bell was rung and my guardian appeared, \"on the chance,\" he\nslightly observed, \"of being able to do any little thing for a poor\nfellow involved in the same misfortune as himself.\" We all four went\nback together and went into the place where Gridley was.\n\nIt was a bare room, partitioned off from the gallery with unpainted\nwood. As the screening was not more than eight or ten feet high and\nonly enclosed the sides, not the top, the rafters of the high gallery\nroof were overhead, and the skylight through which Mr. Bucket had\nlooked down. The sun was low--near setting--and its light came redly\nin above, without descending to the ground. Upon a plain\ncanvas-covered sofa lay the man from Shropshire, dressed much as we\nhad seen him last, but so changed that at first I recognized no\nlikeness in his colourless face to what I recollected.\n\nHe had been still writing in his hiding-place, and still dwelling on\nhis grievances, hour after hour. A table and some shelves were\ncovered with manuscript papers and with worn pens and a medley of\nsuch tokens. Touchingly and awfully drawn together, he and the little\nmad woman were side by side and, as it were, alone. She sat on a\nchair holding his hand, and none of us went close to them.\n\nHis voice had faded, with the old expression of his face, with his\nstrength, with his anger, with his resistance to the wrongs that had\nat last subdued him. The faintest shadow of an object full of form\nand colour is such a picture of it as he was of the man from\nShropshire whom we had spoken with before.\n\nHe inclined his head to Richard and me and spoke to my guardian.\n\n\"Mr. Jarndyce, it is very kind of you to come to see me. I am not\nlong to be seen, I think. I am very glad to take your hand, sir. You\nare a good man, superior to injustice, and God knows I honour you.\"\n\nThey shook hands earnestly, and my guardian said some words of\ncomfort to him.\n\n\"It may seem strange to you, sir,\" returned Gridley; \"I should not\nhave liked to see you if this had been the first time of our meeting.\nBut you know I made a fight for it, you know I stood up with my\nsingle hand against them all, you know I told them the truth to the\nlast, and told them what they were, and what they had done to me; so\nI don't mind your seeing me, this wreck.\"\n\n\"You have been courageous with them many and many a time,\" returned\nmy guardian.\n\n\"Sir, I have been,\" with a faint smile. \"I told you what would come\nof it when I ceased to be so, and see here! Look at us--look at us!\"\nHe drew the hand Miss Flite held through her arm and brought her\nsomething nearer to him.\n\n\"This ends it. Of all my old associations, of all my old pursuits and\nhopes, of all the living and the dead world, this one poor soul alone\ncomes natural to me, and I am fit for. There is a tie of many\nsuffering years between us two, and it is the only tie I ever had on\nearth that Chancery has not broken.\"\n\n\"Accept my blessing, Gridley,\" said Miss Flite in tears. \"Accept my\nblessing!\"\n\n\"I thought, boastfully, that they never could break my heart, Mr.\nJarndyce. I was resolved that they should not. I did believe that I\ncould, and would, charge them with being the mockery they were until\nI died of some bodily disorder. But I am worn out. How long I have\nbeen wearing out, I don't know; I seemed to break down in an hour. I\nhope they may never come to hear of it. I hope everybody here will\nlead them to believe that I died defying them, consistently and\nperseveringly, as I did through so many years.\"\n\nHere Mr. Bucket, who was sitting in a corner by the door,\ngood-naturedly offered such consolation as he could administer.\n\n\"Come, come!\" he said from his corner. \"Don't go on in that way, Mr.\nGridley. You are only a little low. We are all of us a little low\nsometimes. I am. Hold up, hold up! You'll lose your temper with the\nwhole round of 'em, again and again; and I shall take you on a score\nof warrants yet, if I have luck.\"\n\nHe only shook his head.\n\n\"Don't shake your head,\" said Mr. Bucket. \"Nod it; that's what I want\nto see you do. Why, Lord bless your soul, what times we have had\ntogether! Haven't I seen you in the Fleet over and over again for\ncontempt? Haven't I come into court, twenty afternoons for no other\npurpose than to see you pin the Chancellor like a bull-dog? Don't you\nremember when you first began to threaten the lawyers, and the peace\nwas sworn against you two or three times a week? Ask the little old\nlady there; she has been always present. Hold up, Mr. Gridley, hold\nup, sir!\"\n\n\"What are you going to do about him?\" asked George in a low voice.\n\n\"I don't know yet,\" said Bucket in the same tone. Then resuming his\nencouragement, he pursued aloud: \"Worn out, Mr. Gridley? After\ndodging me for all these weeks and forcing me to climb the roof here\nlike a tom cat and to come to see you as a doctor? That ain't like\nbeing worn out. I should think not! Now I tell you what you want. You\nwant excitement, you know, to keep YOU up; that's what YOU want.\nYou're used to it, and you can't do without it. I couldn't myself.\nVery well, then; here's this warrant got by Mr. Tulkinghorn of\nLincoln's Inn Fields, and backed into half-a-dozen counties since.\nWhat do you say to coming along with me, upon this warrant, and\nhaving a good angry argument before the magistrates? It'll do you\ngood; it'll freshen you up and get you into training for another turn\nat the Chancellor. Give in? Why, I am surprised to hear a man of your\nenergy talk of giving in. You mustn't do that. You're half the fun of\nthe fair in the Court of Chancery. George, you lend Mr. Gridley a\nhand, and let's see now whether he won't be better up than down.\"\n\n\"He is very weak,\" said the trooper in a low voice.\n\n\"Is he?\" returned Bucket anxiously. \"I only want to rouse him. I\ndon't like to see an old acquaintance giving in like this. It would\ncheer him up more than anything if I could make him a little waxy\nwith me. He's welcome to drop into me, right and left, if he likes. I\nshall never take advantage of it.\"\n\nThe roof rang with a scream from Miss Flite, which still rings in my\nears.\n\n\"Oh, no, Gridley!\" she cried as he fell heavily and calmly back from\nbefore her. \"Not without my blessing. After so many years!\"\n\nThe sun was down, the light had gradually stolen from the roof, and\nthe shadow had crept upward. But to me the shadow of that pair, one\nliving and one dead, fell heavier on Richard's departure than the\ndarkness of the darkest night. And through Richard's farewell words I\nheard it echoed: \"Of all my old associations, of all my old pursuits\nand hopes, of all the living and the dead world, this one poor soul\nalone comes natural to me, and I am fit for. There is a tie of many\nsuffering years between us two, and it is the only tie I ever had on\nearth that Chancery has not broken!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXV\n\nMrs. Snagsby Sees It All\n\n\nThere is disquietude in Cook's Court, Cursitor Street. Black\nsuspicion hides in that peaceful region. The mass of Cook's Courtiers\nare in their usual state of mind, no better and no worse; but Mr.\nSnagsby is changed, and his little woman knows it.\n\nFor Tom-all-Alone's and Lincoln's Inn Fields persist in harnessing\nthemselves, a pair of ungovernable coursers, to the chariot of Mr.\nSnagsby's imagination; and Mr. Bucket drives; and the passengers are\nJo and Mr. Tulkinghorn; and the complete equipage whirls though the\nlaw-stationery business at wild speed all round the clock. Even in\nthe little front kitchen where the family meals are taken, it rattles\naway at a smoking pace from the dinner-table, when Mr. Snagsby pauses\nin carving the first slice of the leg of mutton baked with potatoes\nand stares at the kitchen wall.\n\nMr. Snagsby cannot make out what it is that he has had to do with.\nSomething is wrong somewhere, but what something, what may come of\nit, to whom, when, and from which unthought of and unheard of quarter\nis the puzzle of his life. His remote impressions of the robes and\ncoronets, the stars and garters, that sparkle through the\nsurface-dust of Mr. Tulkinghorn's chambers; his veneration for the\nmysteries presided over by that best and closest of his customers,\nwhom all the Inns of Court, all Chancery Lane, and all the legal\nneighbourhood agree to hold in awe; his remembrance of Detective Mr.\nBucket with his forefinger and his confidential manner, impossible to\nbe evaded or declined, persuade him that he is a party to some\ndangerous secret without knowing what it is. And it is the fearful\npeculiarity of this condition that, at any hour of his daily life, at\nany opening of the shop-door, at any pull of the bell, at any\nentrance of a messenger, or any delivery of a letter, the secret may\ntake air and fire, explode, and blow up--Mr. Bucket only knows whom.\n\nFor which reason, whenever a man unknown comes into the shop (as many\nmen unknown do) and says, \"Is Mr. Snagsby in?\" or words to that\ninnocent effect, Mr. Snagsby's heart knocks hard at his guilty\nbreast. He undergoes so much from such inquiries that when they are\nmade by boys he revenges himself by flipping at their ears over the\ncounter and asking the young dogs what they mean by it and why they\ncan't speak out at once? More impracticable men and boys persist in\nwalking into Mr. Snagsby's sleep and terrifying him with\nunaccountable questions, so that often when the cock at the little\ndairy in Cursitor Street breaks out in his usual absurd way about the\nmorning, Mr. Snagsby finds himself in a crisis of nightmare, with his\nlittle woman shaking him and saying \"What's the matter with the man!\"\n\nThe little woman herself is not the least item in his difficulty. To\nknow that he is always keeping a secret from her, that he has under\nall circumstances to conceal and hold fast a tender double tooth,\nwhich her sharpness is ever ready to twist out of his head, gives Mr.\nSnagsby, in her dentistical presence, much of the air of a dog who\nhas a reservation from his master and will look anywhere rather than\nmeet his eye.\n\nThese various signs and tokens, marked by the little woman, are not\nlost upon her. They impel her to say, \"Snagsby has something on his\nmind!\" And thus suspicion gets into Cook's Court, Cursitor Street.\nFrom suspicion to jealousy, Mrs. Snagsby finds the road as natural\nand short as from Cook's Court to Chancery Lane. And thus jealousy\ngets into Cook's Court, Cursitor Street. Once there (and it was\nalways lurking thereabout), it is very active and nimble in Mrs.\nSnagsby's breast, prompting her to nocturnal examinations of Mr.\nSnagsby's pockets; to secret perusals of Mr. Snagsby's letters; to\nprivate researches in the day book and ledger, till, cash-box, and\niron safe; to watchings at windows, listenings behind doors, and a\ngeneral putting of this and that together by the wrong end.\n\nMrs. Snagsby is so perpetually on the alert that the house becomes\nghostly with creaking boards and rustling garments. The 'prentices\nthink somebody may have been murdered there in bygone times. Guster\nholds certain loose atoms of an idea (picked up at Tooting, where\nthey were found floating among the orphans) that there is buried\nmoney underneath the cellar, guarded by an old man with a white\nbeard, who cannot get out for seven thousand years because he said\nthe Lord's Prayer backwards.\n\n\"Who was Nimrod?\" Mrs. Snagsby repeatedly inquires of herself. \"Who\nwas that lady--that creature? And who is that boy?\" Now, Nimrod being\nas dead as the mighty hunter whose name Mrs. Snagsby has\nappropriated, and the lady being unproducible, she directs her mental\neye, for the present, with redoubled vigilance to the boy. \"And who,\"\nquoth Mrs. Snagsby for the thousand and first time, \"is that boy? Who\nis that--!\" And there Mrs. Snagsby is seized with an inspiration.\n\nHe has no respect for Mr. Chadband. No, to be sure, and he wouldn't\nhave, of course. Naturally he wouldn't, under those contagious\ncircumstances. He was invited and appointed by Mr. Chadband--why,\nMrs. Snagsby heard it herself with her own ears!--to come back, and\nbe told where he was to go, to be addressed by Mr. Chadband; and he\nnever came! Why did he never come? Because he was told not to come.\nWho told him not to come? Who? Ha, ha! Mrs. Snagsby sees it all.\n\nBut happily (and Mrs. Snagsby tightly shakes her head and tightly\nsmiles) that boy was met by Mr. Chadband yesterday in the streets;\nand that boy, as affording a subject which Mr. Chadband desires to\nimprove for the spiritual delight of a select congregation, was\nseized by Mr. Chadband and threatened with being delivered over to\nthe police unless he showed the reverend gentleman where he lived and\nunless he entered into, and fulfilled, an undertaking to appear in\nCook's Court to-morrow night, \"to--mor--row--night,\" Mrs. Snagsby\nrepeats for mere emphasis with another tight smile and another tight\nshake of her head; and to-morrow night that boy will be here, and\nto-morrow night Mrs. Snagsby will have her eye upon him and upon some\none else; and oh, you may walk a long while in your secret ways (says\nMrs. Snagsby with haughtiness and scorn), but you can't blind ME!\n\nMrs. Snagsby sounds no timbrel in anybody's ears, but holds her\npurpose quietly, and keeps her counsel. To-morrow comes, the savoury\npreparations for the Oil Trade come, the evening comes. Comes Mr.\nSnagsby in his black coat; come the Chadbands; come (when the gorging\nvessel is replete) the 'prentices and Guster, to be edified; comes at\nlast, with his slouching head, and his shuffle backward, and his\nshuffle forward, and his shuffle to the right, and his shuffle to the\nleft, and his bit of fur cap in his muddy hand, which he picks as if\nit were some mangy bird he had caught and was plucking before eating\nraw, Jo, the very, very tough subject Mr. Chadband is to improve.\n\nMrs. Snagsby screws a watchful glance on Jo as he is brought into the\nlittle drawing-room by Guster. He looks at Mr. Snagsby the moment he\ncomes in. Aha! Why does he look at Mr. Snagsby? Mr. Snagsby looks at\nhim. Why should he do that, but that Mrs. Snagsby sees it all? Why\nelse should that look pass between them, why else should Mr. Snagsby\nbe confused and cough a signal cough behind his hand? It is as clear\nas crystal that Mr. Snagsby is that boy's father.\n\n\"Peace, my friends,\" says Chadband, rising and wiping the oily\nexudations from his reverend visage. \"Peace be with us! My friends,\nwhy with us? Because,\" with his fat smile, \"it cannot be against us,\nbecause it must be for us; because it is not hardening, because it is\nsoftening; because it does not make war like the hawk, but comes home\nunto us like the dove. Therefore, my friends, peace be with us! My\nhuman boy, come forward!\"\n\nStretching forth his flabby paw, Mr. Chadband lays the same on Jo's\narm and considers where to station him. Jo, very doubtful of his\nreverend friend's intentions and not at all clear but that something\npractical and painful is going to be done to him, mutters, \"You let\nme alone. I never said nothink to you. You let me alone.\"\n\n\"No, my young friend,\" says Chadband smoothly, \"I will not let you\nalone. And why? Because I am a harvest-labourer, because I am a\ntoiler and a moiler, because you are delivered over unto me and are\nbecome as a precious instrument in my hands. My friends, may I so\nemploy this instrument as to use it to your advantage, to your\nprofit, to your gain, to your welfare, to your enrichment! My young\nfriend, sit upon this stool.\"\n\nJo, apparently possessed by an impression that the reverend gentleman\nwants to cut his hair, shields his head with both arms and is got\ninto the required position with great difficulty and every possible\nmanifestation of reluctance.\n\nWhen he is at last adjusted like a lay-figure, Mr. Chadband, retiring\nbehind the table, holds up his bear's-paw and says, \"My friends!\"\nThis is the signal for a general settlement of the audience. The\n'prentices giggle internally and nudge each other. Guster falls into\na staring and vacant state, compounded of a stunned admiration of Mr.\nChadband and pity for the friendless outcast whose condition touches\nher nearly. Mrs. Snagsby silently lays trains of gunpowder. Mrs.\nChadband composes herself grimly by the fire and warms her knees,\nfinding that sensation favourable to the reception of eloquence.\n\nIt happens that Mr. Chadband has a pulpit habit of fixing some member\nof his congregation with his eye and fatly arguing his points with\nthat particular person, who is understood to be expected to be moved\nto an occasional grunt, groan, gasp, or other audible expression of\ninward working, which expression of inward working, being echoed by\nsome elderly lady in the next pew and so communicated like a game of\nforfeits through a circle of the more fermentable sinners present,\nserves the purpose of parliamentary cheering and gets Mr. Chadband's\nsteam up. From mere force of habit, Mr. Chadband in saying \"My\nfriends!\" has rested his eye on Mr. Snagsby and proceeds to make that\nill-starred stationer, already sufficiently confused, the immediate\nrecipient of his discourse.\n\n\"We have here among us, my friends,\" says Chadband, \"a Gentile and a\nheathen, a dweller in the tents of Tom-all-Alone's and a mover-on\nupon the surface of the earth. We have here among us, my friends,\"\nand Mr. Chadband, untwisting the point with his dirty thumb-nail,\nbestows an oily smile on Mr. Snagsby, signifying that he will throw\nhim an argumentative back-fall presently if he be not already down,\n\"a brother and a boy. Devoid of parents, devoid of relations, devoid\nof flocks and herds, devoid of gold and silver and of precious\nstones. Now, my friends, why do I say he is devoid of these\npossessions? Why? Why is he?\" Mr. Chadband states the question as if\nhe were propounding an entirely new riddle of much ingenuity and\nmerit to Mr. Snagsby and entreating him not to give it up.\n\nMr. Snagsby, greatly perplexed by the mysterious look he received\njust now from his little woman--at about the period when Mr. Chadband\nmentioned the word parents--is tempted into modestly remarking, \"I\ndon't know, I'm sure, sir.\" On which interruption Mrs. Chadband\nglares and Mrs. Snagsby says, \"For shame!\"\n\n\"I hear a voice,\" says Chadband; \"is it a still small voice, my\nfriends? I fear not, though I fain would hope so--\"\n\n\"Ah--h!\" from Mrs. Snagsby.\n\n\"Which says, 'I don't know.' Then I will tell you why. I say this\nbrother present here among us is devoid of parents, devoid of\nrelations, devoid of flocks and herds, devoid of gold, of silver, and\nof precious stones because he is devoid of the light that shines in\nupon some of us. What is that light? What is it? I ask you, what is\nthat light?\"\n\nMr. Chadband draws back his head and pauses, but Mr. Snagsby is not\nto be lured on to his destruction again. Mr. Chadband, leaning\nforward over the table, pierces what he has got to follow directly\ninto Mr. Snagsby with the thumb-nail already mentioned.\n\n\"It is,\" says Chadband, \"the ray of rays, the sun of suns, the moon\nof moons, the star of stars. It is the light of Terewth.\"\n\nMr. Chadband draws himself up again and looks triumphantly at Mr.\nSnagsby as if he would be glad to know how he feels after that.\n\n\"Of Terewth,\" says Mr. Chadband, hitting him again. \"Say not to me\nthat it is NOT the lamp of lamps. I say to you it is. I say to you, a\nmillion of times over, it is. It is! I say to you that I will\nproclaim it to you, whether you like it or not; nay, that the less\nyou like it, the more I will proclaim it to you. With a\nspeaking-trumpet! I say to you that if you rear yourself against it,\nyou shall fall, you shall be bruised, you shall be battered, you\nshall be flawed, you shall be smashed.\"\n\nThe present effect of this flight of oratory--much admired for its\ngeneral power by Mr. Chadband's followers--being not only to make Mr.\nChadband unpleasantly warm, but to represent the innocent Mr. Snagsby\nin the light of a determined enemy to virtue, with a forehead of\nbrass and a heart of adamant, that unfortunate tradesman becomes yet\nmore disconcerted and is in a very advanced state of low spirits and\nfalse position when Mr. Chadband accidentally finishes him.\n\n\"My friends,\" he resumes after dabbing his fat head for some\ntime--and it smokes to such an extent that he seems to light his\npocket-handkerchief at it, which smokes, too, after every dab--\"to\npursue the subject we are endeavouring with our lowly gifts to\nimprove, let us in a spirit of love inquire what is that Terewth to\nwhich I have alluded. For, my young friends,\" suddenly addressing the\n'prentices and Guster, to their consternation, \"if I am told by the\ndoctor that calomel or castor-oil is good for me, I may naturally ask\nwhat is calomel, and what is castor-oil. I may wish to be informed of\nthat before I dose myself with either or with both. Now, my young\nfriends, what is this Terewth then? Firstly (in a spirit of love),\nwhat is the common sort of Terewth--the working clothes--the\nevery-day wear, my young friends? Is it deception?\"\n\n\"Ah--h!\" from Mrs. Snagsby.\n\n\"Is it suppression?\"\n\nA shiver in the negative from Mrs. Snagsby.\n\n\"Is it reservation?\"\n\nA shake of the head from Mrs. Snagsby--very long and very tight.\n\n\"No, my friends, it is neither of these. Neither of these names\nbelongs to it. When this young heathen now among us--who is now, my\nfriends, asleep, the seal of indifference and perdition being set\nupon his eyelids; but do not wake him, for it is right that I should\nhave to wrestle, and to combat and to struggle, and to conquer, for\nhis sake--when this young hardened heathen told us a story of a cock,\nand of a bull, and of a lady, and of a sovereign, was THAT the\nTerewth? No. Or if it was partly, was it wholly and entirely? No, my\nfriends, no!\"\n\nIf Mr. Snagsby could withstand his little woman's look as it enters\nat his eyes, the windows of his soul, and searches the whole\ntenement, he were other than the man he is. He cowers and droops.\n\n\"Or, my juvenile friends,\" says Chadband, descending to the level of\ntheir comprehension with a very obtrusive demonstration in his\ngreasily meek smile of coming a long way downstairs for the purpose,\n\"if the master of this house was to go forth into the city and there\nsee an eel, and was to come back, and was to call unto him the\nmistress of this house, and was to say, 'Sarah, rejoice with me, for\nI have seen an elephant!' would THAT be Terewth?\"\n\nMrs. Snagsby in tears.\n\n\"Or put it, my juvenile friends, that he saw an elephant, and\nreturning said 'Lo, the city is barren, I have seen but an eel,'\nwould THAT be Terewth?\"\n\nMrs. Snagsby sobbing loudly.\n\n\"Or put it, my juvenile friends,\" said Chadband, stimulated by the\nsound, \"that the unnatural parents of this slumbering heathen--for\nparents he had, my juvenile friends, beyond a doubt--after casting\nhim forth to the wolves and the vultures, and the wild dogs and the\nyoung gazelles, and the serpents, went back to their dwellings and\nhad their pipes, and their pots, and their flutings and their\ndancings, and their malt liquors, and their butcher's meat and\npoultry, would THAT be Terewth?\"\n\nMrs. Snagsby replies by delivering herself a prey to spasms, not an\nunresisting prey, but a crying and a tearing one, so that Cook's\nCourt re-echoes with her shrieks. Finally, becoming cataleptic, she\nhas to be carried up the narrow staircase like a grand piano. After\nunspeakable suffering, productive of the utmost consternation, she is\npronounced, by expresses from the bedroom, free from pain, though\nmuch exhausted, in which state of affairs Mr. Snagsby, trampled and\ncrushed in the piano-forte removal, and extremely timid and feeble,\nventures to come out from behind the door in the drawing-room.\n\nAll this time Jo has been standing on the spot where he woke up, ever\npicking his cap and putting bits of fur in his mouth. He spits them\nout with a remorseful air, for he feels that it is in his nature to\nbe an unimprovable reprobate and that it's no good HIS trying to keep\nawake, for HE won't never know nothink. Though it may be, Jo, that\nthere is a history so interesting and affecting even to minds as near\nthe brutes as thine, recording deeds done on this earth for common\nmen, that if the Chadbands, removing their own persons from the\nlight, would but show it thee in simple reverence, would but leave it\nunimproved, would but regard it as being eloquent enough without\ntheir modest aid--it might hold thee awake, and thou might learn from\nit yet!\n\nJo never heard of any such book. Its compilers and the Reverend\nChadband are all one to him, except that he knows the Reverend\nChadband and would rather run away from him for an hour than hear him\ntalk for five minutes. \"It an't no good my waiting here no longer,\"\nthinks Jo. \"Mr. Snagsby an't a-going to say nothink to me to-night.\"\nAnd downstairs he shuffles.\n\nBut downstairs is the charitable Guster, holding by the handrail of\nthe kitchen stairs and warding off a fit, as yet doubtfully, the same\nhaving been induced by Mrs. Snagsby's screaming. She has her own\nsupper of bread and cheese to hand to Jo, with whom she ventures to\ninterchange a word or so for the first time.\n\n\"Here's something to eat, poor boy,\" says Guster.\n\n\"Thank'ee, mum,\" says Jo.\n\n\"Are you hungry?\"\n\n\"Jist!\" says Jo.\n\n\"What's gone of your father and your mother, eh?\"\n\nJo stops in the middle of a bite and looks petrified. For this orphan\ncharge of the Christian saint whose shrine was at Tooting has patted\nhim on the shoulder, and it is the first time in his life that any\ndecent hand has been so laid upon him.\n\n\"I never know'd nothink about 'em,\" says Jo.\n\n\"No more didn't I of mine,\" cries Guster. She is repressing symptoms\nfavourable to the fit when she seems to take alarm at something and\nvanishes down the stairs.\n\n\"Jo,\" whispers the law-stationer softly as the boy lingers on the\nstep.\n\n\"Here I am, Mr. Snagsby!\"\n\n\"I didn't know you were gone--there's another half-crown, Jo. It was\nquite right of you to say nothing about the lady the other night when\nwe were out together. It would breed trouble. You can't be too quiet,\nJo.\"\n\n\"I am fly, master!\"\n\nAnd so, good night.\n\nA ghostly shade, frilled and night-capped, follows the law-stationer\nto the room he came from and glides higher up. And henceforth he\nbegins, go where he will, to be attended by another shadow than his\nown, hardly less constant than his own, hardly less quiet than his\nown. And into whatsoever atmosphere of secrecy his own shadow may\npass, let all concerned in the secrecy beware! For the watchful Mrs.\nSnagsby is there too--bone of his bone, flesh of his flesh, shadow of\nhis shadow.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVI\n\nSharpshooters\n\n\nWintry morning, looking with dull eyes and sallow face upon the\nneighbourhood of Leicester Square, finds its inhabitants unwilling to\nget out of bed. Many of them are not early risers at the brightest of\ntimes, being birds of night who roost when the sun is high and are\nwide awake and keen for prey when the stars shine out. Behind dingy\nblind and curtain, in upper story and garret, skulking more or less\nunder false names, false hair, false titles, false jewellery, and\nfalse histories, a colony of brigands lie in their first sleep.\nGentlemen of the green-baize road who could discourse from personal\nexperience of foreign galleys and home treadmills; spies of strong\ngovernments that eternally quake with weakness and miserable fear,\nbroken traitors, cowards, bullies, gamesters, shufflers, swindlers,\nand false witnesses; some not unmarked by the branding-iron beneath\ntheir dirty braid; all with more cruelty in them than was in Nero,\nand more crime than is in Newgate. For howsoever bad the devil can be\nin fustian or smock-frock (and he can be very bad in both), he is a\nmore designing, callous, and intolerable devil when he sticks a pin\nin his shirt-front, calls himself a gentleman, backs a card or\ncolour, plays a game or so of billiards, and knows a little about\nbills and promissory notes than in any other form he wears. And in\nsuch form Mr. Bucket shall find him, when he will, still pervading\nthe tributary channels of Leicester Square.\n\nBut the wintry morning wants him not and wakes him not. It wakes Mr.\nGeorge of the shooting gallery and his familiar. They arise, roll up\nand stow away their mattresses. Mr. George, having shaved himself\nbefore a looking-glass of minute proportions, then marches out,\nbare-headed and bare-chested, to the pump in the little yard and anon\ncomes back shining with yellow soap, friction, drifting rain, and\nexceedingly cold water. As he rubs himself upon a large jack-towel,\nblowing like a military sort of diver just come up, his hair curling\ntighter and tighter on his sunburnt temples the more he rubs it so\nthat it looks as if it never could be loosened by any less coercive\ninstrument than an iron rake or a curry-comb--as he rubs, and puffs,\nand polishes, and blows, turning his head from side to side the more\nconveniently to excoriate his throat, and standing with his body well\nbent forward to keep the wet from his martial legs, Phil, on his\nknees lighting a fire, looks round as if it were enough washing for\nhim to see all that done, and sufficient renovation for one day to\ntake in the superfluous health his master throws off.\n\nWhen Mr. George is dry, he goes to work to brush his head with two\nhard brushes at once, to that unmerciful degree that Phil,\nshouldering his way round the gallery in the act of sweeping it,\nwinks with sympathy. This chafing over, the ornamental part of Mr.\nGeorge's toilet is soon performed. He fills his pipe, lights it, and\nmarches up and down smoking, as his custom is, while Phil, raising a\npowerful odour of hot rolls and coffee, prepares breakfast. He smokes\ngravely and marches in slow time. Perhaps this morning's pipe is\ndevoted to the memory of Gridley in his grave.\n\n\"And so, Phil,\" says George of the shooting gallery after several\nturns in silence, \"you were dreaming of the country last night?\"\n\nPhil, by the by, said as much in a tone of surprise as he scrambled\nout of bed.\n\n\"Yes, guv'ner.\"\n\n\"What was it like?\"\n\n\"I hardly know what it was like, guv'ner,\" said Phil, considering.\n\n\"How did you know it was the country?\"\n\n\"On account of the grass, I think. And the swans upon it,\" says Phil\nafter further consideration.\n\n\"What were the swans doing on the grass?\"\n\n\"They was a-eating of it, I expect,\" says Phil.\n\nThe master resumes his march, and the man resumes his preparation of\nbreakfast. It is not necessarily a lengthened preparation, being\nlimited to the setting forth of very simple breakfast requisites for\ntwo and the broiling of a rasher of bacon at the fire in the rusty\ngrate; but as Phil has to sidle round a considerable part of the\ngallery for every object he wants, and never brings two objects at\nonce, it takes time under the circumstances. At length the breakfast\nis ready. Phil announcing it, Mr. George knocks the ashes out of his\npipe on the hob, stands his pipe itself in the chimney corner, and\nsits down to the meal. When he has helped himself, Phil follows suit,\nsitting at the extreme end of the little oblong table and taking his\nplate on his knees. Either in humility, or to hide his blackened\nhands, or because it is his natural manner of eating.\n\n\"The country,\" says Mr. George, plying his knife and fork; \"why, I\nsuppose you never clapped your eyes on the country, Phil?\"\n\n\"I see the marshes once,\" says Phil, contentedly eating his\nbreakfast.\n\n\"What marshes?\"\n\n\"THE marshes, commander,\" returns Phil.\n\n\"Where are they?\"\n\n\"I don't know where they are,\" says Phil; \"but I see 'em, guv'ner.\nThey was flat. And miste.\"\n\nGovernor and commander are interchangeable terms with Phil,\nexpressive of the same respect and deference and applicable to nobody\nbut Mr. George.\n\n\"I was born in the country, Phil.\"\n\n\"Was you indeed, commander?\"\n\n\"Yes. And bred there.\"\n\nPhil elevates his one eyebrow, and after respectfully staring at his\nmaster to express interest, swallows a great gulp of coffee, still\nstaring at him.\n\n\"There's not a bird's note that I don't know,\" says Mr. George. \"Not\nmany an English leaf or berry that I couldn't name. Not many a tree\nthat I couldn't climb yet if I was put to it. I was a real country\nboy, once. My good mother lived in the country.\"\n\n\"She must have been a fine old lady, guv'ner,\" Phil observes.\n\n\"Aye! And not so old either, five and thirty years ago,\" says Mr.\nGeorge. \"But I'll wager that at ninety she would be near as upright\nas me, and near as broad across the shoulders.\"\n\n\"Did she die at ninety, guv'ner?\" inquires Phil.\n\n\"No. Bosh! Let her rest in peace, God bless her!\" says the\ntrooper. \"What set me on about country boys, and runaways, and\ngood-for-nothings? You, to be sure! So you never clapped your eyes\nupon the country--marshes and dreams excepted. Eh?\"\n\nPhil shakes his head.\n\n\"Do you want to see it?\"\n\n\"N-no, I don't know as I do, particular,\" says Phil.\n\n\"The town's enough for you, eh?\"\n\n\"Why, you see, commander,\" says Phil, \"I ain't acquainted with\nanythink else, and I doubt if I ain't a-getting too old to take to\nnovelties.\"\n\n\"How old ARE you, Phil?\" asks the trooper, pausing as he conveys his\nsmoking saucer to his lips.\n\n\"I'm something with a eight in it,\" says Phil. \"It can't be eighty.\nNor yet eighteen. It's betwixt 'em, somewheres.\"\n\nMr. George, slowly putting down his saucer without tasting its\ncontents, is laughingly beginning, \"Why, what the deuce, Phil--\" when\nhe stops, seeing that Phil is counting on his dirty fingers.\n\n\"I was just eight,\" says Phil, \"agreeable to the parish calculation,\nwhen I went with the tinker. I was sent on a errand, and I see him\na-sittin under a old buildin with a fire all to himself wery\ncomfortable, and he says, 'Would you like to come along a me, my\nman?' I says 'Yes,' and him and me and the fire goes home to\nClerkenwell together. That was April Fool Day. I was able to count up\nto ten; and when April Fool Day come round again, I says to myself,\n'Now, old chap, you're one and a eight in it.' April Fool Day after\nthat, I says, 'Now, old chap, you're two and a eight in it.' In\ncourse of time, I come to ten and a eight in it; two tens and a eight\nin it. When it got so high, it got the upper hand of me, but this is\nhow I always know there's a eight in it.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" says Mr. George, resuming his breakfast. \"And where's the\ntinker?\"\n\n\"Drink put him in the hospital, guv'ner, and the hospital put him--in\na glass-case, I HAVE heerd,\" Phil replies mysteriously.\n\n\"By that means you got promotion? Took the business, Phil?\"\n\n\"Yes, commander, I took the business. Such as it was. It wasn't much\nof a beat--round Saffron Hill, Hatton Garden, Clerkenwell, Smiffeld,\nand there--poor neighbourhood, where they uses up the kettles till\nthey're past mending. Most of the tramping tinkers used to come and\nlodge at our place; that was the best part of my master's earnings.\nBut they didn't come to me. I warn't like him. He could sing 'em a\ngood song. I couldn't! He could play 'em a tune on any sort of pot\nyou please, so as it was iron or block tin. I never could do nothing\nwith a pot but mend it or bile it--never had a note of music in me.\nBesides, I was too ill-looking, and their wives complained of me.\"\n\n\"They were mighty particular. You would pass muster in a crowd,\nPhil!\" says the trooper with a pleasant smile.\n\n\"No, guv'ner,\" returns Phil, shaking his head. \"No, I shouldn't. I\nwas passable enough when I went with the tinker, though nothing to\nboast of then; but what with blowing the fire with my mouth when I\nwas young, and spileing my complexion, and singeing my hair off, and\nswallering the smoke, and what with being nat'rally unfort'nate in\nthe way of running against hot metal and marking myself by sich\nmeans, and what with having turn-ups with the tinker as I got older,\nalmost whenever he was too far gone in drink--which was almost\nalways--my beauty was queer, wery queer, even at that time. As to\nsince, what with a dozen years in a dark forge where the men was\ngiven to larking, and what with being scorched in a accident at a\ngas-works, and what with being blowed out of winder case-filling at\nthe firework business, I am ugly enough to be made a show on!\"\n\nResigning himself to which condition with a perfectly satisfied\nmanner, Phil begs the favour of another cup of coffee. While drinking\nit, he says, \"It was after the case-filling blow-up when I first see\nyou, commander. You remember?\"\n\n\"I remember, Phil. You were walking along in the sun.\"\n\n\"Crawling, guv'ner, again a wall--\"\n\n\"True, Phil--shouldering your way on--\"\n\n\"In a night-cap!\" exclaims Phil, excited.\n\n\"In a night-cap--\"\n\n\"And hobbling with a couple of sticks!\" cries Phil, still more\nexcited.\n\n\"With a couple of sticks. When--\"\n\n\"When you stops, you know,\" cries Phil, putting down his cup and\nsaucer and hastily removing his plate from his knees, \"and says to\nme, 'What, comrade! You have been in the wars!' I didn't say much to\nyou, commander, then, for I was took by surprise that a person so\nstrong and healthy and bold as you was should stop to speak to such a\nlimping bag of bones as I was. But you says to me, says you,\ndelivering it out of your chest as hearty as possible, so that it was\nlike a glass of something hot, 'What accident have you met with? You\nhave been badly hurt. What's amiss, old boy? Cheer up, and tell us\nabout it!' Cheer up! I was cheered already! I says as much to you,\nyou says more to me, I says more to you, you says more to me, and\nhere I am, commander! Here I am, commander!\" cries Phil, who has\nstarted from his chair and unaccountably begun to sidle away. \"If a\nmark's wanted, or if it will improve the business, let the customers\ntake aim at me. They can't spoil MY beauty. I'M all right. Come on!\nIf they want a man to box at, let 'em box at me. Let 'em knock me\nwell about the head. I don't mind. If they want a light-weight to be\nthrowed for practice, Cornwall, Devonshire, or Lancashire, let 'em\nthrow me. They won't hurt ME. I have been throwed, all sorts of\nstyles, all my life!\"\n\nWith this unexpected speech, energetically delivered and accompanied\nby action illustrative of the various exercises referred to, Phil\nSquod shoulders his way round three sides of the gallery, and\nabruptly tacking off at his commander, makes a butt at him with his\nhead, intended to express devotion to his service. He then begins to\nclear away the breakfast.\n\nMr. George, after laughing cheerfully and clapping him on the\nshoulder, assists in these arrangements and helps to get the gallery\ninto business order. That done, he takes a turn at the dumb-bells,\nand afterwards weighing himself and opining that he is getting \"too\nfleshy,\" engages with great gravity in solitary broadsword practice.\nMeanwhile Phil has fallen to work at his usual table, where he screws\nand unscrews, and cleans, and files, and whistles into small\napertures, and blackens himself more and more, and seems to do and\nundo everything that can be done and undone about a gun.\n\nMaster and man are at length disturbed by footsteps in the passage,\nwhere they make an unusual sound, denoting the arrival of unusual\ncompany. These steps, advancing nearer and nearer to the gallery,\nbring into it a group at first sight scarcely reconcilable with any\nday in the year but the fifth of November.\n\nIt consists of a limp and ugly figure carried in a chair by two\nbearers and attended by a lean female with a face like a pinched\nmask, who might be expected immediately to recite the popular verses\ncommemorative of the time when they did contrive to blow Old England\nup alive but for her keeping her lips tightly and defiantly closed as\nthe chair is put down. At which point the figure in it gasping, \"O\nLord! Oh, dear me! I am shaken!\" adds, \"How de do, my dear friend,\nhow de do?\" Mr. George then descries, in the procession, the\nvenerable Mr. Smallweed out for an airing, attended by his\ngranddaughter Judy as body-guard.\n\n\"Mr. George, my dear friend,\" says Grandfather Smallweed, removing\nhis right arm from the neck of one of his bearers, whom he has nearly\nthrottled coming along, \"how de do? You're surprised to see me, my\ndear friend.\"\n\n\"I should hardly have been more surprised to have seen your friend in\nthe city,\" returns Mr. George.\n\n\"I am very seldom out,\" pants Mr. Smallweed. \"I haven't been out for\nmany months. It's inconvenient--and it comes expensive. But I longed\nso much to see you, my dear Mr. George. How de do, sir?\"\n\n\"I am well enough,\" says Mr. George. \"I hope you are the same.\"\n\n\"You can't be too well, my dear friend.\" Mr. Smallweed takes him by\nboth hands. \"I have brought my granddaughter Judy. I couldn't keep\nher away. She longed so much to see you.\"\n\n\"Hum! She bears it calmly!\" mutters Mr. George.\n\n\"So we got a hackney-cab, and put a chair in it, and just round the\ncorner they lifted me out of the cab and into the chair, and carried\nme here that I might see my dear friend in his own establishment!\nThis,\" says Grandfather Smallweed, alluding to the bearer, who has\nbeen in danger of strangulation and who withdraws adjusting his\nwindpipe, \"is the driver of the cab. He has nothing extra. It is by\nagreement included in his fare. This person,\" the other bearer, \"we\nengaged in the street outside for a pint of beer. Which is twopence.\nJudy, give the person twopence. I was not sure you had a workman of\nyour own here, my dear friend, or we needn't have employed this\nperson.\"\n\nGrandfather Smallweed refers to Phil with a glance of considerable\nterror and a half-subdued \"O Lord! Oh, dear me!\" Nor in his\napprehension, on the surface of things, without some reason, for\nPhil, who has never beheld the apparition in the black-velvet cap\nbefore, has stopped short with a gun in his hand with much of the air\nof a dead shot intent on picking Mr. Smallweed off as an ugly old\nbird of the crow species.\n\n\"Judy, my child,\" says Grandfather Smallweed, \"give the person his\ntwopence. It's a great deal for what he has done.\"\n\nThe person, who is one of those extraordinary specimens of human\nfungus that spring up spontaneously in the western streets of London,\nready dressed in an old red jacket, with a \"mission\" for holding\nhorses and calling coaches, received his twopence with anything but\ntransport, tosses the money into the air, catches it over-handed, and\nretires.\n\n\"My dear Mr. George,\" says Grandfather Smallweed, \"would you be so\nkind as help to carry me to the fire? I am accustomed to a fire, and\nI am an old man, and I soon chill. Oh, dear me!\"\n\nHis closing exclamation is jerked out of the venerable gentleman by\nthe suddenness with which Mr. Squod, like a genie, catches him up,\nchair and all, and deposits him on the hearth-stone.\n\n\"O Lord!\" says Mr. Smallweed, panting. \"Oh, dear me! Oh, my stars! My\ndear friend, your workman is very strong--and very prompt. O Lord, he\nis very prompt! Judy, draw me back a little. I'm being scorched in\nthe legs,\" which indeed is testified to the noses of all present by\nthe smell of his worsted stockings.\n\nThe gentle Judy, having backed her grandfather a little way from the\nfire, and having shaken him up as usual, and having released his\novershadowed eye from its black-velvet extinguisher, Mr. Smallweed\nagain says, \"Oh, dear me! O Lord!\" and looking about and meeting Mr.\nGeorge's glance, again stretches out both hands.\n\n\"My dear friend! So happy in this meeting! And this is your\nestablishment? It's a delightful place. It's a picture! You never\nfind that anything goes off here accidentally, do you, my dear\nfriend?\" adds Grandfather Smallweed, very ill at ease.\n\n\"No, no. No fear of that.\"\n\n\"And your workman. He--Oh, dear me!--he never lets anything off\nwithout meaning it, does he, my dear friend?\"\n\n\"He has never hurt anybody but himself,\" says Mr. George, smiling.\n\n\"But he might, you know. He seems to have hurt himself a good deal,\nand he might hurt somebody else,\" the old gentleman returns. \"He\nmightn't mean it--or he even might. Mr. George, will you order him to\nleave his infernal fire-arms alone and go away?\"\n\nObedient to a nod from the trooper, Phil retires, empty-handed, to\nthe other end of the gallery. Mr. Smallweed, reassured, falls to\nrubbing his legs.\n\n\"And you're doing well, Mr. George?\" he says to the trooper, squarely\nstanding faced about towards him with his broadsword in his hand.\n\"You are prospering, please the Powers?\"\n\nMr. George answers with a cool nod, adding, \"Go on. You have not come\nto say that, I know.\"\n\n\"You are so sprightly, Mr. George,\" returns the venerable\ngrandfather. \"You are such good company.\"\n\n\"Ha ha! Go on!\" says Mr. George.\n\n\"My dear friend! But that sword looks awful gleaming and sharp. It\nmight cut somebody, by accident. It makes me shiver, Mr. George.\nCurse him!\" says the excellent old gentleman apart to Judy as the\ntrooper takes a step or two away to lay it aside. \"He owes me money,\nand might think of paying off old scores in this murdering place. I\nwish your brimstone grandmother was here, and he'd shave her head\noff.\"\n\nMr. George, returning, folds his arms, and looking down at the old\nman, sliding every moment lower and lower in his chair, says quietly,\n\"Now for it!\"\n\n\"Ho!\" cries Mr. Smallweed, rubbing his hands with an artful chuckle.\n\"Yes. Now for it. Now for what, my dear friend?\"\n\n\"For a pipe,\" says Mr. George, who with great composure sets his\nchair in the chimney-corner, takes his pipe from the grate, fills it\nand lights it, and falls to smoking peacefully.\n\nThis tends to the discomfiture of Mr. Smallweed, who finds it so\ndifficult to resume his object, whatever it may be, that he becomes\nexasperated and secretly claws the air with an impotent\nvindictiveness expressive of an intense desire to tear and rend the\nvisage of Mr. George. As the excellent old gentleman's nails are long\nand leaden, and his hands lean and veinous, and his eyes green and\nwatery; and, over and above this, as he continues, while he claws, to\nslide down in his chair and to collapse into a shapeless bundle, he\nbecomes such a ghastly spectacle, even in the accustomed eyes of\nJudy, that that young virgin pounces at him with something more than\nthe ardour of affection and so shakes him up and pats and pokes him\nin divers parts of his body, but particularly in that part which the\nscience of self-defence would call his wind, that in his grievous\ndistress he utters enforced sounds like a paviour's rammer.\n\nWhen Judy has by these means set him up again in his chair, with a\nwhite face and a frosty nose (but still clawing), she stretches out\nher weazen forefinger and gives Mr. George one poke in the back. The\ntrooper raising his head, she makes another poke at her esteemed\ngrandfather, and having thus brought them together, stares rigidly at\nthe fire.\n\n\"Aye, aye! Ho, ho! U--u--u--ugh!\" chatters Grandfather Smallweed,\nswallowing his rage. \"My dear friend!\" (still clawing).\n\n\"I tell you what,\" says Mr. George. \"If you want to converse with me,\nyou must speak out. I am one of the roughs, and I can't go about and\nabout. I haven't the art to do it. I am not clever enough. It don't\nsuit me. When you go winding round and round me,\" says the trooper,\nputting his pipe between his lips again, \"damme, if I don't feel as\nif I was being smothered!\"\n\nAnd he inflates his broad chest to its utmost extent as if to assure\nhimself that he is not smothered yet.\n\n\"If you have come to give me a friendly call,\" continues Mr. George,\n\"I am obliged to you; how are you? If you have come to see whether\nthere's any property on the premises, look about you; you are\nwelcome. If you want to out with something, out with it!\"\n\nThe blooming Judy, without removing her gaze from the fire, gives her\ngrandfather one ghostly poke.\n\n\"You see! It's her opinion too. And why the devil that young woman\nwon't sit down like a Christian,\" says Mr. George with his eyes\nmusingly fixed on Judy, \"I can't comprehend.\"\n\n\"She keeps at my side to attend to me, sir,\" says Grandfather\nSmallweed. \"I am an old man, my dear Mr. George, and I need some\nattention. I can carry my years; I am not a brimstone poll-parrot\"\n(snarling and looking unconsciously for the cushion), \"but I need\nattention, my dear friend.\"\n\n\"Well!\" returns the trooper, wheeling his chair to face the old man.\n\"Now then?\"\n\n\"My friend in the city, Mr. George, has done a little business with a\npupil of yours.\"\n\n\"Has he?\" says Mr. George. \"I am sorry to hear it.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\" Grandfather Smallweed rubs his legs. \"He is a fine young\nsoldier now, Mr. George, by the name of Carstone. Friends came\nforward and paid it all up, honourable.\"\n\n\"Did they?\" returns Mr. George. \"Do you think your friend in the city\nwould like a piece of advice?\"\n\n\"I think he would, my dear friend. From you.\"\n\n\"I advise him, then, to do no more business in that quarter. There's\nno more to be got by it. The young gentleman, to my knowledge, is\nbrought to a dead halt.\"\n\n\"No, no, my dear friend. No, no, Mr. George. No, no, no, sir,\"\nremonstrates Grandfather Smallweed, cunningly rubbing his spare legs.\n\"Not quite a dead halt, I think. He has good friends, and he is good\nfor his pay, and he is good for the selling price of his commission,\nand he is good for his chance in a lawsuit, and he is good for his\nchance in a wife, and--oh, do you know, Mr. George, I think my friend\nwould consider the young gentleman good for something yet?\" says\nGrandfather Smallweed, turning up his velvet cap and scratching his\near like a monkey.\n\nMr. George, who has put aside his pipe and sits with an arm on his\nchair-back, beats a tattoo on the ground with his right foot as if he\nwere not particularly pleased with the turn the conversation has\ntaken.\n\n\"But to pass from one subject to another,\" resumes Mr. Smallweed.\n\"'To promote the conversation,' as a joker might say. To pass, Mr.\nGeorge, from the ensign to the captain.\"\n\n\"What are you up to, now?\" asks Mr. George, pausing with a frown in\nstroking the recollection of his moustache. \"What captain?\"\n\n\"Our captain. The captain we know of. Captain Hawdon.\"\n\n\"Oh! That's it, is it?\" says Mr. George with a low whistle as he sees\nboth grandfather and granddaughter looking hard at him. \"You are\nthere! Well? What about it? Come, I won't be smothered any more.\nSpeak!\"\n\n\"My dear friend,\" returns the old man, \"I was applied--Judy, shake me\nup a little!--I was applied to yesterday about the captain, and my\nopinion still is that the captain is not dead.\"\n\n\"Bosh!\" observes Mr. George.\n\n\"What was your remark, my dear friend?\" inquires the old man with his\nhand to his ear.\n\n\"Bosh!\"\n\n\"Ho!\" says Grandfather Smallweed. \"Mr. George, of my opinion you can\njudge for yourself according to the questions asked of me and the\nreasons given for asking 'em. Now, what do you think the lawyer\nmaking the inquiries wants?\"\n\n\"A job,\" says Mr. George.\n\n\"Nothing of the kind!\"\n\n\"Can't be a lawyer, then,\" says Mr. George, folding his arms with an\nair of confirmed resolution.\n\n\"My dear friend, he is a lawyer, and a famous one. He wants to see\nsome fragment in Captain Hawdon's writing. He don't want to keep it.\nHe only wants to see it and compare it with a writing in his\npossession.\"\n\n\"Well?\"\n\n\"Well, Mr. George. Happening to remember the advertisement concerning\nCaptain Hawdon and any information that could be given respecting\nhim, he looked it up and came to me--just as you did, my dear friend.\nWILL you shake hands? So glad you came that day! I should have missed\nforming such a friendship if you hadn't come!\"\n\n\"Well, Mr. Smallweed?\" says Mr. George again after going through the\nceremony with some stiffness.\n\n\"I had no such thing. I have nothing but his signature. Plague\npestilence and famine, battle murder and sudden death upon him,\" says\nthe old man, making a curse out of one of his few remembrances of a\nprayer and squeezing up his velvet cap between his angry hands, \"I\nhave half a million of his signatures, I think! But you,\"\nbreathlessly recovering his mildness of speech as Judy re-adjusts the\ncap on his skittle-ball of a head, \"you, my dear Mr. George, are\nlikely to have some letter or paper that would suit the purpose.\nAnything would suit the purpose, written in the hand.\"\n\n\"Some writing in that hand,\" says the trooper, pondering; \"may be, I\nhave.\"\n\n\"My dearest friend!\"\n\n\"May be, I have not.\"\n\n\"Ho!\" says Grandfather Smallweed, crest-fallen.\n\n\"But if I had bushels of it, I would not show as much as would make a\ncartridge without knowing why.\"\n\n\"Sir, I have told you why. My dear Mr. George, I have told you why.\"\n\n\"Not enough,\" says the trooper, shaking his head. \"I must know more,\nand approve it.\"\n\n\"Then, will you come to the lawyer? My dear friend, will you come and\nsee the gentleman?\" urges Grandfather Smallweed, pulling out a lean\nold silver watch with hands like the leg of a skeleton. \"I told him\nit was probable I might call upon him between ten and eleven this\nforenoon, and it's now half after ten. Will you come and see the\ngentleman, Mr. George?\"\n\n\"Hum!\" says he gravely. \"I don't mind that. Though why this should\nconcern you so much, I don't know.\"\n\n\"Everything concerns me that has a chance in it of bringing anything\nto light about him. Didn't he take us all in? Didn't he owe us\nimmense sums, all round? Concern me? Who can anything about him\nconcern more than me? Not, my dear friend,\" says Grandfather\nSmallweed, lowering his tone, \"that I want YOU to betray anything.\nFar from it. Are you ready to come, my dear friend?\"\n\n\"Aye! I'll come in a moment. I promise nothing, you know.\"\n\n\"No, my dear Mr. George; no.\"\n\n\"And you mean to say you're going to give me a lift to this place,\nwherever it is, without charging for it?\" Mr. George inquires,\ngetting his hat and thick wash-leather gloves.\n\nThis pleasantry so tickles Mr. Smallweed that he laughs, long and\nlow, before the fire. But ever while he laughs, he glances over his\nparalytic shoulder at Mr. George and eagerly watches him as he\nunlocks the padlock of a homely cupboard at the distant end of the\ngallery, looks here and there upon the higher shelves, and ultimately\ntakes something out with a rustling of paper, folds it, and puts it\nin his breast. Then Judy pokes Mr. Smallweed once, and Mr. Smallweed\npokes Judy once.\n\n\"I am ready,\" says the trooper, coming back. \"Phil, you can carry\nthis old gentleman to his coach, and make nothing of him.\"\n\n\"Oh, dear me! O Lord! Stop a moment!\" says Mr. Smallweed. \"He's so\nvery prompt! Are you sure you can do it carefully, my worthy man?\"\n\nPhil makes no reply, but seizing the chair and its load, sidles away,\ntightly hugged by the now speechless Mr. Smallweed, and bolts along\nthe passage as if he had an acceptable commission to carry the old\ngentleman to the nearest volcano. His shorter trust, however,\nterminating at the cab, he deposits him there; and the fair Judy\ntakes her place beside him, and the chair embellishes the roof, and\nMr. George takes the vacant place upon the box.\n\nMr. George is quite confounded by the spectacle he beholds from time\nto time as he peeps into the cab through the window behind him, where\nthe grim Judy is always motionless, and the old gentleman with his\ncap over one eye is always sliding off the seat into the straw and\nlooking upward at him out of his other eye with a helpless expression\nof being jolted in the back.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVII\n\nMore Old Soldiers Than One\n\n\nMr. George has not far to ride with folded arms upon the box, for\ntheir destination is Lincoln's Inn Fields. When the driver stops his\nhorses, Mr. George alights, and looking in at the window, says,\n\"What, Mr. Tulkinghorn's your man, is he?\"\n\n\"Yes, my dear friend. Do you know him, Mr. George?\"\n\n\"Why, I have heard of him--seen him too, I think. But I don't know\nhim, and he don't know me.\"\n\nThere ensues the carrying of Mr. Smallweed upstairs, which is done to\nperfection with the trooper's help. He is borne into Mr.\nTulkinghorn's great room and deposited on the Turkey rug before the\nfire. Mr. Tulkinghorn is not within at the present moment but will be\nback directly. The occupant of the pew in the hall, having said thus\nmuch, stirs the fire and leaves the triumvirate to warm themselves.\n\nMr. George is mightily curious in respect of the room. He looks up at\nthe painted ceiling, looks round at the old law-books, contemplates\nthe portraits of the great clients, reads aloud the names on the\nboxes.\n\n\"'Sir Leicester Dedlock, Baronet,'\" Mr. George reads thoughtfully.\n\"Ha! 'Manor of Chesney Wold.' Humph!\" Mr. George stands looking at\nthese boxes a long while--as if they were pictures--and comes back to\nthe fire repeating, \"Sir Leicester Dedlock, Baronet, and Manor of\nChesney Wold, hey?\"\n\n\"Worth a mint of money, Mr. George!\" whispers Grandfather Smallweed,\nrubbing his legs. \"Powerfully rich!\"\n\n\"Who do you mean? This old gentleman, or the Baronet?\"\n\n\"This gentleman, this gentleman.\"\n\n\"So I have heard; and knows a thing or two, I'll hold a wager. Not\nbad quarters, either,\" says Mr. George, looking round again. \"See the\nstrong-box yonder!\"\n\nThis reply is cut short by Mr. Tulkinghorn's arrival. There is no\nchange in him, of course. Rustily drest, with his spectacles in his\nhand, and their very case worn threadbare. In manner, close and dry.\nIn voice, husky and low. In face, watchful behind a blind; habitually\nnot uncensorious and contemptuous perhaps. The peerage may have\nwarmer worshippers and faithfuller believers than Mr. Tulkinghorn,\nafter all, if everything were known.\n\n\"Good morning, Mr. Smallweed, good morning!\" he says as he comes in.\n\"You have brought the sergeant, I see. Sit down, sergeant.\"\n\nAs Mr. Tulkinghorn takes off his gloves and puts them in his hat, he\nlooks with half-closed eyes across the room to where the trooper\nstands and says within himself perchance, \"You'll do, my friend!\"\n\n\"Sit down, sergeant,\" he repeats as he comes to his table, which is\nset on one side of the fire, and takes his easy-chair. \"Cold and raw\nthis morning, cold and raw!\" Mr. Tulkinghorn warms before the bars,\nalternately, the palms and knuckles of his hands and looks (from\nbehind that blind which is always down) at the trio sitting in a\nlittle semicircle before him.\n\n\"Now, I can feel what I am about\" (as perhaps he can in two senses),\n\"Mr. Smallweed.\" The old gentleman is newly shaken up by Judy to bear\nhis part in the conversation. \"You have brought our good friend the\nsergeant, I see.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" returns Mr. Smallweed, very servile to the lawyer's\nwealth and influence.\n\n\"And what does the sergeant say about this business?\"\n\n\"Mr. George,\" says Grandfather Smallweed with a tremulous wave of his\nshrivelled hand, \"this is the gentleman, sir.\"\n\nMr. George salutes the gentleman but otherwise sits bolt upright and\nprofoundly silent--very forward in his chair, as if the full\ncomplement of regulation appendages for a field-day hung about him.\n\nMr. Tulkinghorn proceeds, \"Well, George--I believe your name is\nGeorge?\"\n\n\"It is so, Sir.\"\n\n\"What do you say, George?\"\n\n\"I ask your pardon, sir,\" returns the trooper, \"but I should wish to\nknow what YOU say?\"\n\n\"Do you mean in point of reward?\"\n\n\"I mean in point of everything, sir.\"\n\nThis is so very trying to Mr. Smallweed's temper that he suddenly\nbreaks out with \"You're a brimstone beast!\" and as suddenly asks\npardon of Mr. Tulkinghorn, excusing himself for this slip of the\ntongue by saying to Judy, \"I was thinking of your grandmother, my\ndear.\"\n\n\"I supposed, sergeant,\" Mr. Tulkinghorn resumes as he leans on one\nside of his chair and crosses his legs, \"that Mr. Smallweed might\nhave sufficiently explained the matter. It lies in the smallest\ncompass, however. You served under Captain Hawdon at one time, and\nwere his attendant in illness, and rendered him many little services,\nand were rather in his confidence, I am told. That is so, is it not?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir, that is so,\" says Mr. George with military brevity.\n\n\"Therefore you may happen to have in your possession\nsomething--anything, no matter what; accounts, instructions, orders,\na letter, anything--in Captain Hawdon's writing. I wish to compare\nhis writing with some that I have. If you can give me the\nopportunity, you shall be rewarded for your trouble. Three, four,\nfive, guineas, you would consider handsome, I dare say.\"\n\n\"Noble, my dear friend!\" cries Grandfather Smallweed, screwing up his\neyes.\n\n\"If not, say how much more, in your conscience as a soldier, you can\ndemand. There is no need for you to part with the writing, against\nyour inclination--though I should prefer to have it.\"\n\nMr. George sits squared in exactly the same attitude, looks at the\npainted ceiling, and says never a word. The irascible Mr. Smallweed\nscratches the air.\n\n\"The question is,\" says Mr. Tulkinghorn in his methodical, subdued,\nuninterested way, \"first, whether you have any of Captain Hawdon's\nwriting?\"\n\n\"First, whether I have any of Captain Hawdon's writing, sir,\" repeats\nMr. George.\n\n\"Secondly, what will satisfy you for the trouble of producing it?\"\n\n\"Secondly, what will satisfy me for the trouble of producing it,\nsir,\" repeats Mr. George.\n\n\"Thirdly, you can judge for yourself whether it is at all like that,\"\nsays Mr. Tulkinghorn, suddenly handing him some sheets of written\npaper tied together.\n\n\"Whether it is at all like that, sir. Just so,\" repeats Mr. George.\n\nAll three repetitions Mr. George pronounces in a mechanical manner,\nlooking straight at Mr. Tulkinghorn; nor does he so much as glance at\nthe affidavit in Jarndyce and Jarndyce, that has been given to him\nfor his inspection (though he still holds it in his hand), but\ncontinues to look at the lawyer with an air of troubled meditation.\n\n\"Well?\" says Mr. Tulkinghorn. \"What do you say?\"\n\n\"Well, sir,\" replies Mr. George, rising erect and looking immense, \"I\nwould rather, if you'll excuse me, have nothing to do with this.\"\n\nMr. Tulkinghorn, outwardly quite undisturbed, demands, \"Why not?\"\n\n\"Why, sir,\" returns the trooper. \"Except on military compulsion, I am\nnot a man of business. Among civilians I am what they call in\nScotland a ne'er-do-weel. I have no head for papers, sir. I can stand\nany fire better than a fire of cross questions. I mentioned to Mr.\nSmallweed, only an hour or so ago, that when I come into things of\nthis kind I feel as if I was being smothered. And that is my\nsensation,\" says Mr. George, looking round upon the company, \"at the\npresent moment.\"\n\nWith that, he takes three strides forward to replace the papers on\nthe lawyer's table and three strides backward to resume his former\nstation, where he stands perfectly upright, now looking at the ground\nand now at the painted ceiling, with his hands behind him as if to\nprevent himself from accepting any other document whatever.\n\nUnder this provocation, Mr. Smallweed's favourite adjective of\ndisparagement is so close to his tongue that he begins the words \"my\ndear friend\" with the monosyllable \"brim,\" thus converting the\npossessive pronoun into brimmy and appearing to have an impediment in\nhis speech. Once past this difficulty, however, he exhorts his dear\nfriend in the tenderest manner not to be rash, but to do what so\neminent a gentleman requires, and to do it with a good grace,\nconfident that it must be unobjectionable as well as profitable. Mr.\nTulkinghorn merely utters an occasional sentence, as, \"You are the\nbest judge of your own interest, sergeant.\" \"Take care you do no harm\nby this.\" \"Please yourself, please yourself.\" \"If you know what you\nmean, that's quite enough.\" These he utters with an appearance of\nperfect indifference as he looks over the papers on his table and\nprepares to write a letter.\n\nMr. George looks distrustfully from the painted ceiling to the\nground, from the ground to Mr. Smallweed, from Mr. Smallweed to Mr.\nTulkinghorn, and from Mr. Tulkinghorn to the painted ceiling again,\noften in his perplexity changing the leg on which he rests.\n\n\"I do assure you, sir,\" says Mr. George, \"not to say it offensively,\nthat between you and Mr. Smallweed here, I really am being smothered\nfifty times over. I really am, sir. I am not a match for you\ngentlemen. Will you allow me to ask why you want to see the captain's\nhand, in the case that I could find any specimen of it?\"\n\nMr. Tulkinghorn quietly shakes his head. \"No. If you were a man of\nbusiness, sergeant, you would not need to be informed that there are\nconfidential reasons, very harmless in themselves, for many such\nwants in the profession to which I belong. But if you are afraid of\ndoing any injury to Captain Hawdon, you may set your mind at rest\nabout that.\"\n\n\"Aye! He is dead, sir.\"\n\n\"IS he?\" Mr. Tulkinghorn quietly sits down to write.\n\n\"Well, sir,\" says the trooper, looking into his hat after another\ndisconcerted pause, \"I am sorry not to have given you more\nsatisfaction. If it would be any satisfaction to any one that I\nshould be confirmed in my judgment that I would rather have nothing\nto do with this by a friend of mine who has a better head for\nbusiness than I have, and who is an old soldier, I am willing to\nconsult with him. I--I really am so completely smothered myself at\npresent,\" says Mr. George, passing his hand hopelessly across his\nbrow, \"that I don't know but what it might be a satisfaction to me.\"\n\nMr. Smallweed, hearing that this authority is an old soldier, so\nstrongly inculcates the expediency of the trooper's taking counsel\nwith him, and particularly informing him of its being a question of\nfive guineas or more, that Mr. George engages to go and see him. Mr.\nTulkinghorn says nothing either way.\n\n\"I'll consult my friend, then, by your leave, sir,\" says the trooper,\n\"and I'll take the liberty of looking in again with the final answer\nin the course of the day. Mr. Smallweed, if you wish to be carried\ndownstairs--\"\n\n\"In a moment, my dear friend, in a moment. Will you first let me\nspeak half a word with this gentleman in private?\"\n\n\"Certainly, sir. Don't hurry yourself on my account.\" The trooper\nretires to a distant part of the room and resumes his curious\ninspection of the boxes, strong and otherwise.\n\n\"If I wasn't as weak as a brimstone baby, sir,\" whispers Grandfather\nSmallweed, drawing the lawyer down to his level by the lapel of his\ncoat and flashing some half-quenched green fire out of his angry\neyes, \"I'd tear the writing away from him. He's got it buttoned in\nhis breast. I saw him put it there. Judy saw him put it there. Speak\nup, you crabbed image for the sign of a walking-stick shop, and say\nyou saw him put it there!\"\n\nThis vehement conjuration the old gentleman accompanies with such a\nthrust at his granddaughter that it is too much for his strength, and\nhe slips away out of his chair, drawing Mr. Tulkinghorn with him,\nuntil he is arrested by Judy, and well shaken.\n\n\"Violence will not do for me, my friend,\" Mr. Tulkinghorn then\nremarks coolly.\n\n\"No, no, I know, I know, sir. But it's chafing and\ngalling--it's--it's worse than your smattering chattering magpie of a\ngrandmother,\" to the imperturbable Judy, who only looks at the fire,\n\"to know he has got what's wanted and won't give it up. He, not to\ngive it up! HE! A vagabond! But never mind, sir, never mind. At the\nmost, he has only his own way for a little while. I have him\nperiodically in a vice. I'll twist him, sir. I'll screw him, sir. If\nhe won't do it with a good grace, I'll make him do it with a bad one,\nsir! Now, my dear Mr. George,\" says Grandfather Smallweed, winking at\nthe lawyer hideously as he releases him, \"I am ready for your kind\nassistance, my excellent friend!\"\n\nMr. Tulkinghorn, with some shadowy sign of amusement manifesting\nitself through his self-possession, stands on the hearth-rug with his\nback to the fire, watching the disappearance of Mr. Smallweed and\nacknowledging the trooper's parting salute with one slight nod.\n\nIt is more difficult to get rid of the old gentleman, Mr. George\nfinds, than to bear a hand in carrying him downstairs, for when he is\nreplaced in his conveyance, he is so loquacious on the subject of the\nguineas and retains such an affectionate hold of his button--having,\nin truth, a secret longing to rip his coat open and rob him--that\nsome degree of force is necessary on the trooper's part to effect a\nseparation. It is accomplished at last, and he proceeds alone in\nquest of his adviser.\n\nBy the cloisterly Temple, and by Whitefriars (there, not without a\nglance at Hanging-Sword Alley, which would seem to be something in\nhis way), and by Blackfriars Bridge, and Blackfriars Road, Mr. George\nsedately marches to a street of little shops lying somewhere in that\nganglion of roads from Kent and Surrey, and of streets from the\nbridges of London, centring in the far-famed elephant who has lost\nhis castle formed of a thousand four-horse coaches to a stronger iron\nmonster than he, ready to chop him into mince-meat any day he dares.\nTo one of the little shops in this street, which is a musician's\nshop, having a few fiddles in the window, and some Pan's pipes and a\ntambourine, and a triangle, and certain elongated scraps of music,\nMr. George directs his massive tread. And halting at a few paces from\nit, as he sees a soldierly looking woman, with her outer skirts\ntucked up, come forth with a small wooden tub, and in that tub\ncommence a-whisking and a-splashing on the margin of the pavement,\nMr. George says to himself, \"She's as usual, washing greens. I never\nsaw her, except upon a baggage-waggon, when she wasn't washing\ngreens!\"\n\nThe subject of this reflection is at all events so occupied in\nwashing greens at present that she remains unsuspicious of Mr.\nGeorge's approach until, lifting up herself and her tub together when\nshe has poured the water off into the gutter, she finds him standing\nnear her. Her reception of him is not flattering.\n\n\"George, I never see you but I wish you was a hundred mile away!\"\n\nThe trooper, without remarking on this welcome, follows into the\nmusical-instrument shop, where the lady places her tub of greens upon\nthe counter, and having shaken hands with him, rests her arms upon\nit.\n\n\"I never,\" she says, \"George, consider Matthew Bagnet safe a minute\nwhen you're near him. You are that restless and that roving--\"\n\n\"Yes! I know I am, Mrs. Bagnet. I know I am.\"\n\n\"You know you are!\" says Mrs. Bagnet. \"What's the use of that? WHY\nare you?\"\n\n\"The nature of the animal, I suppose,\" returns the trooper\ngood-humouredly.\n\n\"Ah!\" cries Mrs. Bagnet, something shrilly. \"But what satisfaction\nwill the nature of the animal be to me when the animal shall have\ntempted my Mat away from the musical business to New Zealand or\nAustraley?\"\n\nMrs. Bagnet is not at all an ill-looking woman. Rather large-boned, a\nlittle coarse in the grain, and freckled by the sun and wind which\nhave tanned her hair upon the forehead, but healthy, wholesome, and\nbright-eyed. A strong, busy, active, honest-faced woman of from\nforty-five to fifty. Clean, hardy, and so economically dressed\n(though substantially) that the only article of ornament of which she\nstands possessed appear's to be her wedding-ring, around which her\nfinger has grown to be so large since it was put on that it will\nnever come off again until it shall mingle with Mrs. Bagnet's dust.\n\n\"Mrs. Bagnet,\" says the trooper, \"I am on my parole with you. Mat\nwill get no harm from me. You may trust me so far.\"\n\n\"Well, I think I may. But the very looks of you are unsettling,\" Mrs.\nBagnet rejoins. \"Ah, George, George! If you had only settled down and\nmarried Joe Pouch's widow when he died in North America, SHE'D have\ncombed your hair for you.\"\n\n\"It was a chance for me, certainly,\" returns the trooper half\nlaughingly, half seriously, \"but I shall never settle down into a\nrespectable man now. Joe Pouch's widow might have done me good--there\nwas something in her, and something of her--but I couldn't make up my\nmind to it. If I had had the luck to meet with such a wife as Mat\nfound!\"\n\nMrs. Bagnet, who seems in a virtuous way to be under little reserve\nwith a good sort of fellow, but to be another good sort of fellow\nherself for that matter, receives this compliment by flicking Mr.\nGeorge in the face with a head of greens and taking her tub into the\nlittle room behind the shop.\n\n\"Why, Quebec, my poppet,\" says George, following, on invitation, into\nthat department. \"And little Malta, too! Come and kiss your Bluffy!\"\n\nThese young ladies--not supposed to have been actually christened by\nthe names applied to them, though always so called in the family from\nthe places of their birth in barracks--are respectively employed on\nthree-legged stools, the younger (some five or six years old) in\nlearning her letters out of a penny primer, the elder (eight or nine\nperhaps) in teaching her and sewing with great assiduity. Both hail\nMr. George with acclamations as an old friend and after some kissing\nand romping plant their stools beside him.\n\n\"And how's young Woolwich?\" says Mr. George.\n\n\"Ah! There now!\" cries Mrs. Bagnet, turning about from her saucepans\n(for she is cooking dinner) with a bright flush on her face. \"Would\nyou believe it? Got an engagement at the theayter, with his father,\nto play the fife in a military piece.\"\n\n\"Well done, my godson!\" cries Mr. George, slapping his thigh.\n\n\"I believe you!\" says Mrs. Bagnet. \"He's a Briton. That's what\nWoolwich is. A Briton!\"\n\n\"And Mat blows away at his bassoon, and you're respectable civilians\none and all,\" says Mr. George. \"Family people. Children growing up.\nMat's old mother in Scotland, and your old father somewhere else,\ncorresponded with, and helped a little, and--well, well! To be sure,\nI don't know why I shouldn't be wished a hundred mile away, for I\nhave not much to do with all this!\"\n\nMr. George is becoming thoughtful, sitting before the fire in the\nwhitewashed room, which has a sanded floor and a barrack smell and\ncontains nothing superfluous and has not a visible speck of dirt or\ndust in it, from the faces of Quebec and Malta to the bright tin pots\nand pannikins upon the dresser shelves--Mr. George is becoming\nthoughtful, sitting here while Mrs. Bagnet is busy, when Mr. Bagnet\nand young Woolwich opportunely come home. Mr. Bagnet is an\nex-artilleryman, tall and upright, with shaggy eyebrows and whiskers\nlike the fibres of a coco-nut, not a hair upon his head, and a torrid\ncomplexion. His voice, short, deep, and resonant, is not at all\nunlike the tones of the instrument to which he is devoted. Indeed\nthere may be generally observed in him an unbending, unyielding,\nbrass-bound air, as if he were himself the bassoon of the human\norchestra. Young Woolwich is the type and model of a young drummer.\n\nBoth father and son salute the trooper heartily. He saying, in due\nseason, that he has come to advise with Mr. Bagnet, Mr. Bagnet\nhospitably declares that he will hear of no business until after\ndinner and that his friend shall not partake of his counsel without\nfirst partaking of boiled pork and greens. The trooper yielding to\nthis invitation, he and Mr. Bagnet, not to embarrass the domestic\npreparations, go forth to take a turn up and down the little street,\nwhich they promenade with measured tread and folded arms, as if it\nwere a rampart.\n\n\"George,\" says Mr. Bagnet. \"You know me. It's my old girl that\nadvises. She has the head. But I never own to it before her.\nDiscipline must be maintained. Wait till the greens is off her mind.\nThen we'll consult. Whatever the old girl says, do--do it!\"\n\n\"I intend to, Mat,\" replies the other. \"I would sooner take her\nopinion than that of a college.\"\n\n\"College,\" returns Mr. Bagnet in short sentences, bassoon-like. \"What\ncollege could you leave--in another quarter of the world--with\nnothing but a grey cloak and an umbrella--to make its way home to\nEurope? The old girl would do it to-morrow. Did it once!\"\n\n\"You are right,\" says Mr. George.\n\n\"What college,\" pursues Bagnet, \"could you set up in life--with two\npenn'orth of white lime--a penn'orth of fuller's earth--a ha'porth of\nsand--and the rest of the change out of sixpence in money? That's\nwhat the old girl started on. In the present business.\"\n\n\"I am rejoiced to hear it's thriving, Mat.\"\n\n\"The old girl,\" says Mr. Bagnet, acquiescing, \"saves. Has a stocking\nsomewhere. With money in it. I never saw it. But I know she's got it.\nWait till the greens is off her mind. Then she'll set you up.\"\n\n\"She is a treasure!\" exclaims Mr. George.\n\n\"She's more. But I never own to it before her. Discipline must be\nmaintained. It was the old girl that brought out my musical\nabilities. I should have been in the artillery now but for the old\ngirl. Six years I hammered at the fiddle. Ten at the flute. The old\ngirl said it wouldn't do; intention good, but want of flexibility;\ntry the bassoon. The old girl borrowed a bassoon from the bandmaster\nof the Rifle Regiment. I practised in the trenches. Got on, got\nanother, get a living by it!\"\n\nGeorge remarks that she looks as fresh as a rose and as sound as an\napple.\n\n\"The old girl,\" says Mr. Bagnet in reply, \"is a thoroughly fine\nwoman. Consequently she is like a thoroughly fine day. Gets finer as\nshe gets on. I never saw the old girl's equal. But I never own to it\nbefore her. Discipline must be maintained!\"\n\nProceeding to converse on indifferent matters, they walk up and down\nthe little street, keeping step and time, until summoned by Quebec\nand Malta to do justice to the pork and greens, over which Mrs.\nBagnet, like a military chaplain, says a short grace. In the\ndistribution of these comestibles, as in every other household duty,\nMrs. Bagnet developes an exact system, sitting with every dish before\nher, allotting to every portion of pork its own portion of\npot-liquor, greens, potatoes, and even mustard, and serving it out\ncomplete. Having likewise served out the beer from a can and thus\nsupplied the mess with all things necessary, Mrs. Bagnet proceeds to\nsatisfy her own hunger, which is in a healthy state. The kit of the\nmess, if the table furniture may be so denominated, is chiefly\ncomposed of utensils of horn and tin that have done duty in several\nparts of the world. Young Woolwich's knife, in particular, which is\nof the oyster kind, with the additional feature of a strong\nshutting-up movement which frequently balks the appetite of that\nyoung musician, is mentioned as having gone in various hands the\ncomplete round of foreign service.\n\nThe dinner done, Mrs. Bagnet, assisted by the younger branches (who\npolish their own cups and platters, knives and forks), makes all the\ndinner garniture shine as brightly as before and puts it all away,\nfirst sweeping the hearth, to the end that Mr. Bagnet and the visitor\nmay not be retarded in the smoking of their pipes. These household\ncares involve much pattening and counter-pattening in the backyard\nand considerable use of a pail, which is finally so happy as to\nassist in the ablutions of Mrs. Bagnet herself. That old girl\nreappearing by and by, quite fresh, and sitting down to her\nneedlework, then and only then--the greens being only then to be\nconsidered as entirely off her mind--Mr. Bagnet requests the trooper\nto state his case.\n\nThis Mr. George does with great discretion, appearing to address\nhimself to Mr. Bagnet, but having an eye solely on the old girl all\nthe time, as Bagnet has himself. She, equally discreet, busies\nherself with her needlework. The case fully stated, Mr. Bagnet\nresorts to his standard artifice for the maintenance of discipline.\n\n\"That's the whole of it, is it, George?\" says he.\n\n\"That's the whole of it.\"\n\n\"You act according to my opinion?\"\n\n\"I shall be guided,\" replies George, \"entirely by it.\"\n\n\"Old girl,\" says Mr. Bagnet, \"give him my opinion. You know it. Tell\nhim what it is.\"\n\nIt is that he cannot have too little to do with people who are too\ndeep for him and cannot be too careful of interference with matters\nhe does not understand--that the plain rule is to do nothing in the\ndark, to be a party to nothing underhanded or mysterious, and never\nto put his foot where he cannot see the ground. This, in effect, is\nMr. Bagnet's opinion, as delivered through the old girl, and it so\nrelieves Mr. George's mind by confirming his own opinion and\nbanishing his doubts that he composes himself to smoke another pipe\non that exceptional occasion and to have a talk over old times with\nthe whole Bagnet family, according to their various ranges of\nexperience.\n\nThrough these means it comes to pass that Mr. George does not again\nrise to his full height in that parlour until the time is drawing on\nwhen the bassoon and fife are expected by a British public at the\ntheatre; and as it takes time even then for Mr. George, in his\ndomestic character of Bluffy, to take leave of Quebec and Malta and\ninsinuate a sponsorial shilling into the pocket of his godson with\nfelicitations on his success in life, it is dark when Mr. George\nagain turns his face towards Lincoln's Inn Fields.\n\n\"A family home,\" he ruminates as he marches along, \"however small it\nis, makes a man like me look lonely. But it's well I never made that\nevolution of matrimony. I shouldn't have been fit for it. I am such a\nvagabond still, even at my present time of life, that I couldn't hold\nto the gallery a month together if it was a regular pursuit or if I\ndidn't camp there, gipsy fashion. Come! I disgrace nobody and cumber\nnobody; that's something. I have not done that for many a long year!\"\n\nSo he whistles it off and marches on.\n\nArrived in Lincoln's Inn Fields and mounting Mr. Tulkinghorn's stair,\nhe finds the outer door closed and the chambers shut, but the trooper\nnot knowing much about outer doors, and the staircase being dark\nbesides, he is yet fumbling and groping about, hoping to discover a\nbell-handle or to open the door for himself, when Mr. Tulkinghorn\ncomes up the stairs (quietly, of course) and angrily asks, \"Who is\nthat? What are you doing there?\"\n\n\"I ask your pardon, sir. It's George. The sergeant.\"\n\n\"And couldn't George, the sergeant, see that my door was locked?\"\n\n\"Why, no, sir, I couldn't. At any rate, I didn't,\" says the trooper,\nrather nettled.\n\n\"Have you changed your mind? Or are you in the same mind?\" Mr.\nTulkinghorn demands. But he knows well enough at a glance.\n\n\"In the same mind, sir.\"\n\n\"I thought so. That's sufficient. You can go. So you are the man,\"\nsays Mr. Tulkinghorn, opening his door with the key, \"in whose\nhiding-place Mr. Gridley was found?\"\n\n\"Yes, I AM the man,\" says the trooper, stopping two or three stairs\ndown. \"What then, sir?\"\n\n\"What then? I don't like your associates. You should not have seen\nthe inside of my door this morning if I had thought of your being\nthat man. Gridley? A threatening, murderous, dangerous fellow.\"\n\nWith these words, spoken in an unusually high tone for him, the\nlawyer goes into his rooms and shuts the door with a thundering\nnoise.\n\nMr. George takes his dismissal in great dudgeon, the greater because\na clerk coming up the stairs has heard the last words of all and\nevidently applies them to him. \"A pretty character to bear,\" the\ntrooper growls with a hasty oath as he strides downstairs. \"A\nthreatening, murderous, dangerous fellow!\" And looking up, he sees\nthe clerk looking down at him and marking him as he passes a lamp.\nThis so intensifies his dudgeon that for five minutes he is in an ill\nhumour. But he whistles that off like the rest of it and marches home\nto the shooting gallery.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVIII\n\nThe Ironmaster\n\n\nSir Leicester Dedlock has got the better, for the time being, of the\nfamily gout and is once more, in a literal no less than in a\nfigurative point of view, upon his legs. He is at his place in\nLincolnshire; but the waters are out again on the low-lying grounds,\nand the cold and damp steal into Chesney Wold, though well defended,\nand eke into Sir Leicester's bones. The blazing fires of faggot and\ncoal--Dedlock timber and antediluvian forest--that blaze upon the\nbroad wide hearths and wink in the twilight on the frowning woods,\nsullen to see how trees are sacrificed, do not exclude the enemy. The\nhot-water pipes that trail themselves all over the house, the\ncushioned doors and windows, and the screens and curtains fail to\nsupply the fires' deficiencies and to satisfy Sir Leicester's need.\nHence the fashionable intelligence proclaims one morning to the\nlistening earth that Lady Dedlock is expected shortly to return to\ntown for a few weeks.\n\nIt is a melancholy truth that even great men have their poor\nrelations. Indeed great men have often more than their fair share of\npoor relations, inasmuch as very red blood of the superior quality,\nlike inferior blood unlawfully shed, WILL cry aloud and WILL be\nheard. Sir Leicester's cousins, in the remotest degree, are so many\nmurders in the respect that they \"will out.\" Among whom there are\ncousins who are so poor that one might almost dare to think it would\nhave been the happier for them never to have been plated links upon\nthe Dedlock chain of gold, but to have been made of common iron at\nfirst and done base service.\n\nService, however (with a few limited reservations, genteel but not\nprofitable), they may not do, being of the Dedlock dignity. So they\nvisit their richer cousins, and get into debt when they can, and live\nbut shabbily when they can't, and find--the women no husbands, and\nthe men no wives--and ride in borrowed carriages, and sit at feasts\nthat are never of their own making, and so go through high life. The\nrich family sum has been divided by so many figures, and they are the\nsomething over that nobody knows what to do with.\n\nEverybody on Sir Leicester Dedlock's side of the question and of his\nway of thinking would appear to be his cousin more or less. From my\nLord Boodle, through the Duke of Foodle, down to Noodle, Sir\nLeicester, like a glorious spider, stretches his threads of\nrelationship. But while he is stately in the cousinship of the\nEverybodys, he is a kind and generous man, according to his dignified\nway, in the cousinship of the Nobodys; and at the present time, in\ndespite of the damp, he stays out the visit of several such cousins\nat Chesney Wold with the constancy of a martyr.\n\nOf these, foremost in the front rank stands Volumnia Dedlock, a young\nlady (of sixty) who is doubly highly related, having the honour to be\na poor relation, by the mother's side, to another great family. Miss\nVolumnia, displaying in early life a pretty talent for cutting\nornaments out of coloured paper, and also for singing to the guitar\nin the Spanish tongue, and propounding French conundrums in country\nhouses, passed the twenty years of her existence between twenty and\nforty in a sufficiently agreeable manner. Lapsing then out of date\nand being considered to bore mankind by her vocal performances in the\nSpanish language, she retired to Bath, where she lives slenderly on\nan annual present from Sir Leicester and whence she makes occasional\nresurrections in the country houses of her cousins. She has an\nextensive acquaintance at Bath among appalling old gentlemen with\nthin legs and nankeen trousers, and is of high standing in that\ndreary city. But she is a little dreaded elsewhere in consequence of\nan indiscreet profusion in the article of rouge and persistency in an\nobsolete pearl necklace like a rosary of little bird's-eggs.\n\nIn any country in a wholesome state, Volumnia would be a clear case\nfor the pension list. Efforts have been made to get her on it, and\nwhen William Buffy came in, it was fully expected that her name would\nbe put down for a couple of hundred a year. But William Buffy somehow\ndiscovered, contrary to all expectation, that these were not the\ntimes when it could be done, and this was the first clear indication\nSir Leicester Dedlock had conveyed to him that the country was going\nto pieces.\n\nThere is likewise the Honourable Bob Stables, who can make warm\nmashes with the skill of a veterinary surgeon and is a better shot\nthan most gamekeepers. He has been for some time particularly\ndesirous to serve his country in a post of good emoluments,\nunaccompanied by any trouble or responsibility. In a well-regulated\nbody politic this natural desire on the part of a spirited young\ngentleman so highly connected would be speedily recognized, but\nsomehow William Buffy found when he came in that these were not times\nin which he could manage that little matter either, and this was the\nsecond indication Sir Leicester Dedlock had conveyed to him that the\ncountry was going to pieces.\n\nThe rest of the cousins are ladies and gentlemen of various ages and\ncapacities, the major part amiable and sensible and likely to have\ndone well enough in life if they could have overcome their\ncousinship; as it is, they are almost all a little worsted by it, and\nlounge in purposeless and listless paths, and seem to be quite as\nmuch at a loss how to dispose of themselves as anybody else can be\nhow to dispose of them.\n\nIn this society, and where not, my Lady Dedlock reigns supreme.\nBeautiful, elegant, accomplished, and powerful in her little world\n(for the world of fashion does not stretch ALL the way from pole to\npole), her influence in Sir Leicester's house, however haughty and\nindifferent her manner, is greatly to improve it and refine it. The\ncousins, even those older cousins who were paralysed when Sir\nLeicester married her, do her feudal homage; and the Honourable Bob\nStables daily repeats to some chosen person between breakfast and\nlunch his favourite original remark, that she is the best-groomed\nwoman in the whole stud.\n\nSuch the guests in the long drawing-room at Chesney Wold this dismal\nnight when the step on the Ghost's Walk (inaudible here, however)\nmight be the step of a deceased cousin shut out in the cold. It is\nnear bed-time. Bedroom fires blaze brightly all over the house,\nraising ghosts of grim furniture on wall and ceiling. Bedroom\ncandlesticks bristle on the distant table by the door, and cousins\nyawn on ottomans. Cousins at the piano, cousins at the soda-water\ntray, cousins rising from the card-table, cousins gathered round the\nfire. Standing on one side of his own peculiar fire (for there are\ntwo), Sir Leicester. On the opposite side of the broad hearth, my\nLady at her table. Volumnia, as one of the more privileged cousins,\nin a luxurious chair between them. Sir Leicester glancing, with\nmagnificent displeasure, at the rouge and the pearl necklace.\n\n\"I occasionally meet on my staircase here,\" drawls Volumnia, whose\nthoughts perhaps are already hopping up it to bed, after a long\nevening of very desultory talk, \"one of the prettiest girls, I think,\nthat I ever saw in my life.\"\n\n\"A PROTEGEE of my Lady's,\" observes Sir Leicester.\n\n\"I thought so. I felt sure that some uncommon eye must have picked\nthat girl out. She really is a marvel. A dolly sort of beauty\nperhaps,\" says Miss Volumnia, reserving her own sort, \"but in its\nway, perfect; such bloom I never saw!\"\n\nSir Leicester, with his magnificent glance of displeasure at the\nrouge, appears to say so too.\n\n\"Indeed,\" remarks my Lady languidly, \"if there is any uncommon eye in\nthe case, it is Mrs. Rouncewell's, and not mine. Rosa is her\ndiscovery.\"\n\n\"Your maid, I suppose?\"\n\n\"No. My anything; pet--secretary--messenger--I don't know what.\"\n\n\"You like to have her about you, as you would like to have a flower,\nor a bird, or a picture, or a poodle--no, not a poodle, though--or\nanything else that was equally pretty?\" says Volumnia, sympathizing.\n\"Yes, how charming now! And how well that delightful old soul Mrs.\nRouncewell is looking. She must be an immense age, and yet she is as\nactive and handsome! She is the dearest friend I have, positively!\"\n\nSir Leicester feels it to be right and fitting that the housekeeper\nof Chesney Wold should be a remarkable person. Apart from that, he\nhas a real regard for Mrs. Rouncewell and likes to hear her praised.\nSo he says, \"You are right, Volumnia,\" which Volumnia is extremely\nglad to hear.\n\n\"She has no daughter of her own, has she?\"\n\n\"Mrs. Rouncewell? No, Volumnia. She has a son. Indeed, she had two.\"\n\nMy Lady, whose chronic malady of boredom has been sadly aggravated by\nVolumnia this evening, glances wearily towards the candlesticks and\nheaves a noiseless sigh.\n\n\"And it is a remarkable example of the confusion into which the\npresent age has fallen; of the obliteration of landmarks, the opening\nof floodgates, and the uprooting of distinctions,\" says Sir Leicester\nwith stately gloom, \"that I have been informed by Mr. Tulkinghorn\nthat Mrs. Rouncewell's son has been invited to go into Parliament.\"\n\nMiss Volumnia utters a little sharp scream.\n\n\"Yes, indeed,\" repeats Sir Leicester. \"Into Parliament.\"\n\n\"I never heard of such a thing! Good gracious, what is the man?\"\nexclaims Volumnia.\n\n\"He is called, I believe--an--ironmaster.\" Sir Leicester says it\nslowly and with gravity and doubt, as not being sure but that he is\ncalled a lead-mistress or that the right word may be some other word\nexpressive of some other relationship to some other metal.\n\nVolumnia utters another little scream.\n\n\"He has declined the proposal, if my information from Mr. Tulkinghorn\nbe correct, as I have no doubt it is. Mr. Tulkinghorn being always\ncorrect and exact; still that does not,\" says Sir Leicester, \"that\ndoes not lessen the anomaly, which is fraught with strange\nconsiderations--startling considerations, as it appears to me.\"\n\nMiss Volumnia rising with a look candlestick-wards, Sir Leicester\npolitely performs the grand tour of the drawing-room, brings one, and\nlights it at my Lady's shaded lamp.\n\n\"I must beg you, my Lady,\" he says while doing so, \"to remain a few\nmoments, for this individual of whom I speak arrived this evening\nshortly before dinner and requested in a very becoming note\"--Sir\nLeicester, with his habitual regard to truth, dwells upon it--\"I am\nbound to say, in a very becoming and well-expressed note, the favour\nof a short interview with yourself and MYself on the subject of this\nyoung girl. As it appeared that he wished to depart to-night, I\nreplied that we would see him before retiring.\"\n\nMiss Volumnia with a third little scream takes flight, wishing her\nhosts--O Lud!--well rid of the--what is it?--ironmaster!\n\nThe other cousins soon disperse, to the last cousin there. Sir\nLeicester rings the bell, \"Make my compliments to Mr. Rouncewell, in\nthe housekeeper's apartments, and say I can receive him now.\"\n\nMy Lady, who has heard all this with slight attention outwardly,\nlooks towards Mr. Rouncewell as he comes in. He is a little over\nfifty perhaps, of a good figure, like his mother, and has a clear\nvoice, a broad forehead from which his dark hair has retired, and a\nshrewd though open face. He is a responsible-looking gentleman\ndressed in black, portly enough, but strong and active. Has a\nperfectly natural and easy air and is not in the least embarrassed by\nthe great presence into which he comes.\n\n\"Sir Leicester and Lady Dedlock, as I have already apologized for\nintruding on you, I cannot do better than be very brief. I thank you,\nSir Leicester.\"\n\nThe head of the Dedlocks has motioned towards a sofa between himself\nand my Lady. Mr. Rouncewell quietly takes his seat there.\n\n\"In these busy times, when so many great undertakings are in\nprogress, people like myself have so many workmen in so many places\nthat we are always on the flight.\"\n\nSir Leicester is content enough that the ironmaster should feel that\nthere is no hurry there; there, in that ancient house, rooted in that\nquiet park, where the ivy and the moss have had time to mature, and\nthe gnarled and warted elms and the umbrageous oaks stand deep in the\nfern and leaves of a hundred years; and where the sun-dial on the\nterrace has dumbly recorded for centuries that time which was as much\nthe property of every Dedlock--while he lasted--as the house and\nlands. Sir Leicester sits down in an easy-chair, opposing his repose\nand that of Chesney Wold to the restless flights of ironmasters.\n\n\"Lady Dedlock has been so kind,\" proceeds Mr. Rouncewell with a\nrespectful glance and a bow that way, \"as to place near her a young\nbeauty of the name of Rosa. Now, my son has fallen in love with Rosa\nand has asked my consent to his proposing marriage to her and to\ntheir becoming engaged if she will take him--which I suppose she\nwill. I have never seen Rosa until to-day, but I have some confidence\nin my son's good sense--even in love. I find her what he represents\nher, to the best of my judgment; and my mother speaks of her with\ngreat commendation.\"\n\n\"She in all respects deserves it,\" says my Lady.\n\n\"I am happy, Lady Dedlock, that you say so, and I need not comment on\nthe value to me of your kind opinion of her.\"\n\n\"That,\" observes Sir Leicester with unspeakable grandeur, for he\nthinks the ironmaster a little too glib, \"must be quite unnecessary.\"\n\n\"Quite unnecessary, Sir Leicester. Now, my son is a very young man,\nand Rosa is a very young woman. As I made my way, so my son must make\nhis; and his being married at present is out of the question. But\nsupposing I gave my consent to his engaging himself to this pretty\ngirl, if this pretty girl will engage herself to him, I think it a\npiece of candour to say at once--I am sure, Sir Leicester and Lady\nDedlock, you will understand and excuse me--I should make it a\ncondition that she did not remain at Chesney Wold. Therefore, before\ncommunicating further with my son, I take the liberty of saying that\nif her removal would be in any way inconvenient or objectionable, I\nwill hold the matter over with him for any reasonable time and leave\nit precisely where it is.\"\n\nNot remain at Chesney Wold! Make it a condition! All Sir Leicester's\nold misgivings relative to Wat Tyler and the people in the iron\ndistricts who do nothing but turn out by torchlight come in a shower\nupon his head, the fine grey hair of which, as well as of his\nwhiskers, actually stirs with indignation.\n\n\"Am I to understand, sir,\" says Sir Leicester, \"and is my Lady to\nunderstand\"--he brings her in thus specially, first as a point of\ngallantry, and next as a point of prudence, having great reliance on\nher sense--\"am I to understand, Mr. Rouncewell, and is my Lady to\nunderstand, sir, that you consider this young woman too good for\nChesney Wold or likely to be injured by remaining here?\"\n\n\"Certainly not, Sir Leicester,\"\n\n\"I am glad to hear it.\" Sir Leicester very lofty indeed.\n\n\"Pray, Mr. Rouncewell,\" says my Lady, warning Sir Leicester off with\nthe slightest gesture of her pretty hand, as if he were a fly,\n\"explain to me what you mean.\"\n\n\"Willingly, Lady Dedlock. There is nothing I could desire more.\"\n\nAddressing her composed face, whose intelligence, however, is too\nquick and active to be concealed by any studied impassiveness,\nhowever habitual, to the strong Saxon face of the visitor, a picture\nof resolution and perseverance, my Lady listens with attention,\noccasionally slightly bending her head.\n\n\"I am the son of your housekeeper, Lady Dedlock, and passed my\nchildhood about this house. My mother has lived here half a\ncentury and will die here I have no doubt. She is one of those\nexamples--perhaps as good a one as there is--of love, and attachment,\nand fidelity in such a nation, which England may well be proud of,\nbut of which no order can appropriate the whole pride or the whole\nmerit, because such an instance bespeaks high worth on two sides--on\nthe great side assuredly, on the small one no less assuredly.\"\n\nSir Leicester snorts a little to hear the law laid down in this way,\nbut in his honour and his love of truth, he freely, though silently,\nadmits the justice of the ironmaster's proposition.\n\n\"Pardon me for saying what is so obvious, but I wouldn't have it\nhastily supposed,\" with the least turn of his eyes towards Sir\nLeicester, \"that I am ashamed of my mother's position here, or\nwanting in all just respect for Chesney Wold and the family.\nI certainly may have desired--I certainly have desired, Lady\nDedlock--that my mother should retire after so many years and end\nher days with me. But as I have found that to sever this strong bond\nwould be to break her heart, I have long abandoned that idea.\"\n\nSir Leicester very magnificent again at the notion of Mrs. Rouncewell\nbeing spirited off from her natural home to end her days with an\nironmaster.\n\n\"I have been,\" proceeds the visitor in a modest, clear way, \"an\napprentice and a workman. I have lived on workman's wages, years and\nyears, and beyond a certain point have had to educate myself. My wife\nwas a foreman's daughter, and plainly brought up. We have three\ndaughters besides this son of whom I have spoken, and being\nfortunately able to give them greater advantages than we have had\nourselves, we have educated them well, very well. It has been one of\nour great cares and pleasures to make them worthy of any station.\"\n\nA little boastfulness in his fatherly tone here, as if he added in\nhis heart, \"even of the Chesney Wold station.\" Not a little more\nmagnificence, therefore, on the part of Sir Leicester.\n\n\"All this is so frequent, Lady Dedlock, where I live, and among the\nclass to which I belong, that what would be generally called unequal\nmarriages are not of such rare occurrence with us as elsewhere. A son\nwill sometimes make it known to his father that he has fallen in\nlove, say, with a young woman in the factory. The father, who once\nworked in a factory himself, will be a little disappointed at first\nvery possibly. It may be that he had other views for his son.\nHowever, the chances are that having ascertained the young woman to\nbe of unblemished character, he will say to his son, 'I must be quite\nsure you are in earnest here. This is a serious matter for both of\nyou. Therefore I shall have this girl educated for two years,' or it\nmay be, 'I shall place this girl at the same school with your sisters\nfor such a time, during which you will give me your word and honour\nto see her only so often. If at the expiration of that time, when she\nhas so far profited by her advantages as that you may be upon a fair\nequality, you are both in the same mind, I will do my part to make\nyou happy.' I know of several cases such as I describe, my Lady, and\nI think they indicate to me my own course now.\"\n\nSir Leicester's magnificence explodes. Calmly, but terribly.\n\n\"Mr. Rouncewell,\" says Sir Leicester with his right hand in the\nbreast of his blue coat, the attitude of state in which he is painted\nin the gallery, \"do you draw a parallel between Chesney Wold and a--\"\nHere he resists a disposition to choke, \"a factory?\"\n\n\"I need not reply, Sir Leicester, that the two places are very\ndifferent; but for the purposes of this case, I think a parallel may\nbe justly drawn between them.\"\n\nSir Leicester directs his majestic glance down one side of the long\ndrawing-room and up the other before he can believe that he is awake.\n\n\"Are you aware, sir, that this young woman whom my Lady--my Lady--has\nplaced near her person was brought up at the village school outside\nthe gates?\"\n\n\"Sir Leicester, I am quite aware of it. A very good school it is, and\nhandsomely supported by this family.\"\n\n\"Then, Mr. Rouncewell,\" returns Sir Leicester, \"the application of\nwhat you have said is, to me, incomprehensible.\"\n\n\"Will it be more comprehensible, Sir Leicester, if I say,\" the\nironmaster is reddening a little, \"that I do not regard the village\nschool as teaching everything desirable to be known by my son's\nwife?\"\n\nFrom the village school of Chesney Wold, intact as it is this minute,\nto the whole framework of society; from the whole framework of\nsociety, to the aforesaid framework receiving tremendous cracks in\nconsequence of people (iron-masters, lead-mistresses, and what not)\nnot minding their catechism, and getting out of the station unto\nwhich they are called--necessarily and for ever, according to Sir\nLeicester's rapid logic, the first station in which they happen to\nfind themselves; and from that, to their educating other people out\nof THEIR stations, and so obliterating the landmarks, and opening the\nfloodgates, and all the rest of it; this is the swift progress of the\nDedlock mind.\n\n\"My Lady, I beg your pardon. Permit me, for one moment!\" She has\ngiven a faint indication of intending to speak. \"Mr. Rouncewell, our\nviews of duty, and our views of station, and our views of education,\nand our views of--in short, ALL our views--are so diametrically\nopposed, that to prolong this discussion must be repellent to your\nfeelings and repellent to my own. This young woman is honoured with\nmy Lady's notice and favour. If she wishes to withdraw herself from\nthat notice and favour or if she chooses to place herself under the\ninfluence of any one who may in his peculiar opinions--you will allow\nme to say, in his peculiar opinions, though I readily admit that he\nis not accountable for them to me--who may, in his peculiar opinions,\nwithdraw her from that notice and favour, she is at any time at\nliberty to do so. We are obliged to you for the plainness with which\nyou have spoken. It will have no effect of itself, one way or other,\non the young woman's position here. Beyond this, we can make no\nterms; and here we beg--if you will be so good--to leave the\nsubject.\"\n\nThe visitor pauses a moment to give my Lady an opportunity, but she\nsays nothing. He then rises and replies, \"Sir Leicester and Lady\nDedlock, allow me to thank you for your attention and only to observe\nthat I shall very seriously recommend my son to conquer his present\ninclinations. Good night!\"\n\n\"Mr. Rouncewell,\" says Sir Leicester with all the nature of a\ngentleman shining in him, \"it is late, and the roads are dark. I hope\nyour time is not so precious but that you will allow my Lady and\nmyself to offer you the hospitality of Chesney Wold, for to-night at\nleast.\"\n\n\"I hope so,\" adds my Lady.\n\n\"I am much obliged to you, but I have to travel all night in order to\nreach a distant part of the country punctually at an appointed time\nin the morning.\"\n\nTherewith the ironmaster takes his departure, Sir Leicester ringing\nthe bell and my Lady rising as he leaves the room.\n\nWhen my Lady goes to her boudoir, she sits down thoughtfully by the\nfire, and inattentive to the Ghost's Walk, looks at Rosa, writing in\nan inner room. Presently my Lady calls her.\n\n\"Come to me, child. Tell me the truth. Are you in love?\"\n\n\"Oh! My Lady!\"\n\nMy Lady, looking at the downcast and blushing face, says smiling,\n\"Who is it? Is it Mrs. Rouncewell's grandson?\"\n\n\"Yes, if you please, my Lady. But I don't know that I am in love with\nhim--yet.\"\n\n\"Yet, you silly little thing! Do you know that he loves YOU, yet?\"\n\n\"I think he likes me a little, my Lady.\" And Rosa bursts into tears.\n\nIs this Lady Dedlock standing beside the village beauty, smoothing\nher dark hair with that motherly touch, and watching her with eyes so\nfull of musing interest? Aye, indeed it is!\n\n\"Listen to me, child. You are young and true, and I believe you are\nattached to me.\"\n\n\"Indeed I am, my Lady. Indeed there is nothing in the world I\nwouldn't do to show how much.\"\n\n\"And I don't think you would wish to leave me just yet, Rosa, even\nfor a lover?\"\n\n\"No, my Lady! Oh, no!\" Rosa looks up for the first time, quite\nfrightened at the thought.\n\n\"Confide in me, my child. Don't fear me. I wish you to be happy, and\nwill make you so--if I can make anybody happy on this earth.\"\n\nRosa, with fresh tears, kneels at her feet and kisses her hand. My\nLady takes the hand with which she has caught it, and standing with\nher eyes fixed on the fire, puts it about and about between her own\ntwo hands, and gradually lets it fall. Seeing her so absorbed, Rosa\nsoftly withdraws; but still my Lady's eyes are on the fire.\n\nIn search of what? Of any hand that is no more, of any hand that\nnever was, of any touch that might have magically changed her life?\nOr does she listen to the Ghost's Walk and think what step does it\nmost resemble? A man's? A woman's? The pattering of a little child's\nfeet, ever coming on--on--on? Some melancholy influence is upon her,\nor why should so proud a lady close the doors and sit alone upon the\nhearth so desolate?\n\nVolumnia is away next day, and all the cousins are scattered before\ndinner. Not a cousin of the batch but is amazed to hear from Sir\nLeicester at breakfast-time of the obliteration of landmarks, and\nopening of floodgates, and cracking of the framework of society,\nmanifested through Mrs. Rouncewell's son. Not a cousin of the batch\nbut is really indignant, and connects it with the feebleness of\nWilliam Buffy when in office, and really does feel deprived of a\nstake in the country--or the pension list--or something--by fraud and\nwrong. As to Volumnia, she is handed down the great staircase by Sir\nLeicester, as eloquent upon the theme as if there were a general\nrising in the north of England to obtain her rouge-pot and pearl\nnecklace. And thus, with a clatter of maids and valets--for it is one\nappurtenance of their cousinship that however difficult they may find\nit to keep themselves, they MUST keep maids and valets--the cousins\ndisperse to the four winds of heaven; and the one wintry wind that\nblows to-day shakes a shower from the trees near the deserted house,\nas if all the cousins had been changed into leaves.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIX\n\nThe Young Man\n\n\nChesney Wold is shut up, carpets are rolled into great scrolls in\ncorners of comfortless rooms, bright damask does penance in brown\nholland, carving and gilding puts on mortification, and the Dedlock\nancestors retire from the light of day again. Around and around the\nhouse the leaves fall thick, but never fast, for they come circling\ndown with a dead lightness that is sombre and slow. Let the gardener\nsweep and sweep the turf as he will, and press the leaves into full\nbarrows, and wheel them off, still they lie ankle-deep. Howls the\nshrill wind round Chesney Wold; the sharp rain beats, the windows\nrattle, and the chimneys growl. Mists hide in the avenues, veil the\npoints of view, and move in funeral-wise across the rising grounds.\nOn all the house there is a cold, blank smell like the smell of a\nlittle church, though something dryer, suggesting that the dead and\nburied Dedlocks walk there in the long nights and leave the flavour\nof their graves behind them.\n\nBut the house in town, which is rarely in the same mind as Chesney\nWold at the same time, seldom rejoicing when it rejoices or mourning\nwhen it mourns, excepting when a Dedlock dies--the house in town\nshines out awakened. As warm and bright as so much state may be, as\ndelicately redolent of pleasant scents that bear no trace of winter\nas hothouse flowers can make it, soft and hushed so that the ticking\nof the clocks and the crisp burning of the fires alone disturb the\nstillness in the rooms, it seems to wrap those chilled bones of Sir\nLeicester's in rainbow-coloured wool. And Sir Leicester is glad to\nrepose in dignified contentment before the great fire in the library,\ncondescendingly perusing the backs of his books or honouring the fine\narts with a glance of approbation. For he has his pictures, ancient\nand modern. Some of the Fancy Ball School in which art occasionally\ncondescends to become a master, which would be best catalogued like\nthe miscellaneous articles in a sale. As \"Three high-backed chairs, a\ntable and cover, long-necked bottle (containing wine), one flask, one\nSpanish female's costume, three-quarter face portrait of Miss Jogg\nthe model, and a suit of armour containing Don Quixote.\" Or \"One\nstone terrace (cracked), one gondola in distance, one Venetian\nsenator's dress complete, richly embroidered white satin costume with\nprofile portrait of Miss Jogg the model, one Scimitar superbly\nmounted in gold with jewelled handle, elaborate Moorish dress (very\nrare), and Othello.\"\n\nMr. Tulkinghorn comes and goes pretty often, there being estate\nbusiness to do, leases to be renewed, and so on. He sees my Lady\npretty often, too; and he and she are as composed, and as\nindifferent, and take as little heed of one another, as ever. Yet it\nmay be that my Lady fears this Mr. Tulkinghorn and that he knows it.\nIt may be that he pursues her doggedly and steadily, with no touch of\ncompunction, remorse, or pity. It may be that her beauty and all the\nstate and brilliancy surrounding her only gives him the greater zest\nfor what he is set upon and makes him the more inflexible in it.\nWhether he be cold and cruel, whether immovable in what he has made\nhis duty, whether absorbed in love of power, whether determined\nto have nothing hidden from him in ground where he has burrowed\namong secrets all his life, whether he in his heart despises the\nsplendour of which he is a distant beam, whether he is always\ntreasuring up slights and offences in the affability of his gorgeous\nclients--whether he be any of this, or all of this, it may be that my\nLady had better have five thousand pairs of fashionable eyes upon\nher, in distrustful vigilance, than the two eyes of this rusty lawyer\nwith his wisp of neckcloth and his dull black breeches tied with\nribbons at the knees.\n\nSir Leicester sits in my Lady's room--that room in which Mr.\nTulkinghorn read the affidavit in Jarndyce and Jarndyce--particularly\ncomplacent. My Lady, as on that day, sits before the fire with her\nscreen in her hand. Sir Leicester is particularly complacent because\nhe has found in his newspaper some congenial remarks bearing directly\non the floodgates and the framework of society. They apply so happily\nto the late case that Sir Leicester has come from the library to my\nLady's room expressly to read them aloud. \"The man who wrote this\narticle,\" he observes by way of preface, nodding at the fire as if he\nwere nodding down at the man from a mount, \"has a well-balanced\nmind.\"\n\nThe man's mind is not so well balanced but that he bores my Lady,\nwho, after a languid effort to listen, or rather a languid\nresignation of herself to a show of listening, becomes distraught and\nfalls into a contemplation of the fire as if it were her fire at\nChesney Wold, and she had never left it. Sir Leicester, quite\nunconscious, reads on through his double eye-glass, occasionally\nstopping to remove his glass and express approval, as \"Very true\nindeed,\" \"Very properly put,\" \"I have frequently made the same remark\nmyself,\" invariably losing his place after each observation, and\ngoing up and down the column to find it again.\n\nSir Leicester is reading with infinite gravity and state when the\ndoor opens, and the Mercury in powder makes this strange\nannouncement, \"The young man, my Lady, of the name of Guppy.\"\n\nSir Leicester pauses, stares, repeats in a killing voice, \"The young\nman of the name of Guppy?\"\n\nLooking round, he beholds the young man of the name of Guppy, much\ndiscomfited and not presenting a very impressive letter of\nintroduction in his manner and appearance.\n\n\"Pray,\" says Sir Leicester to Mercury, \"what do you mean by\nannouncing with this abruptness a young man of the name of Guppy?\"\n\n\"I beg your pardon, Sir Leicester, but my Lady said she would see the\nyoung man whenever he called. I was not aware that you were here, Sir\nLeicester.\"\n\nWith this apology, Mercury directs a scornful and indignant look at\nthe young man of the name of Guppy which plainly says, \"What do you\ncome calling here for and getting ME into a row?\"\n\n\"It's quite right. I gave him those directions,\" says my Lady. \"Let\nthe young man wait.\"\n\n\"By no means, my Lady. Since he has your orders to come, I will not\ninterrupt you.\" Sir Leicester in his gallantry retires, rather\ndeclining to accept a bow from the young man as he goes out and\nmajestically supposing him to be some shoemaker of intrusive\nappearance.\n\nLady Dedlock looks imperiously at her visitor when the servant has\nleft the room, casting her eyes over him from head to foot. She\nsuffers him to stand by the door and asks him what he wants.\n\n\"That your ladyship would have the kindness to oblige me with a\nlittle conversation,\" returns Mr. Guppy, embarrassed.\n\n\"You are, of course, the person who has written me so many letters?\"\n\n\"Several, your ladyship. Several before your ladyship condescended to\nfavour me with an answer.\"\n\n\"And could you not take the same means of rendering a Conversation\nunnecessary? Can you not still?\"\n\nMr. Guppy screws his mouth into a silent \"No!\" and shakes his head.\n\n\"You have been strangely importunate. If it should appear, after all,\nthat what you have to say does not concern me--and I don't know how\nit can, and don't expect that it will--you will allow me to cut you\nshort with but little ceremony. Say what you have to say, if you\nplease.\"\n\nMy Lady, with a careless toss of her screen, turns herself towards\nthe fire again, sitting almost with her back to the young man of the\nname of Guppy.\n\n\"With your ladyship's permission, then,\" says the young man, \"I will\nnow enter on my business. Hem! I am, as I told your ladyship in my\nfirst letter, in the law. Being in the law, I have learnt the habit\nof not committing myself in writing, and therefore I did not mention\nto your ladyship the name of the firm with which I am connected and\nin which my standing--and I may add income--is tolerably good. I may\nnow state to your ladyship, in confidence, that the name of that firm\nis Kenge and Carboy, of Lincoln's Inn, which may not be altogether\nunknown to your ladyship in connexion with the case in Chancery of\nJarndyce and Jarndyce.\"\n\nMy Lady's figure begins to be expressive of some attention. She has\nceased to toss the screen and holds it as if she were listening.\n\n\"Now, I may say to your ladyship at once,\" says Mr. Guppy, a little\nemboldened, \"it is no matter arising out of Jarndyce and Jarndyce\nthat made me so desirous to speak to your ladyship, which conduct I\nhave no doubt did appear, and does appear, obtrusive--in fact, almost\nblackguardly.\"\n\nAfter waiting for a moment to receive some assurance to the contrary,\nand not receiving any, Mr. Guppy proceeds, \"If it had been Jarndyce\nand Jarndyce, I should have gone at once to your ladyship's\nsolicitor, Mr. Tulkinghorn, of the Fields. I have the pleasure of\nbeing acquainted with Mr. Tulkinghorn--at least we move when we meet\none another--and if it had been any business of that sort, I should\nhave gone to him.\"\n\nMy Lady turns a little round and says, \"You had better sit down.\"\n\n\"Thank your ladyship.\" Mr. Guppy does so. \"Now, your ladyship\"--Mr.\nGuppy refers to a little slip of paper on which he has made small\nnotes of his line of argument and which seems to involve him in the\ndensest obscurity whenever he looks at it--\"I--Oh, yes!--I place\nmyself entirely in your ladyship's hands. If your ladyship was to\nmake any complaint to Kenge and Carboy or to Mr. Tulkinghorn of the\npresent visit, I should be placed in a very disagreeable situation.\nThat, I openly admit. Consequently, I rely upon your ladyship's\nhonour.\"\n\nMy Lady, with a disdainful gesture of the hand that holds the screen,\nassures him of his being worth no complaint from her.\n\n\"Thank your ladyship,\" says Mr. Guppy; \"quite satisfactory.\nNow--I--dash it!--The fact is that I put down a head or two here of\nthe order of the points I thought of touching upon, and they're\nwritten short, and I can't quite make out what they mean. If your\nladyship will excuse me taking it to the window half a moment, I--\"\n\nMr. Guppy, going to the window, tumbles into a pair of love-birds, to\nwhom he says in his confusion, \"I beg your pardon, I am sure.\" This\ndoes not tend to the greater legibility of his notes. He murmurs,\ngrowing warm and red and holding the slip of paper now close to his\neyes, now a long way off, \"C.S. What's C.S. for? Oh! C.S.! Oh, I\nknow! Yes, to be sure!\" And comes back enlightened.\n\n\"I am not aware,\" says Mr. Guppy, standing midway between my Lady and\nhis chair, \"whether your ladyship ever happened to hear of, or to\nsee, a young lady of the name of Miss Esther Summerson.\"\n\nMy Lady's eyes look at him full. \"I saw a young lady of that name not\nlong ago. This past autumn.\"\n\n\"Now, did it strike your ladyship that she was like anybody?\" asks\nMr. Guppy, crossing his arms, holding his head on one side, and\nscratching the corner of his mouth with his memoranda.\n\nMy Lady removes her eyes from him no more.\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Not like your ladyship's family?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"I think your ladyship,\" says Mr. Guppy, \"can hardly remember Miss\nSummerson's face?\"\n\n\"I remember the young lady very well. What has this to do with me?\"\n\n\"Your ladyship, I do assure you that having Miss Summerson's image\nimprinted on my 'eart--which I mention in confidence--I found, when I\nhad the honour of going over your ladyship's mansion of Chesney Wold\nwhile on a short out in the county of Lincolnshire with a friend,\nsuch a resemblance between Miss Esther Summerson and your ladyship's\nown portrait that it completely knocked me over, so much so that I\ndidn't at the moment even know what it WAS that knocked me over. And\nnow I have the honour of beholding your ladyship near (I have often,\nsince that, taken the liberty of looking at your ladyship in your\ncarriage in the park, when I dare say you was not aware of me, but I\nnever saw your ladyship so near), it's really more surprising than I\nthought it.\"\n\nYoung man of the name of Guppy! There have been times, when ladies\nlived in strongholds and had unscrupulous attendants within call,\nwhen that poor life of yours would NOT have been worth a minute's\npurchase, with those beautiful eyes looking at you as they look at\nthis moment.\n\nMy Lady, slowly using her little hand-screen as a fan, asks him again\nwhat he supposes that his taste for likenesses has to do with her.\n\n\"Your ladyship,\" replies Mr. Guppy, again referring to his paper, \"I\nam coming to that. Dash these notes! Oh! 'Mrs. Chadband.' Yes.\" Mr.\nGuppy draws his chair a little forward and seats himself again. My\nLady reclines in her chair composedly, though with a trifle less of\ngraceful ease than usual perhaps, and never falters in her steady\ngaze. \"A--stop a minute, though!\" Mr. Guppy refers again. \"E.S.\ntwice? Oh, yes! Yes, I see my way now, right on.\"\n\nRolling up the slip of paper as an instrument to point his speech\nwith, Mr. Guppy proceeds.\n\n\"Your ladyship, there is a mystery about Miss Esther Summerson's\nbirth and bringing up. I am informed of that fact because--which I\nmention in confidence--I know it in the way of my profession at Kenge\nand Carboy's. Now, as I have already mentioned to your ladyship, Miss\nSummerson's image is imprinted on my 'eart. If I could clear this\nmystery for her, or prove her to be well related, or find that having\nthe honour to be a remote branch of your ladyship's family she had a\nright to be made a party in Jarndyce and Jarndyce, why, I might make\na sort of a claim upon Miss Summerson to look with an eye of more\ndedicated favour on my proposals than she has exactly done as yet. In\nfact, as yet she hasn't favoured them at all.\"\n\nA kind of angry smile just dawns upon my Lady's face.\n\n\"Now, it's a very singular circumstance, your ladyship,\" says Mr.\nGuppy, \"though one of those circumstances that do fall in the way of\nus professional men--which I may call myself, for though not\nadmitted, yet I have had a present of my articles made to me by Kenge\nand Carboy, on my mother's advancing from the principal of her little\nincome the money for the stamp, which comes heavy--that I have\nencountered the person who lived as servant with the lady who brought\nMiss Summerson up before Mr. Jarndyce took charge of her. That lady\nwas a Miss Barbary, your ladyship.\"\n\nIs the dead colour on my Lady's face reflected from the screen which\nhas a green silk ground and which she holds in her raised hand as if\nshe had forgotten it, or is it a dreadful paleness that has fallen on\nher?\n\n\"Did your ladyship,\" says Mr. Guppy, \"ever happen to hear of Miss\nBarbary?\"\n\n\"I don't know. I think so. Yes.\"\n\n\"Was Miss Barbary at all connected with your ladyship's family?\"\n\nMy Lady's lips move, but they utter nothing. She shakes her head.\n\n\"NOT connected?\" says Mr. Guppy. \"Oh! Not to your ladyship's\nknowledge, perhaps? Ah! But might be? Yes.\" After each of these\ninterrogatories, she has inclined her head. \"Very good! Now, this\nMiss Barbary was extremely close--seems to have been extraordinarily\nclose for a female, females being generally (in common life at least)\nrather given to conversation--and my witness never had an idea\nwhether she possessed a single relative. On one occasion, and only\none, she seems to have been confidential to my witness on a single\npoint, and she then told her that the little girl's real name was not\nEsther Summerson, but Esther Hawdon.\"\n\n\"My God!\"\n\nMr. Guppy stares. Lady Dedlock sits before him looking him through,\nwith the same dark shade upon her face, in the same attitude even to\nthe holding of the screen, with her lips a little apart, her brow a\nlittle contracted, but for the moment dead. He sees her consciousness\nreturn, sees a tremor pass across her frame like a ripple over water,\nsees her lips shake, sees her compose them by a great effort, sees\nher force herself back to the knowledge of his presence and of what\nhe has said. All this, so quickly, that her exclamation and her dead\ncondition seem to have passed away like the features of those\nlong-preserved dead bodies sometimes opened up in tombs, which,\nstruck by the air like lightning, vanish in a breath.\n\n\"Your ladyship is acquainted with the name of Hawdon?\"\n\n\"I have heard it before.\"\n\n\"Name of any collateral or remote branch of your ladyship's family?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Now, your ladyship,\" says Mr. Guppy, \"I come to the last point of\nthe case, so far as I have got it up. It's going on, and I shall\ngather it up closer and closer as it goes on. Your ladyship must\nknow--if your ladyship don't happen, by any chance, to know\nalready--that there was found dead at the house of a person named\nKrook, near Chancery Lane, some time ago, a law-writer in great\ndistress. Upon which law-writer there was an inquest, and which\nlaw-writer was an anonymous character, his name being unknown. But,\nyour ladyship, I have discovered very lately that that law-writer's\nname was Hawdon.\"\n\n\"And what is THAT to me?\"\n\n\"Aye, your ladyship, that's the question! Now, your ladyship, a queer\nthing happened after that man's death. A lady started up, a disguised\nlady, your ladyship, who went to look at the scene of action and went\nto look at his grave. She hired a crossing-sweeping boy to show it\nher. If your ladyship would wish to have the boy produced in\ncorroboration of this statement, I can lay my hand upon him at any\ntime.\"\n\nThe wretched boy is nothing to my Lady, and she does NOT wish to have\nhim produced.\n\n\"Oh, I assure your ladyship it's a very queer start indeed,\" says Mr.\nGuppy. \"If you was to hear him tell about the rings that sparkled on\nher fingers when she took her glove off, you'd think it quite\nromantic.\"\n\nThere are diamonds glittering on the hand that holds the screen. My\nLady trifles with the screen and makes them glitter more, again with\nthat expression which in other times might have been so dangerous to\nthe young man of the name of Guppy.\n\n\"It was supposed, your ladyship, that he left no rag or scrap behind\nhim by which he could be possibly identified. But he did. He left a\nbundle of old letters.\"\n\nThe screen still goes, as before. All this time her eyes never once\nrelease him.\n\n\"They were taken and secreted. And to-morrow night, your ladyship,\nthey will come into my possession.\"\n\n\"Still I ask you, what is this to me?\"\n\n\"Your ladyship, I conclude with that.\" Mr. Guppy rises. \"If you think\nthere's enough in this chain of circumstances put together--in the\nundoubted strong likeness of this young lady to your ladyship, which\nis a positive fact for a jury; in her having been brought up by Miss\nBarbary; in Miss Barbary stating Miss Summerson's real name to be\nHawdon; in your ladyship's knowing both these names VERY WELL; and in\nHawdon's dying as he did--to give your ladyship a family interest in\ngoing further into the case, I will bring these papers here. I don't\nknow what they are, except that they are old letters: I have never\nhad them in my possession yet. I will bring those papers here as soon\nas I get them and go over them for the first time with your ladyship.\nI have told your ladyship my object. I have told your ladyship that I\nshould be placed in a very disagreeable situation if any complaint\nwas made, and all is in strict confidence.\"\n\nIs this the full purpose of the young man of the name of Guppy, or\nhas he any other? Do his words disclose the length, breadth, depth,\nof his object and suspicion in coming here; or if not, what do they\nhide? He is a match for my Lady there. She may look at him, but he\ncan look at the table and keep that witness-box face of his from\ntelling anything.\n\n\"You may bring the letters,\" says my Lady, \"if you choose.\"\n\n\"Your ladyship is not very encouraging, upon my word and honour,\"\nsays Mr. Guppy, a little injured.\n\n\"You may bring the letters,\" she repeats in the same tone, \"if\nyou--please.\"\n\n\"It shall be done. I wish your ladyship good day.\"\n\nOn a table near her is a rich bauble of a casket, barred and clasped\nlike an old strong-chest. She, looking at him still, takes it to her\nand unlocks it.\n\n\"Oh! I assure your ladyship I am not actuated by any motives of that\nsort,\" says Mr. Guppy, \"and I couldn't accept anything of the kind. I\nwish your ladyship good day, and am much obliged to you all the\nsame.\"\n\nSo the young man makes his bow and goes downstairs, where the\nsupercilious Mercury does not consider himself called upon to leave\nhis Olympus by the hall-fire to let the young man out.\n\nAs Sir Leicester basks in his library and dozes over his newspaper,\nis there no influence in the house to startle him, not to say to make\nthe very trees at Chesney Wold fling up their knotted arms, the very\nportraits frown, the very armour stir?\n\nNo. Words, sobs, and cries are but air, and air is so shut in and\nshut out throughout the house in town that sounds need be uttered\ntrumpet-tongued indeed by my Lady in her chamber to carry any faint\nvibration to Sir Leicester's ears; and yet this cry is in the house,\ngoing upward from a wild figure on its knees.\n\n\"O my child, my child! Not dead in the first hours of her life, as my\ncruel sister told me, but sternly nurtured by her, after she had\nrenounced me and my name! O my child, O my child!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXX\n\nEsther's Narrative\n\n\nRichard had been gone away some time when a visitor came to pass a\nfew days with us. It was an elderly lady. It was Mrs. Woodcourt, who,\nhaving come from Wales to stay with Mrs. Bayham Badger and having\nwritten to my guardian, \"by her son Allan's desire,\" to report that\nshe had heard from him and that he was well \"and sent his kind\nremembrances to all of us,\" had been invited by my guardian to make a\nvisit to Bleak House. She stayed with us nearly three weeks. She took\nvery kindly to me and was extremely confidential, so much so that\nsometimes she almost made me uncomfortable. I had no right, I knew\nvery well, to be uncomfortable because she confided in me, and I felt\nit was unreasonable; still, with all I could do, I could not quite\nhelp it.\n\nShe was such a sharp little lady and used to sit with her hands\nfolded in each other looking so very watchful while she talked to me\nthat perhaps I found that rather irksome. Or perhaps it was her being\nso upright and trim, though I don't think it was that, because I\nthought that quaintly pleasant. Nor can it have been the general\nexpression of her face, which was very sparkling and pretty for an\nold lady. I don't know what it was. Or at least if I do now, I\nthought I did not then. Or at least--but it don't matter.\n\nOf a night when I was going upstairs to bed, she would invite me\ninto her room, where she sat before the fire in a great chair;\nand, dear me, she would tell me about Morgan ap-Kerrig until I\nwas quite low-spirited! Sometimes she recited a few verses from\nCrumlinwallinwer and the Mewlinnwillinwodd (if those are the right\nnames, which I dare say they are not), and would become quite fiery\nwith the sentiments they expressed. Though I never knew what they\nwere (being in Welsh), further than that they were highly eulogistic\nof the lineage of Morgan ap-Kerrig.\n\n\"So, Miss Summerson,\" she would say to me with stately triumph,\n\"this, you see, is the fortune inherited by my son. Wherever my son\ngoes, he can claim kindred with Ap-Kerrig. He may not have money, but\nhe always has what is much better--family, my dear.\"\n\nI had my doubts of their caring so very much for Morgan ap-Kerrig in\nIndia and China, but of course I never expressed them. I used to say\nit was a great thing to be so highly connected.\n\n\"It IS, my dear, a great thing,\" Mrs. Woodcourt would reply. \"It has\nits disadvantages; my son's choice of a wife, for instance, is\nlimited by it, but the matrimonial choice of the royal family is\nlimited in much the same manner.\"\n\nThen she would pat me on the arm and smooth my dress, as much as to\nassure me that she had a good opinion of me, the distance between us\nnotwithstanding.\n\n\"Poor Mr. Woodcourt, my dear,\" she would say, and always with some\nemotion, for with her lofty pedigree she had a very affectionate\nheart, \"was descended from a great Highland family, the MacCoorts of\nMacCoort. He served his king and country as an officer in the Royal\nHighlanders, and he died on the field. My son is one of the last\nrepresentatives of two old families. With the blessing of heaven he\nwill set them up again and unite them with another old family.\"\n\nIt was in vain for me to try to change the subject, as I used to try,\nonly for the sake of novelty or perhaps because--but I need not be so\nparticular. Mrs. Woodcourt never would let me change it.\n\n\"My dear,\" she said one night, \"you have so much sense and you look\nat the world in a quiet manner so superior to your time of life that\nit is a comfort to me to talk to you about these family matters of\nmine. You don't know much of my son, my dear; but you know enough of\nhim, I dare say, to recollect him?\"\n\n\"Yes, ma'am. I recollect him.\"\n\n\"Yes, my dear. Now, my dear, I think you are a judge of character,\nand I should like to have your opinion of him.\"\n\n\"Oh, Mrs. Woodcourt,\" said I, \"that is so difficult!\"\n\n\"Why is it so difficult, my dear?\" she returned. \"I don't see it\nmyself.\"\n\n\"To give an opinion--\"\n\n\"On so slight an acquaintance, my dear. THAT'S true.\"\n\nI didn't mean that, because Mr. Woodcourt had been at our house a\ngood deal altogether and had become quite intimate with my guardian.\nI said so, and added that he seemed to be very clever in his\nprofession--we thought--and that his kindness and gentleness to Miss\nFlite were above all praise.\n\n\"You do him justice!\" said Mrs. Woodcourt, pressing my hand. \"You\ndefine him exactly. Allan is a dear fellow, and in his profession\nfaultless. I say it, though I am his mother. Still, I must confess he\nis not without faults, love.\"\n\n\"None of us are,\" said I.\n\n\"Ah! But his really are faults that he might correct, and ought to\ncorrect,\" returned the sharp old lady, sharply shaking her head. \"I\nam so much attached to you that I may confide in you, my dear, as a\nthird party wholly disinterested, that he is fickleness itself.\"\n\nI said I should have thought it hardly possible that he could have\nbeen otherwise than constant to his profession and zealous in the\npursuit of it, judging from the reputation he had earned.\n\n\"You are right again, my dear,\" the old lady retorted, \"but I don't\nrefer to his profession, look you.\"\n\n\"Oh!\" said I.\n\n\"No,\" said she. \"I refer, my dear, to his social conduct. He is\nalways paying trivial attentions to young ladies, and always has\nbeen, ever since he was eighteen. Now, my dear, he has never really\ncared for any one of them and has never meant in doing this to do any\nharm or to express anything but politeness and good nature. Still,\nit's not right, you know; is it?\"\n\n\"No,\" said I, as she seemed to wait for me.\n\n\"And it might lead to mistaken notions, you see, my dear.\"\n\nI supposed it might.\n\n\"Therefore, I have told him many times that he really should be more\ncareful, both in justice to himself and in justice to others. And he\nhas always said, 'Mother, I will be; but you know me better than\nanybody else does, and you know I mean no harm--in short, mean\nnothing.' All of which is very true, my dear, but is no\njustification. However, as he is now gone so far away and for an\nindefinite time, and as he will have good opportunities and\nintroductions, we may consider this past and gone. And you, my dear,\"\nsaid the old lady, who was now all nods and smiles, \"regarding your\ndear self, my love?\"\n\n\"Me, Mrs. Woodcourt?\"\n\n\"Not to be always selfish, talking of my son, who has gone to seek\nhis fortune and to find a wife--when do you mean to seek YOUR fortune\nand to find a husband, Miss Summerson? Hey, look you! Now you blush!\"\n\nI don't think I did blush--at all events, it was not important if I\ndid--and I said my present fortune perfectly contented me and I had\nno wish to change it.\n\n\"Shall I tell you what I always think of you and the fortune yet to\ncome for you, my love?\" said Mrs. Woodcourt.\n\n\"If you believe you are a good prophet,\" said I.\n\n\"Why, then, it is that you will marry some one very rich and very\nworthy, much older--five and twenty years, perhaps--than yourself.\nAnd you will be an excellent wife, and much beloved, and very happy.\"\n\n\"That is a good fortune,\" said I. \"But why is it to be mine?\"\n\n\"My dear,\" she returned, \"there's suitability in it--you are so busy,\nand so neat, and so peculiarly situated altogether that there's\nsuitability in it, and it will come to pass. And nobody, my love,\nwill congratulate you more sincerely on such a marriage than I\nshall.\"\n\nIt was curious that this should make me uncomfortable, but I think it\ndid. I know it did. It made me for some part of that night\nuncomfortable. I was so ashamed of my folly that I did not like to\nconfess it even to Ada, and that made me more uncomfortable still. I\nwould have given anything not to have been so much in the bright old\nlady's confidence if I could have possibly declined it. It gave me\nthe most inconsistent opinions of her. At one time I thought she was\na story-teller, and at another time that she was the pink of truth.\nNow I suspected that she was very cunning, next moment I believed her\nhonest Welsh heart to be perfectly innocent and simple. And after\nall, what did it matter to me, and why did it matter to me? Why could\nnot I, going up to bed with my basket of keys, stop to sit down by\nher fire and accommodate myself for a little while to her, at least\nas well as to anybody else, and not trouble myself about the harmless\nthings she said to me? Impelled towards her, as I certainly was, for\nI was very anxious that she should like me and was very glad indeed\nthat she did, why should I harp afterwards, with actual distress and\npain, on every word she said and weigh it over and over again in\ntwenty scales? Why was it so worrying to me to have her in our house,\nand confidential to me every night, when I yet felt that it was\nbetter and safer somehow that she should be there than anywhere else?\nThese were perplexities and contradictions that I could not account\nfor. At least, if I could--but I shall come to all that by and by,\nand it is mere idleness to go on about it now.\n\nSo when Mrs. Woodcourt went away, I was sorry to lose her but was\nrelieved too. And then Caddy Jellyby came down, and Caddy brought\nsuch a packet of domestic news that it gave us abundant occupation.\n\nFirst Caddy declared (and would at first declare nothing else) that I\nwas the best adviser that ever was known. This, my pet said, was no\nnews at all; and this, I said, of course, was nonsense. Then Caddy\ntold us that she was going to be married in a month and that if Ada\nand I would be her bridesmaids, she was the happiest girl in the\nworld. To be sure, this was news indeed; and I thought we never\nshould have done talking about it, we had so much to say to Caddy,\nand Caddy had so much to say to us.\n\nIt seemed that Caddy's unfortunate papa had got over his\nbankruptcy--\"gone through the Gazette,\" was the expression Caddy\nused, as if it were a tunnel--with the general clemency and\ncommiseration of his creditors, and had got rid of his affairs in\nsome blessed manner without succeeding in understanding them, and had\ngiven up everything he possessed (which was not worth much, I should\nthink, to judge from the state of the furniture), and had satisfied\nevery one concerned that he could do no more, poor man. So, he had\nbeen honourably dismissed to \"the office\" to begin the world again.\nWhat he did at the office, I never knew; Caddy said he was a\n\"custom-house and general agent,\" and the only thing I ever\nunderstood about that business was that when he wanted money more\nthan usual he went to the docks to look for it, and hardly ever found\nit.\n\nAs soon as her papa had tranquillized his mind by becoming this shorn\nlamb, and they had removed to a furnished lodging in Hatton Garden\n(where I found the children, when I afterwards went there, cutting\nthe horse hair out of the seats of the chairs and choking themselves\nwith it), Caddy had brought about a meeting between him and old Mr.\nTurveydrop; and poor Mr. Jellyby, being very humble and meek, had\ndeferred to Mr. Turveydrop's deportment so submissively that they had\nbecome excellent friends. By degrees, old Mr. Turveydrop, thus\nfamiliarized with the idea of his son's marriage, had worked up his\nparental feelings to the height of contemplating that event as being\nnear at hand and had given his gracious consent to the young couple\ncommencing housekeeping at the academy in Newman Street when they\nwould.\n\n\"And your papa, Caddy. What did he say?\"\n\n\"Oh! Poor Pa,\" said Caddy, \"only cried and said he hoped we might get\non better than he and Ma had got on. He didn't say so before Prince,\nhe only said so to me. And he said, 'My poor girl, you have not been\nvery well taught how to make a home for your husband, but unless you\nmean with all your heart to strive to do it, you had better murder\nhim than marry him--if you really love him.'\"\n\n\"And how did you reassure him, Caddy?\"\n\n\"Why, it was very distressing, you know, to see poor Pa so low and\nhear him say such terrible things, and I couldn't help crying myself.\nBut I told him that I DID mean it with all my heart and that I hoped\nour house would be a place for him to come and find some comfort in\nof an evening and that I hoped and thought I could be a better\ndaughter to him there than at home. Then I mentioned Peepy's coming\nto stay with me, and then Pa began to cry again and said the children\nwere Indians.\"\n\n\"Indians, Caddy?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Caddy, \"wild Indians. And Pa said\"--here she began to\nsob, poor girl, not at all like the happiest girl in the world--\"that\nhe was sensible the best thing that could happen to them was their\nbeing all tomahawked together.\"\n\nAda suggested that it was comfortable to know that Mr. Jellyby did\nnot mean these destructive sentiments.\n\n\"No, of course I know Pa wouldn't like his family to be weltering in\ntheir blood,\" said Caddy, \"but he means that they are very\nunfortunate in being Ma's children and that he is very unfortunate in\nbeing Ma's husband; and I am sure that's true, though it seems\nunnatural to say so.\"\n\nI asked Caddy if Mrs. Jellyby knew that her wedding-day was fixed.\n\n\"Oh! You know what Ma is, Esther,\" she returned. \"It's impossible to\nsay whether she knows it or not. She has been told it often enough;\nand when she IS told it, she only gives me a placid look, as if I was\nI don't know what--a steeple in the distance,\" said Caddy with a\nsudden idea; \"and then she shakes her head and says 'Oh, Caddy,\nCaddy, what a tease you are!' and goes on with the Borrioboola\nletters.\"\n\n\"And about your wardrobe, Caddy?\" said I. For she was under no\nrestraint with us.\n\n\"Well, my dear Esther,\" she returned, drying her eyes, \"I must do the\nbest I can and trust to my dear Prince never to have an unkind\nremembrance of my coming so shabbily to him. If the question\nconcerned an outfit for Borrioboola, Ma would know all about it and\nwould be quite excited. Being what it is, she neither knows nor\ncares.\"\n\nCaddy was not at all deficient in natural affection for her mother,\nbut mentioned this with tears as an undeniable fact, which I am\nafraid it was. We were sorry for the poor dear girl and found so much\nto admire in the good disposition which had survived under such\ndiscouragement that we both at once (I mean Ada and I) proposed a\nlittle scheme that made her perfectly joyful. This was her staying\nwith us for three weeks, my staying with her for one, and our all\nthree contriving and cutting out, and repairing, and sewing, and\nsaving, and doing the very best we could think of to make the most of\nher stock. My guardian being as pleased with the idea as Caddy was,\nwe took her home next day to arrange the matter and brought her out\nagain in triumph with her boxes and all the purchases that could be\nsqueezed out of a ten-pound note, which Mr. Jellyby had found in the\ndocks I suppose, but which he at all events gave her. What my\nguardian would not have given her if we had encouraged him, it would\nbe difficult to say, but we thought it right to compound for no more\nthan her wedding-dress and bonnet. He agreed to this compromise, and\nif Caddy had ever been happy in her life, she was happy when we sat\ndown to work.\n\nShe was clumsy enough with her needle, poor girl, and pricked her\nfingers as much as she had been used to ink them. She could not help\nreddening a little now and then, partly with the smart and partly\nwith vexation at being able to do no better, but she soon got over\nthat and began to improve rapidly. So day after day she, and my\ndarling, and my little maid Charley, and a milliner out of the town,\nand I, sat hard at work, as pleasantly as possible.\n\nOver and above this, Caddy was very anxious \"to learn housekeeping,\"\nas she said. Now, mercy upon us! The idea of her learning\nhousekeeping of a person of my vast experience was such a joke that I\nlaughed, and coloured up, and fell into a comical confusion when she\nproposed it. However, I said, \"Caddy, I am sure you are very welcome\nto learn anything that you can learn of ME, my dear,\" and I showed\nher all my books and methods and all my fidgety ways. You would have\nsupposed that I was showing her some wonderful inventions, by her\nstudy of them; and if you had seen her, whenever I jingled my\nhousekeeping keys, get up and attend me, certainly you might have\nthought that there never was a greater imposter than I with a blinder\nfollower than Caddy Jellyby.\n\nSo what with working and housekeeping, and lessons to Charley, and\nbackgammon in the evening with my guardian, and duets with Ada, the\nthree weeks slipped fast away. Then I went home with Caddy to see\nwhat could be done there, and Ada and Charley remained behind to take\ncare of my guardian.\n\nWhen I say I went home with Caddy, I mean to the furnished lodging in\nHatton Garden. We went to Newman Street two or three times, where\npreparations were in progress too--a good many, I observed, for\nenhancing the comforts of old Mr. Turveydrop, and a few for putting\nthe newly married couple away cheaply at the top of the house--but\nour great point was to make the furnished lodging decent for the\nwedding-breakfast and to imbue Mrs. Jellyby beforehand with some\nfaint sense of the occasion.\n\nThe latter was the more difficult thing of the two because Mrs.\nJellyby and an unwholesome boy occupied the front sitting-room (the\nback one was a mere closet), and it was littered down with\nwaste-paper and Borrioboolan documents, as an untidy stable might be\nlittered with straw. Mrs. Jellyby sat there all day drinking strong\ncoffee, dictating, and holding Borrioboolan interviews by\nappointment. The unwholesome boy, who seemed to me to be going into a\ndecline, took his meals out of the house. When Mr. Jellyby came home,\nhe usually groaned and went down into the kitchen. There he got\nsomething to eat if the servant would give him anything, and then,\nfeeling that he was in the way, went out and walked about Hatton\nGarden in the wet. The poor children scrambled up and tumbled down\nthe house as they had always been accustomed to do.\n\nThe production of these devoted little sacrifices in any presentable\ncondition being quite out of the question at a week's notice, I\nproposed to Caddy that we should make them as happy as we could on\nher marriage morning in the attic where they all slept, and should\nconfine our greatest efforts to her mama and her mama's room, and a\nclean breakfast. In truth Mrs. Jellyby required a good deal of\nattention, the lattice-work up her back having widened considerably\nsince I first knew her and her hair looking like the mane of a\ndustman's horse.\n\nThinking that the display of Caddy's wardrobe would be the best means\nof approaching the subject, I invited Mrs. Jellyby to come and look\nat it spread out on Caddy's bed in the evening after the unwholesome\nboy was gone.\n\n\"My dear Miss Summerson,\" said she, rising from her desk with her\nusual sweetness of temper, \"these are really ridiculous preparations,\nthough your assisting them is a proof of your kindness. There is\nsomething so inexpressibly absurd to me in the idea of Caddy being\nmarried! Oh, Caddy, you silly, silly, silly puss!\"\n\nShe came upstairs with us notwithstanding and looked at the clothes\nin her customary far-off manner. They suggested one distinct idea to\nher, for she said with her placid smile, and shaking her head, \"My\ngood Miss Summerson, at half the cost, this weak child might have\nbeen equipped for Africa!\"\n\nOn our going downstairs again, Mrs. Jellyby asked me whether this\ntroublesome business was really to take place next Wednesday. And on\nmy replying yes, she said, \"Will my room be required, my dear Miss\nSummerson? For it's quite impossible that I can put my papers away.\"\n\nI took the liberty of saying that the room would certainly be wanted\nand that I thought we must put the papers away somewhere. \"Well, my\ndear Miss Summerson,\" said Mrs. Jellyby, \"you know best, I dare say.\nBut by obliging me to employ a boy, Caddy has embarrassed me to that\nextent, overwhelmed as I am with public business, that I don't know\nwhich way to turn. We have a Ramification meeting, too, on Wednesday\nafternoon, and the inconvenience is very serious.\"\n\n\"It is not likely to occur again,\" said I, smiling. \"Caddy will be\nmarried but once, probably.\"\n\n\"That's true,\" Mrs. Jellyby replied; \"that's true, my dear. I suppose\nwe must make the best of it!\"\n\nThe next question was how Mrs. Jellyby should be dressed on the\noccasion. I thought it very curious to see her looking on serenely\nfrom her writing-table while Caddy and I discussed it, occasionally\nshaking her head at us with a half-reproachful smile like a superior\nspirit who could just bear with our trifling.\n\nThe state in which her dresses were, and the extraordinary confusion\nin which she kept them, added not a little to our difficulty; but at\nlength we devised something not very unlike what a common-place\nmother might wear on such an occasion. The abstracted manner in which\nMrs. Jellyby would deliver herself up to having this attire tried on\nby the dressmaker, and the sweetness with which she would then\nobserve to me how sorry she was that I had not turned my thoughts to\nAfrica, were consistent with the rest of her behaviour.\n\nThe lodging was rather confined as to space, but I fancied that if\nMrs. Jellyby's household had been the only lodgers in Saint Paul's or\nSaint Peter's, the sole advantage they would have found in the size\nof the building would have been its affording a great deal of room to\nbe dirty in. I believe that nothing belonging to the family which it\nhad been possible to break was unbroken at the time of those\npreparations for Caddy's marriage, that nothing which it had been\npossible to spoil in any way was unspoilt, and that no domestic\nobject which was capable of collecting dirt, from a dear child's knee\nto the door-plate, was without as much dirt as could well accumulate\nupon it.\n\nPoor Mr. Jellyby, who very seldom spoke and almost always sat when he\nwas at home with his head against the wall, became interested when he\nsaw that Caddy and I were attempting to establish some order among\nall this waste and ruin and took off his coat to help. But such\nwonderful things came tumbling out of the closets when they were\nopened--bits of mouldy pie, sour bottles, Mrs. Jellyby's caps,\nletters, tea, forks, odd boots and shoes of children, firewood,\nwafers, saucepan-lids, damp sugar in odds and ends of paper bags,\nfootstools, blacklead brushes, bread, Mrs. Jellyby's bonnets, books\nwith butter sticking to the binding, guttered candle ends put out\nby being turned upside down in broken candlesticks, nutshells,\nheads and tails of shrimps, dinner-mats, gloves, coffee-grounds,\numbrellas--that he looked frightened, and left off again. But he came\nregularly every evening and sat without his coat, with his head\nagainst the wall, as though he would have helped us if he had known\nhow.\n\n\"Poor Pa!\" said Caddy to me on the night before the great day, when\nwe really had got things a little to rights. \"It seems unkind to\nleave him, Esther. But what could I do if I stayed! Since I first\nknew you, I have tidied and tidied over and over again, but it's\nuseless. Ma and Africa, together, upset the whole house directly. We\nnever have a servant who don't drink. Ma's ruinous to everything.\"\n\nMr. Jellyby could not hear what she said, but he seemed very low\nindeed and shed tears, I thought.\n\n\"My heart aches for him; that it does!\" sobbed Caddy. \"I can't help\nthinking to-night, Esther, how dearly I hope to be happy with Prince,\nand how dearly Pa hoped, I dare say, to be happy with Ma. What a\ndisappointed life!\"\n\n\"My dear Caddy!\" said Mr. Jellyby, looking slowly round from the\nwail. It was the first time, I think, I ever heard him say three\nwords together.\n\n\"Yes, Pa!\" cried Caddy, going to him and embracing him\naffectionately.\n\n\"My dear Caddy,\" said Mr. Jellyby. \"Never have--\"\n\n\"Not Prince, Pa?\" faltered Caddy. \"Not have Prince?\"\n\n\"Yes, my dear,\" said Mr. Jellyby. \"Have him, certainly. But, never\nhave--\"\n\nI mentioned in my account of our first visit in Thavies Inn that\nRichard described Mr. Jellyby as frequently opening his mouth after\ndinner without saying anything. It was a habit of his. He opened his\nmouth now a great many times and shook his head in a melancholy\nmanner.\n\n\"What do you wish me not to have? Don't have what, dear Pa?\" asked\nCaddy, coaxing him, with her arms round his neck.\n\n\"Never have a mission, my dear child.\"\n\nMr. Jellyby groaned and laid his head against the wall again, and\nthis was the only time I ever heard him make any approach to\nexpressing his sentiments on the Borrioboolan question. I suppose he\nhad been more talkative and lively once, but he seemed to have been\ncompletely exhausted long before I knew him.\n\nI thought Mrs. Jellyby never would have left off serenely looking\nover her papers and drinking coffee that night. It was twelve o'clock\nbefore we could obtain possession of the room, and the clearance it\nrequired then was so discouraging that Caddy, who was almost tired\nout, sat down in the middle of the dust and cried. But she soon\ncheered up, and we did wonders with it before we went to bed.\n\nIn the morning it looked, by the aid of a few flowers and a quantity\nof soap and water and a little arrangement, quite gay. The plain\nbreakfast made a cheerful show, and Caddy was perfectly charming. But\nwhen my darling came, I thought--and I think now--that I never had\nseen such a dear face as my beautiful pet's.\n\nWe made a little feast for the children upstairs, and we put Peepy at\nthe head of the table, and we showed them Caddy in her bridal dress,\nand they clapped their hands and hurrahed, and Caddy cried to think\nthat she was going away from them and hugged them over and over again\nuntil we brought Prince up to fetch her away--when, I am sorry to\nsay, Peepy bit him. Then there was old Mr. Turveydrop downstairs, in\na state of deportment not to be expressed, benignly blessing Caddy\nand giving my guardian to understand that his son's happiness was his\nown parental work and that he sacrificed personal considerations to\nensure it. \"My dear sir,\" said Mr. Turveydrop, \"these young people\nwill live with me; my house is large enough for their accommodation,\nand they shall not want the shelter of my roof. I could have\nwished--you will understand the allusion, Mr. Jarndyce, for you\nremember my illustrious patron the Prince Regent--I could have\nwished that my son had married into a family where there was more\ndeportment, but the will of heaven be done!\"\n\nMr. and Mrs. Pardiggle were of the party--Mr. Pardiggle, an\nobstinate-looking man with a large waistcoat and stubbly hair, who\nwas always talking in a loud bass voice about his mite, or Mrs.\nPardiggle's mite, or their five boys' mites. Mr. Quale, with his hair\nbrushed back as usual and his knobs of temples shining very much, was\nalso there, not in the character of a disappointed lover, but as the\naccepted of a young--at least, an unmarried--lady, a Miss Wisk, who\nwas also there. Miss Wisk's mission, my guardian said, was to show\nthe world that woman's mission was man's mission and that the only\ngenuine mission of both man and woman was to be always moving\ndeclaratory resolutions about things in general at public meetings.\nThe guests were few, but were, as one might expect at Mrs. Jellyby's,\nall devoted to public objects only. Besides those I have mentioned,\nthere was an extremely dirty lady with her bonnet all awry and the\nticketed price of her dress still sticking on it, whose neglected\nhome, Caddy told me, was like a filthy wilderness, but whose church\nwas like a fancy fair. A very contentious gentleman, who said it was\nhis mission to be everybody's brother but who appeared to be on terms\nof coolness with the whole of his large family, completed the party.\n\nA party, having less in common with such an occasion, could hardly\nhave been got together by any ingenuity. Such a mean mission as the\ndomestic mission was the very last thing to be endured among them;\nindeed, Miss Wisk informed us, with great indignation, before we sat\ndown to breakfast, that the idea of woman's mission lying chiefly in\nthe narrow sphere of home was an outrageous slander on the part of\nher tyrant, man. One other singularity was that nobody with a\nmission--except Mr. Quale, whose mission, as I think I have formerly\nsaid, was to be in ecstasies with everybody's mission--cared at all\nfor anybody's mission. Mrs. Pardiggle being as clear that the only\none infallible course was her course of pouncing upon the poor and\napplying benevolence to them like a strait-waistcoat; as Miss Wisk\nwas that the only practical thing for the world was the emancipation\nof woman from the thraldom of her tyrant, man. Mrs. Jellyby, all the\nwhile, sat smiling at the limited vision that could see anything but\nBorrioboola-Gha.\n\nBut I am anticipating now the purport of our conversation on the ride\nhome instead of first marrying Caddy. We all went to church, and Mr.\nJellyby gave her away. Of the air with which old Mr. Turveydrop, with\nhis hat under his left arm (the inside presented at the clergyman\nlike a cannon) and his eyes creasing themselves up into his wig,\nstood stiff and high-shouldered behind us bridesmaids during the\nceremony, and afterwards saluted us, I could never say enough to do\nit justice. Miss Wisk, whom I cannot report as prepossessing in\nappearance, and whose manner was grim, listened to the proceedings,\nas part of woman's wrongs, with a disdainful face. Mrs. Jellyby, with\nher calm smile and her bright eyes, looked the least concerned of all\nthe company.\n\nWe duly came back to breakfast, and Mrs. Jellyby sat at the head of\nthe table and Mr. Jellyby at the foot. Caddy had previously stolen\nupstairs to hug the children again and tell them that her name was\nTurveydrop. But this piece of information, instead of being an\nagreeable surprise to Peepy, threw him on his back in such transports\nof kicking grief that I could do nothing on being sent for but accede\nto the proposal that he should be admitted to the breakfast table. So\nhe came down and sat in my lap; and Mrs. Jellyby, after saying, in\nreference to the state of his pinafore, \"Oh, you naughty Peepy, what\na shocking little pig you are!\" was not at all discomposed. He was\nvery good except that he brought down Noah with him (out of an ark I\nhad given him before we went to church) and WOULD dip him head first\ninto the wine-glasses and then put him in his mouth.\n\nMy guardian, with his sweet temper and his quick perception and his\namiable face, made something agreeable even out of the ungenial\ncompany. None of them seemed able to talk about anything but his, or\nher, own one subject, and none of them seemed able to talk about even\nthat as part of a world in which there was anything else; but my\nguardian turned it all to the merry encouragement of Caddy and the\nhonour of the occasion, and brought us through the breakfast nobly.\nWhat we should have done without him, I am afraid to think, for all\nthe company despising the bride and bridegroom and old Mr.\nTurveydrop--and old Mr. Thurveydrop, in virtue of his deportment,\nconsidering himself vastly superior to all the company--it was a very\nunpromising case.\n\nAt last the time came when poor Caddy was to go and when all her\nproperty was packed on the hired coach and pair that was to take her\nand her husband to Gravesend. It affected us to see Caddy clinging,\nthen, to her deplorable home and hanging on her mother's neck with\nthe greatest tenderness.\n\n\"I am very sorry I couldn't go on writing from dictation, Ma,\" sobbed\nCaddy. \"I hope you forgive me now.\"\n\n\"Oh, Caddy, Caddy!\" said Mrs. Jellyby. \"I have told you over and over\nagain that I have engaged a boy, and there's an end of it.\"\n\n\"You are sure you are not the least angry with me, Ma? Say you are\nsure before I go away, Ma?\"\n\n\"You foolish Caddy,\" returned Mrs. Jellyby, \"do I look angry, or have\nI inclination to be angry, or time to be angry? How CAN you?\"\n\n\"Take a little care of Pa while I am gone, Mama!\"\n\nMrs. Jellyby positively laughed at the fancy. \"You romantic child,\"\nsaid she, lightly patting Caddy's back. \"Go along. I am excellent\nfriends with you. Now, good-bye, Caddy, and be very happy!\"\n\nThen Caddy hung upon her father and nursed his cheek against hers as\nif he were some poor dull child in pain. All this took place in the\nhall. Her father released her, took out his pocket handkerchief, and\nsat down on the stairs with his head against the wall. I hope he\nfound some consolation in walls. I almost think he did.\n\nAnd then Prince took her arm in his and turned with great emotion and\nrespect to his father, whose deportment at that moment was\noverwhelming.\n\n\"Thank you over and over again, father!\" said Prince, kissing his\nhand. \"I am very grateful for all your kindness and consideration\nregarding our marriage, and so, I can assure you, is Caddy.\"\n\n\"Very,\" sobbed Caddy. \"Ve-ry!\"\n\n\"My dear son,\" said Mr. Turveydrop, \"and dear daughter, I have done\nmy duty. If the spirit of a sainted wooman hovers above us and looks\ndown on the occasion, that, and your constant affection, will be my\nrecompense. You will not fail in YOUR duty, my son and daughter, I\nbelieve?\"\n\n\"Dear father, never!\" cried Prince.\n\n\"Never, never, dear Mr. Turveydrop!\" said Caddy.\n\n\"This,\" returned Mr. Turveydrop, \"is as it should be. My children, my\nhome is yours, my heart is yours, my all is yours. I will never leave\nyou; nothing but death shall part us. My dear son, you contemplate an\nabsence of a week, I think?\"\n\n\"A week, dear father. We shall return home this day week.\"\n\n\"My dear child,\" said Mr. Turveydrop, \"let me, even under the present\nexceptional circumstances, recommend strict punctuality. It is highly\nimportant to keep the connexion together; and schools, if at all\nneglected, are apt to take offence.\"\n\n\"This day week, father, we shall be sure to be home to dinner.\"\n\n\"Good!\" said Mr. Turveydrop. \"You will find fires, my dear Caroline,\nin your own room, and dinner prepared in my apartment. Yes, yes,\nPrince!\" anticipating some self-denying objection on his son's part\nwith a great air. \"You and our Caroline will be strange in the upper\npart of the premises and will, therefore, dine that day in my\napartment. Now, bless ye!\"\n\nThey drove away, and whether I wondered most at Mrs. Jellyby or at\nMr. Turveydrop, I did not know. Ada and my guardian were in the same\ncondition when we came to talk it over. But before we drove away too,\nI received a most unexpected and eloquent compliment from Mr.\nJellyby. He came up to me in the hall, took both my hands, pressed\nthem earnestly, and opened his mouth twice. I was so sure of his\nmeaning that I said, quite flurried, \"You are very welcome, sir. Pray\ndon't mention it!\"\n\n\"I hope this marriage is for the best, guardian,\" said I when we\nthree were on our road home.\n\n\"I hope it is, little woman. Patience. We shall see.\"\n\n\"Is the wind in the east to-day?\" I ventured to ask him.\n\nHe laughed heartily and answered, \"No.\"\n\n\"But it must have been this morning, I think,\" said I.\n\nHe answered \"No\" again, and this time my dear girl confidently\nanswered \"No\" too and shook the lovely head which, with its blooming\nflowers against the golden hair, was like the very spring. \"Much YOU\nknow of east winds, my ugly darling,\" said I, kissing her in my\nadmiration--I couldn't help it.\n\nWell! It was only their love for me, I know very well, and it is a\nlong time ago. I must write it even if I rub it out again, because it\ngives me so much pleasure. They said there could be no east wind\nwhere Somebody was; they said that wherever Dame Durden went, there\nwas sunshine and summer air.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXI\n\nNurse and Patient\n\n\nI had not been at home again many days when one evening I went\nupstairs into my own room to take a peep over Charley's shoulder and\nsee how she was getting on with her copy-book. Writing was a trying\nbusiness to Charley, who seemed to have no natural power over a pen,\nbut in whose hand every pen appeared to become perversely animated,\nand to go wrong and crooked, and to stop, and splash, and sidle into\ncorners like a saddle-donkey. It was very odd to see what old letters\nCharley's young hand had made, they so wrinkled, and shrivelled, and\ntottering, it so plump and round. Yet Charley was uncommonly expert\nat other things and had as nimble little fingers as I ever watched.\n\n\"Well, Charley,\" said I, looking over a copy of the letter O in which\nit was represented as square, triangular, pear-shaped, and collapsed\nin all kinds of ways, \"we are improving. If we only get to make it\nround, we shall be perfect, Charley.\"\n\nThen I made one, and Charley made one, and the pen wouldn't join\nCharley's neatly, but twisted it up into a knot.\n\n\"Never mind, Charley. We shall do it in time.\"\n\nCharley laid down her pen, the copy being finished, opened and shut\nher cramped little hand, looked gravely at the page, half in pride\nand half in doubt, and got up, and dropped me a curtsy.\n\n\"Thank you, miss. If you please, miss, did you know a poor person of\nthe name of Jenny?\"\n\n\"A brickmaker's wife, Charley? Yes.\"\n\n\"She came and spoke to me when I was out a little while ago, and said\nyou knew her, miss. She asked me if I wasn't the young lady's little\nmaid--meaning you for the young lady, miss--and I said yes, miss.\"\n\n\"I thought she had left this neighbourhood altogether, Charley.\"\n\n\"So she had, miss, but she's come back again to where she used to\nlive--she and Liz. Did you know another poor person of the name of\nLiz, miss?\"\n\n\"I think I do, Charley, though not by name.\"\n\n\"That's what she said!\" returned Charley. \"They have both come back,\nmiss, and have been tramping high and low.\"\n\n\"Tramping high and low, have they, Charley?\"\n\n\"Yes, miss.\" If Charley could only have made the letters in her copy\nas round as the eyes with which she looked into my face, they would\nhave been excellent. \"And this poor person came about the house three\nor four days, hoping to get a glimpse of you, miss--all she wanted,\nshe said--but you were away. That was when she saw me. She saw me\na-going about, miss,\" said Charley with a short laugh of the greatest\ndelight and pride, \"and she thought I looked like your maid!\"\n\n\"Did she though, really, Charley?\"\n\n\"Yes, miss!\" said Charley. \"Really and truly.\" And Charley, with\nanother short laugh of the purest glee, made her eyes very round\nagain and looked as serious as became my maid. I was never tired of\nseeing Charley in the full enjoyment of that great dignity, standing\nbefore me with her youthful face and figure, and her steady manner,\nand her childish exultation breaking through it now and then in the\npleasantest way.\n\n\"And where did you see her, Charley?\" said I.\n\nMy little maid's countenance fell as she replied, \"By the doctor's\nshop, miss.\" For Charley wore her black frock yet.\n\nI asked if the brickmaker's wife were ill, but Charley said no. It\nwas some one else. Some one in her cottage who had tramped down to\nSaint Albans and was tramping he didn't know where. A poor boy,\nCharley said. No father, no mother, no any one. \"Like as Tom might\nhave been, miss, if Emma and me had died after father,\" said Charley,\nher round eyes filling with tears.\n\n\"And she was getting medicine for him, Charley?\"\n\n\"She said, miss,\" returned Charley, \"how that he had once done as\nmuch for her.\"\n\nMy little maid's face was so eager and her quiet hands were folded so\nclosely in one another as she stood looking at me that I had no great\ndifficulty in reading her thoughts. \"Well, Charley,\" said I, \"it\nappears to me that you and I can do no better than go round to\nJenny's and see what's the matter.\"\n\nThe alacrity with which Charley brought my bonnet and veil, and\nhaving dressed me, quaintly pinned herself into her warm shawl and\nmade herself look like a little old woman, sufficiently expressed her\nreadiness. So Charley and I, without saying anything to any one, went\nout.\n\nIt was a cold, wild night, and the trees shuddered in the wind. The\nrain had been thick and heavy all day, and with little intermission\nfor many days. None was falling just then, however. The sky had\npartly cleared, but was very gloomy--even above us, where a few stars\nwere shining. In the north and north-west, where the sun had set\nthree hours before, there was a pale dead light both beautiful and\nawful; and into it long sullen lines of cloud waved up like a sea\nstricken immovable as it was heaving. Towards London a lurid glare\noverhung the whole dark waste, and the contrast between these two\nlights, and the fancy which the redder light engendered of an\nunearthly fire, gleaming on all the unseen buildings of the city and\non all the faces of its many thousands of wondering inhabitants, was\nas solemn as might be.\n\nI had no thought that night--none, I am quite sure--of what was soon\nto happen to me. But I have always remembered since that when we had\nstopped at the garden-gate to look up at the sky, and when we went\nupon our way, I had for a moment an undefinable impression of myself\nas being something different from what I then was. I know it was then\nand there that I had it. I have ever since connected the feeling with\nthat spot and time and with everything associated with that spot and\ntime, to the distant voices in the town, the barking of a dog, and\nthe sound of wheels coming down the miry hill.\n\nIt was Saturday night, and most of the people belonging to the place\nwhere we were going were drinking elsewhere. We found it quieter than\nI had previously seen it, though quite as miserable. The kilns were\nburning, and a stifling vapour set towards us with a pale-blue glare.\n\nWe came to the cottage, where there was a feeble candle in the\npatched window. We tapped at the door and went in. The mother of the\nlittle child who had died was sitting in a chair on one side of the\npoor fire by the bed; and opposite to her, a wretched boy, supported\nby the chimney-piece, was cowering on the floor. He held under his\narm, like a little bundle, a fragment of a fur cap; and as he tried\nto warm himself, he shook until the crazy door and window shook. The\nplace was closer than before and had an unhealthy and a very peculiar\nsmell.\n\nI had not lifted my veil when I first spoke to the woman, which was\nat the moment of our going in. The boy staggered up instantly and\nstared at me with a remarkable expression of surprise and terror.\n\nHis action was so quick and my being the cause of it was so evident\nthat I stood still instead of advancing nearer.\n\n\"I won't go no more to the berryin ground,\" muttered the boy; \"I\nain't a-going there, so I tell you!\"\n\nI lifted my veil and spoke to the woman. She said to me in a low\nvoice, \"Don't mind him, ma'am. He'll soon come back to his head,\" and\nsaid to him, \"Jo, Jo, what's the matter?\"\n\n\"I know wot she's come for!\" cried the boy.\n\n\"Who?\"\n\n\"The lady there. She's come to get me to go along with her to the\nberryin ground. I won't go to the berryin ground. I don't like the\nname on it. She might go a-berryin ME.\" His shivering came on again,\nand as he leaned against the wall, he shook the hovel.\n\n\"He has been talking off and on about such like all day, ma'am,\" said\nJenny softly. \"Why, how you stare! This is MY lady, Jo.\"\n\n\"Is it?\" returned the boy doubtfully, and surveying me with his arm\nheld out above his burning eyes. \"She looks to me the t'other one. It\nain't the bonnet, nor yet it ain't the gownd, but she looks to me the\nt'other one.\"\n\nMy little Charley, with her premature experience of illness and\ntrouble, had pulled off her bonnet and shawl and now went quietly up\nto him with a chair and sat him down in it like an old sick nurse.\nExcept that no such attendant could have shown him Charley's youthful\nface, which seemed to engage his confidence.\n\n\"I say!\" said the boy. \"YOU tell me. Ain't the lady the t'other\nlady?\"\n\nCharley shook her head as she methodically drew his rags about him\nand made him as warm as she could.\n\n\"Oh!\" the boy muttered. \"Then I s'pose she ain't.\"\n\n\"I came to see if I could do you any good,\" said I. \"What is the\nmatter with you?\"\n\n\"I'm a-being froze,\" returned the boy hoarsely, with his haggard gaze\nwandering about me, \"and then burnt up, and then froze, and then\nburnt up, ever so many times in a hour. And my head's all sleepy, and\nall a-going mad-like--and I'm so dry--and my bones isn't half so much\nbones as pain.\n\n\"When did he come here?\" I asked the woman.\n\n\"This morning, ma'am, I found him at the corner of the town. I had\nknown him up in London yonder. Hadn't I, Jo?\"\n\n\"Tom-all-Alone's,\" the boy replied.\n\nWhenever he fixed his attention or his eyes, it was only for a very\nlittle while. He soon began to droop his head again, and roll it\nheavily, and speak as if he were half awake.\n\n\"When did he come from London?\" I asked.\n\n\"I come from London yes'day,\" said the boy himself, now flushed and\nhot. \"I'm a-going somewheres.\"\n\n\"Where is he going?\" I asked.\n\n\"Somewheres,\" repeated the boy in a louder tone. \"I have been moved\non, and moved on, more nor ever I was afore, since the t'other one\ngive me the sov'ring. Mrs. Snagsby, she's always a-watching, and\na-driving of me--what have I done to her?--and they're all a-watching\nand a-driving of me. Every one of 'em's doing of it, from the time\nwhen I don't get up, to the time when I don't go to bed. And I'm\na-going somewheres. That's where I'm a-going. She told me, down in\nTom-all-Alone's, as she came from Stolbuns, and so I took the\nStolbuns Road. It's as good as another.\"\n\nHe always concluded by addressing Charley.\n\n\"What is to be done with him?\" said I, taking the woman aside. \"He\ncould not travel in this state even if he had a purpose and knew\nwhere he was going!\"\n\n\"I know no more, ma'am, than the dead,\" she replied, glancing\ncompassionately at him. \"Perhaps the dead know better, if they could\nonly tell us. I've kept him here all day for pity's sake, and I've\ngiven him broth and physic, and Liz has gone to try if any one will\ntake him in (here's my pretty in the bed--her child, but I call it\nmine); but I can't keep him long, for if my husband was to come home\nand find him here, he'd be rough in putting him out and might do him\na hurt. Hark! Here comes Liz back!\"\n\nThe other woman came hurriedly in as she spoke, and the boy got up\nwith a half-obscured sense that he was expected to be going. When the\nlittle child awoke, and when and how Charley got at it, took it out\nof bed, and began to walk about hushing it, I don't know. There she\nwas, doing all this in a quiet motherly manner as if she were living\nin Mrs. Blinder's attic with Tom and Emma again.\n\nThe friend had been here and there, and had been played about from\nhand to hand, and had come back as she went. At first it was too\nearly for the boy to be received into the proper refuge, and at last\nit was too late. One official sent her to another, and the other sent\nher back again to the first, and so backward and forward, until it\nappeared to me as if both must have been appointed for their skill in\nevading their duties instead of performing them. And now, after all,\nshe said, breathing quickly, for she had been running and was\nfrightened too, \"Jenny, your master's on the road home, and mine's\nnot far behind, and the Lord help the boy, for we can do no more for\nhim!\" They put a few halfpence together and hurried them into his\nhand, and so, in an oblivious, half-thankful, half-insensible way, he\nshuffled out of the house.\n\n\"Give me the child, my dear,\" said its mother to Charley, \"and thank\nyou kindly too! Jenny, woman dear, good night! Young lady, if my\nmaster don't fall out with me, I'll look down by the kiln by and by,\nwhere the boy will be most like, and again in the morning!\" She\nhurried off, and presently we passed her hushing and singing to her\nchild at her own door and looking anxiously along the road for her\ndrunken husband.\n\nI was afraid of staying then to speak to either woman, lest I should\nbring her into trouble. But I said to Charley that we must not leave\nthe boy to die. Charley, who knew what to do much better than I did,\nand whose quickness equalled her presence of mind, glided on before\nme, and presently we came up with Jo, just short of the brick-kiln.\n\nI think he must have begun his journey with some small bundle under\nhis arm and must have had it stolen or lost it. For he still carried\nhis wretched fragment of fur cap like a bundle, though he went\nbare-headed through the rain, which now fell fast. He stopped when we\ncalled to him and again showed a dread of me when I came up, standing\nwith his lustrous eyes fixed upon me, and even arrested in his\nshivering fit.\n\nI asked him to come with us, and we would take care that he had some\nshelter for the night.\n\n\"I don't want no shelter,\" he said; \"I can lay amongst the warm\nbricks.\"\n\n\"But don't you know that people die there?\" replied Charley.\n\n\"They dies everywheres,\" said the boy. \"They dies in their\nlodgings--she knows where; I showed her--and they dies down in\nTom-all-Alone's in heaps. They dies more than they lives, according\nto what I see.\" Then he hoarsely whispered Charley, \"If she ain't the\nt'other one, she ain't the forrenner. Is there THREE of 'em then?\"\n\nCharley looked at me a little frightened. I felt half frightened at\nmyself when the boy glared on me so.\n\nBut he turned and followed when I beckoned to him, and finding that\nhe acknowledged that influence in me, I led the way straight home. It\nwas not far, only at the summit of the hill. We passed but one man. I\ndoubted if we should have got home without assistance, the boy's\nsteps were so uncertain and tremulous. He made no complaint, however,\nand was strangely unconcerned about himself, if I may say so strange\na thing.\n\nLeaving him in the hall for a moment, shrunk into the corner of the\nwindow-seat and staring with an indifference that scarcely could be\ncalled wonder at the comfort and brightness about him, I went into\nthe drawing-room to speak to my guardian. There I found Mr. Skimpole,\nwho had come down by the coach, as he frequently did without notice,\nand never bringing any clothes with him, but always borrowing\neverything he wanted.\n\nThey came out with me directly to look at the boy. The servants had\ngathered in the hall too, and he shivered in the window-seat with\nCharley standing by him, like some wounded animal that had been found\nin a ditch.\n\n\"This is a sorrowful case,\" said my guardian after asking him a\nquestion or two and touching him and examining his eyes. \"What do you\nsay, Harold?\"\n\n\"You had better turn him out,\" said Mr. Skimpole.\n\n\"What do you mean?\" inquired my guardian, almost sternly.\n\n\"My dear Jarndyce,\" said Mr. Skimpole, \"you know what I am: I am a\nchild. Be cross to me if I deserve it. But I have a constitutional\nobjection to this sort of thing. I always had, when I was a medical\nman. He's not safe, you know. There's a very bad sort of fever about\nhim.\"\n\nMr. Skimpole had retreated from the hall to the drawing-room again\nand said this in his airy way, seated on the music-stool as we stood\nby.\n\n\"You'll say it's childish,\" observed Mr. Skimpole, looking gaily at\nus. \"Well, I dare say it may be; but I AM a child, and I never\npretend to be anything else. If you put him out in the road, you only\nput him where he was before. He will be no worse off than he was, you\nknow. Even make him better off, if you like. Give him sixpence, or\nfive shillings, or five pound ten--you are arithmeticians, and I am\nnot--and get rid of him!\"\n\n\"And what is he to do then?\" asked my guardian.\n\n\"Upon my life,\" said Mr. Skimpole, shrugging his shoulders with his\nengaging smile, \"I have not the least idea what he is to do then. But\nI have no doubt he'll do it.\"\n\n\"Now, is it not a horrible reflection,\" said my guardian, to whom I\nhad hastily explained the unavailing efforts of the two women, \"is it\nnot a horrible reflection,\" walking up and down and rumpling his\nhair, \"that if this wretched creature were a convicted prisoner, his\nhospital would be wide open to him, and he would be as well taken\ncare of as any sick boy in the kingdom?\"\n\n\"My dear Jarndyce,\" returned Mr. Skimpole, \"you'll pardon the\nsimplicity of the question, coming as it does from a creature who is\nperfectly simple in worldly matters, but why ISN'T he a prisoner\nthen?\"\n\nMy guardian stopped and looked at him with a whimsical mixture of\namusement and indignation in his face.\n\n\"Our young friend is not to be suspected of any delicacy, I should\nimagine,\" said Mr. Skimpole, unabashed and candid. \"It seems to me\nthat it would be wiser, as well as in a certain kind of way more\nrespectable, if he showed some misdirected energy that got him into\nprison. There would be more of an adventurous spirit in it, and\nconsequently more of a certain sort of poetry.\"\n\n\"I believe,\" returned my guardian, resuming his uneasy walk, \"that\nthere is not such another child on earth as yourself.\"\n\n\"Do you really?\" said Mr. Skimpole. \"I dare say! But I confess I\ndon't see why our young friend, in his degree, should not seek to\ninvest himself with such poetry as is open to him. He is no doubt\nborn with an appetite--probably, when he is in a safer state of\nhealth, he has an excellent appetite. Very well. At our young\nfriend's natural dinner hour, most likely about noon, our young\nfriend says in effect to society, 'I am hungry; will you have the\ngoodness to produce your spoon and feed me?' Society, which has taken\nupon itself the general arrangement of the whole system of spoons and\nprofesses to have a spoon for our young friend, does NOT produce that\nspoon; and our young friend, therefore, says 'You really must excuse\nme if I seize it.' Now, this appears to me a case of misdirected\nenergy, which has a certain amount of reason in it and a certain\namount of romance; and I don't know but what I should be more\ninterested in our young friend, as an illustration of such a case,\nthan merely as a poor vagabond--which any one can be.\"\n\n\"In the meantime,\" I ventured to observe, \"he is getting worse.\"\n\n\"In the meantime,\" said Mr. Skimpole cheerfully, \"as Miss Summerson,\nwith her practical good sense, observes, he is getting worse.\nTherefore I recommend your turning him out before he gets still\nworse.\"\n\nThe amiable face with which he said it, I think I shall never forget.\n\n\"Of course, little woman,\" observed my guardian, turning to me, \"I\ncan ensure his admission into the proper place by merely going there\nto enforce it, though it's a bad state of things when, in his\ncondition, that is necessary. But it's growing late, and is a very\nbad night, and the boy is worn out already. There is a bed in the\nwholesome loft-room by the stable; we had better keep him there till\nmorning, when he can be wrapped up and removed. We'll do that.\"\n\n\"Oh!\" said Mr. Skimpole, with his hands upon the keys of the piano as\nwe moved away. \"Are you going back to our young friend?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said my guardian.\n\n\"How I envy you your constitution, Jarndyce!\" returned Mr. Skimpole\nwith playful admiration. \"You don't mind these things; neither does\nMiss Summerson. You are ready at all times to go anywhere, and do\nanything. Such is will! I have no will at all--and no won't--simply\ncan't.\"\n\n\"You can't recommend anything for the boy, I suppose?\" said my\nguardian, looking back over his shoulder half angrily; only half\nangrily, for he never seemed to consider Mr. Skimpole an accountable\nbeing.\n\n\"My dear Jarndyce, I observed a bottle of cooling medicine in his\npocket, and it's impossible for him to do better than take it. You\ncan tell them to sprinkle a little vinegar about the place where he\nsleeps and to keep it moderately cool and him moderately warm. But it\nis mere impertinence in me to offer any recommendation. Miss\nSummerson has such a knowledge of detail and such a capacity for the\nadministration of detail that she knows all about it.\"\n\nWe went back into the hall and explained to Jo what we proposed to\ndo, which Charley explained to him again and which he received with\nthe languid unconcern I had already noticed, wearily looking on at\nwhat was done as if it were for somebody else. The servants\ncompassionating his miserable state and being very anxious to help,\nwe soon got the loft-room ready; and some of the men about the house\ncarried him across the wet yard, well wrapped up. It was pleasant to\nobserve how kind they were to him and how there appeared to be a\ngeneral impression among them that frequently calling him \"Old Chap\"\nwas likely to revive his spirits. Charley directed the operations and\nwent to and fro between the loft-room and the house with such little\nstimulants and comforts as we thought it safe to give him. My\nguardian himself saw him before he was left for the night and\nreported to me when he returned to the growlery to write a letter on\nthe boy's behalf, which a messenger was charged to deliver at\nday-light in the morning, that he seemed easier and inclined to\nsleep. They had fastened his door on the outside, he said, in case of\nhis being delirious, but had so arranged that he could not make any\nnoise without being heard.\n\nAda being in our room with a cold, Mr. Skimpole was left alone all\nthis time and entertained himself by playing snatches of pathetic\nairs and sometimes singing to them (as we heard at a distance) with\ngreat expression and feeling. When we rejoined him in the\ndrawing-room he said he would give us a little ballad which had come\ninto his head \"apropos of our young friend,\" and he sang one about a\npeasant boy,\n\n   \"Thrown on the wide world, doomed to wander and roam,\n    Bereft of his parents, bereft of a home.\"\n\nquite exquisitely. It was a song that always made him cry, he told\nus.\n\nHe was extremely gay all the rest of the evening, for he absolutely\nchirped--those were his delighted words--when he thought by what a\nhappy talent for business he was surrounded. He gave us, in his glass\nof negus, \"Better health to our young friend!\" and supposed and gaily\npursued the case of his being reserved like Whittington to become\nLord Mayor of London. In that event, no doubt, he would establish the\nJarndyce Institution and the Summerson Almshouses, and a little\nannual Corporation Pilgrimage to St. Albans. He had no doubt, he\nsaid, that our young friend was an excellent boy in his way, but his\nway was not the Harold Skimpole way; what Harold Skimpole was, Harold\nSkimpole had found himself, to his considerable surprise, when he\nfirst made his own acquaintance; he had accepted himself with all his\nfailings and had thought it sound philosophy to make the best of the\nbargain; and he hoped we would do the same.\n\nCharley's last report was that the boy was quiet. I could see, from\nmy window, the lantern they had left him burning quietly; and I went\nto bed very happy to think that he was sheltered.\n\nThere was more movement and more talking than usual a little before\ndaybreak, and it awoke me. As I was dressing, I looked out of my\nwindow and asked one of our men who had been among the active\nsympathizers last night whether there was anything wrong about the\nhouse. The lantern was still burning in the loft-window.\n\n\"It's the boy, miss,\" said he.\n\n\"Is he worse?\" I inquired.\n\n\"Gone, miss.\n\n\"Dead!\"\n\n\"Dead, miss? No. Gone clean off.\"\n\nAt what time of the night he had gone, or how, or why, it seemed\nhopeless ever to divine. The door remaining as it had been left, and\nthe lantern standing in the window, it could only be supposed that he\nhad got out by a trap in the floor which communicated with an empty\ncart-house below. But he had shut it down again, if that were so; and\nit looked as if it had not been raised. Nothing of any kind was\nmissing. On this fact being clearly ascertained, we all yielded to\nthe painful belief that delirium had come upon him in the night and\nthat, allured by some imaginary object or pursued by some imaginary\nhorror, he had strayed away in that worse than helpless state; all of\nus, that is to say, but Mr. Skimpole, who repeatedly suggested, in\nhis usual easy light style, that it had occurred to our young friend\nthat he was not a safe inmate, having a bad kind of fever upon him,\nand that he had with great natural politeness taken himself off.\n\nEvery possible inquiry was made, and every place was searched. The\nbrick-kilns were examined, the cottages were visited, the two women\nwere particularly questioned, but they knew nothing of him, and\nnobody could doubt that their wonder was genuine. The weather had for\nsome time been too wet and the night itself had been too wet to admit\nof any tracing by footsteps. Hedge and ditch, and wall, and rick and\nstack, were examined by our men for a long distance round, lest the\nboy should be lying in such a place insensible or dead; but nothing\nwas seen to indicate that he had ever been near. From the time when\nhe was left in the loft-room, he vanished.\n\nThe search continued for five days. I do not mean that it ceased even\nthen, but that my attention was then diverted into a current very\nmemorable to me.\n\nAs Charley was at her writing again in my room in the evening, and as\nI sat opposite to her at work, I felt the table tremble. Looking up,\nI saw my little maid shivering from head to foot.\n\n\"Charley,\" said I, \"are you so cold?\"\n\n\"I think I am, miss,\" she replied. \"I don't know what it is. I can't\nhold myself still. I felt so yesterday at about this same time, miss.\nDon't be uneasy, I think I'm ill.\"\n\nI heard Ada's voice outside, and I hurried to the door of\ncommunication between my room and our pretty sitting-room, and locked\nit. Just in time, for she tapped at it while my hand was yet upon the\nkey.\n\nAda called to me to let her in, but I said, \"Not now, my dearest. Go\naway. There's nothing the matter; I will come to you presently.\" Ah!\nIt was a long, long time before my darling girl and I were companions\nagain.\n\nCharley fell ill. In twelve hours she was very ill. I moved her to my\nroom, and laid her in my bed, and sat down quietly to nurse her. I\ntold my guardian all about it, and why I felt it was necessary that I\nshould seclude myself, and my reason for not seeing my darling above\nall. At first she came very often to the door, and called to me, and\neven reproached me with sobs and tears; but I wrote her a long letter\nsaying that she made me anxious and unhappy and imploring her, as she\nloved me and wished my mind to be at peace, to come no nearer than\nthe garden. After that she came beneath the window even oftener than\nshe had come to the door, and if I had learnt to love her dear sweet\nvoice before when we were hardly ever apart, how did I learn to love\nit then, when I stood behind the window-curtain listening and\nreplying, but not so much as looking out! How did I learn to love it\nafterwards, when the harder time came!\n\nThey put a bed for me in our sitting-room; and by keeping the door\nwide open, I turned the two rooms into one, now that Ada had vacated\nthat part of the house, and kept them always fresh and airy. There\nwas not a servant in or about the house but was so good that they\nwould all most gladly have come to me at any hour of the day or night\nwithout the least fear or unwillingness, but I thought it best to\nchoose one worthy woman who was never to see Ada and whom I could\ntrust to come and go with all precaution. Through her means I got out\nto take the air with my guardian when there was no fear of meeting\nAda, and wanted for nothing in the way of attendance, any more than\nin any other respect.\n\nAnd thus poor Charley sickened and grew worse, and fell into heavy\ndanger of death, and lay severely ill for many a long round of day\nand night. So patient she was, so uncomplaining, and inspired by such\na gentle fortitude that very often as I sat by Charley holding her\nhead in my arms--repose would come to her, so, when it would come to\nher in no other attitude--I silently prayed to our Father in heaven\nthat I might not forget the lesson which this little sister taught\nme.\n\nI was very sorrowful to think that Charley's pretty looks would\nchange and be disfigured, even if she recovered--she was such a child\nwith her dimpled face--but that thought was, for the greater part,\nlost in her greater peril. When she was at the worst, and her mind\nrambled again to the cares of her father's sick bed and the little\nchildren, she still knew me so far as that she would be quiet in my\narms when she could lie quiet nowhere else, and murmur out the\nwanderings of her mind less restlessly. At those times I used to\nthink, how should I ever tell the two remaining babies that the baby\nwho had learned of her faithful heart to be a mother to them in their\nneed was dead!\n\nThere were other times when Charley knew me well and talked to me,\ntelling me that she sent her love to Tom and Emma and that she was\nsure Tom would grow up to be a good man. At those times Charley would\nspeak to me of what she had read to her father as well as she could\nto comfort him, of that young man carried out to be buried who was\nthe only son of his mother and she was a widow, of the ruler's\ndaughter raised up by the gracious hand upon her bed of death. And\nCharley told me that when her father died she had kneeled down and\nprayed in her first sorrow that he likewise might be raised up and\ngiven back to his poor children, and that if she should never get\nbetter and should die too, she thought it likely that it might come\ninto Tom's mind to offer the same prayer for her. Then would I show\nTom how these people of old days had been brought back to life on\nearth, only that we might know our hope to be restored to heaven!\n\nBut of all the various times there were in Charley's illness, there\nwas not one when she lost the gentle qualities I have spoken of. And\nthere were many, many when I thought in the night of the last high\nbelief in the watching angel, and the last higher trust in God, on\nthe part of her poor despised father.\n\nAnd Charley did not die. She flutteringly and slowly turned the\ndangerous point, after long lingering there, and then began to mend.\nThe hope that never had been given, from the first, of Charley being\nin outward appearance Charley any more soon began to be encouraged;\nand even that prospered, and I saw her growing into her old childish\nlikeness again.\n\nIt was a great morning when I could tell Ada all this as she stood\nout in the garden; and it was a great evening when Charley and I at\nlast took tea together in the next room. But on that same evening, I\nfelt that I was stricken cold.\n\nHappily for both of us, it was not until Charley was safe in bed\nagain and placidly asleep that I began to think the contagion of her\nillness was upon me. I had been able easily to hide what I felt at\ntea-time, but I was past that already now, and I knew that I was\nrapidly following in Charley's steps.\n\nI was well enough, however, to be up early in the morning, and to\nreturn my darling's cheerful blessing from the garden, and to talk\nwith her as long as usual. But I was not free from an impression that\nI had been walking about the two rooms in the night, a little beside\nmyself, though knowing where I was; and I felt confused at\ntimes--with a curious sense of fullness, as if I were becoming too\nlarge altogether.\n\nIn the evening I was so much worse that I resolved to prepare\nCharley, with which view I said, \"You're getting quite strong,\nCharley, are you not?'\n\n\"Oh, quite!\" said Charley.\n\n\"Strong enough to be told a secret, I think, Charley?\"\n\n\"Quite strong enough for that, miss!\" cried Charley. But Charley's\nface fell in the height of her delight, for she saw the secret in MY\nface; and she came out of the great chair, and fell upon my bosom,\nand said \"Oh, miss, it's my doing! It's my doing!\" and a great deal\nmore out of the fullness of her grateful heart.\n\n\"Now, Charley,\" said I after letting her go on for a little while,\n\"if I am to be ill, my great trust, humanly speaking, is in you. And\nunless you are as quiet and composed for me as you always were for\nyourself, you can never fulfil it, Charley.\"\n\n\"If you'll let me cry a little longer, miss,\" said Charley. \"Oh, my\ndear, my dear! If you'll only let me cry a little longer. Oh, my\ndear!\"--how affectionately and devotedly she poured this out as she\nclung to my neck, I never can remember without tears--\"I'll be good.\"\n\nSo I let Charley cry a little longer, and it did us both good.\n\n\"Trust in me now, if you please, miss,\" said Charley quietly. \"I am\nlistening to everything you say.\"\n\n\"It's very little at present, Charley. I shall tell your doctor\nto-night that I don't think I am well and that you are going to nurse\nme.\"\n\nFor that the poor child thanked me with her whole heart. \"And in the\nmorning, when you hear Miss Ada in the garden, if I should not be\nquite able to go to the window-curtain as usual, do you go, Charley,\nand say I am asleep--that I have rather tired myself, and am asleep.\nAt all times keep the room as I have kept it, Charley, and let no one\ncome.\"\n\nCharley promised, and I lay down, for I was very heavy. I saw the\ndoctor that night and asked the favour of him that I wished to ask\nrelative to his saying nothing of my illness in the house as yet. I\nhave a very indistinct remembrance of that night melting into day,\nand of day melting into night again; but I was just able on the first\nmorning to get to the window and speak to my darling.\n\nOn the second morning I heard her dear voice--Oh, how dear\nnow!--outside; and I asked Charley, with some difficulty (speech\nbeing painful to me), to go and say I was asleep. I heard her answer\nsoftly, \"Don't disturb her, Charley, for the world!\"\n\n\"How does my own Pride look, Charley?\" I inquired.\n\n\"Disappointed, miss,\" said Charley, peeping through the curtain.\n\n\"But I know she is very beautiful this morning.\"\n\n\"She is indeed, miss,\" answered Charley, peeping. \"Still looking up\nat the window.\"\n\nWith her blue clear eyes, God bless them, always loveliest when\nraised like that!\n\nI called Charley to me and gave her her last charge.\n\n\"Now, Charley, when she knows I am ill, she will try to make her way\ninto the room. Keep her out, Charley, if you love me truly, to the\nlast! Charley, if you let her in but once, only to look upon me for\none moment as I lie here, I shall die.\"\n\n\"I never will! I never will!\" she promised me.\n\n\"I believe it, my dear Charley. And now come and sit beside me for a\nlittle while, and touch me with your hand. For I cannot see you,\nCharley; I am blind.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXII\n\nThe Appointed Time\n\n\nIt is night in Lincoln's Inn--perplexed and troublous valley of the\nshadow of the law, where suitors generally find but little day--and\nfat candles are snuffed out in offices, and clerks have rattled down\nthe crazy wooden stairs and dispersed. The bell that rings at nine\no'clock has ceased its doleful clangour about nothing; the gates are\nshut; and the night-porter, a solemn warder with a mighty power of\nsleep, keeps guard in his lodge. From tiers of staircase windows\nclogged lamps like the eyes of Equity, bleared Argus with a\nfathomless pocket for every eye and an eye upon it, dimly blink at\nthe stars. In dirty upper casements, here and there, hazy little\npatches of candlelight reveal where some wise draughtsman and\nconveyancer yet toils for the entanglement of real estate in meshes\nof sheep-skin, in the average ratio of about a dozen of sheep to an\nacre of land. Over which bee-like industry these benefactors of their\nspecies linger yet, though office-hours be past, that they may give,\nfor every day, some good account at last.\n\nIn the neighbouring court, where the Lord Chancellor of the rag and\nbottle shop dwells, there is a general tendency towards beer and\nsupper. Mrs. Piper and Mrs. Perkins, whose respective sons, engaged\nwith a circle of acquaintance in the game of hide and seek, have been\nlying in ambush about the by-ways of Chancery Lane for some hours and\nscouring the plain of the same thoroughfare to the confusion of\npassengers--Mrs. Piper and Mrs. Perkins have but now exchanged\ncongratulations on the children being abed, and they still linger on\na door-step over a few parting words. Mr. Krook and his lodger, and\nthe fact of Mr. Krook's being \"continually in liquor,\" and the\ntestamentary prospects of the young man are, as usual, the staple of\ntheir conversation. But they have something to say, likewise, of the\nHarmonic Meeting at the Sol's Arms, where the sound of the piano\nthrough the partly opened windows jingles out into the court, and\nwhere Little Swills, after keeping the lovers of harmony in a roar\nlike a very Yorick, may now be heard taking the gruff line in a\nconcerted piece and sentimentally adjuring his friends and patrons to\n\"Listen, listen, listen, tew the wa-ter fall!\" Mrs. Perkins and Mrs.\nPiper compare opinions on the subject of the young lady of\nprofessional celebrity who assists at the Harmonic Meetings and who\nhas a space to herself in the manuscript announcement in the window,\nMrs. Perkins possessing information that she has been married a year\nand a half, though announced as Miss M. Melvilleson, the noted siren,\nand that her baby is clandestinely conveyed to the Sol's Arms every\nnight to receive its natural nourishment during the entertainments.\n\"Sooner than which, myself,\" says Mrs. Perkins, \"I would get my\nliving by selling lucifers.\" Mrs. Piper, as in duty bound, is of the\nsame opinion, holding that a private station is better than public\napplause, and thanking heaven for her own (and, by implication, Mrs.\nPerkins') respectability. By this time the pot-boy of the Sol's Arms\nappearing with her supper-pint well frothed, Mrs. Piper accepts that\ntankard and retires indoors, first giving a fair good night to Mrs.\nPerkins, who has had her own pint in her hand ever since it was\nfetched from the same hostelry by young Perkins before he was sent to\nbed. Now there is a sound of putting up shop-shutters in the court\nand a smell as of the smoking of pipes; and shooting stars are seen\nin upper windows, further indicating retirement to rest. Now, too,\nthe policeman begins to push at doors; to try fastenings; to be\nsuspicious of bundles; and to administer his beat, on the hypothesis\nthat every one is either robbing or being robbed.\n\nIt is a close night, though the damp cold is searching too, and there\nis a laggard mist a little way up in the air. It is a fine steaming\nnight to turn the slaughter-houses, the unwholesome trades, the\nsewerage, bad water, and burial-grounds to account, and give the\nregistrar of deaths some extra business. It may be something in the\nair--there is plenty in it--or it may be something in himself that is\nin fault; but Mr. Weevle, otherwise Jobling, is very ill at ease. He\ncomes and goes between his own room and the open street door twenty\ntimes an hour. He has been doing so ever since it fell dark. Since\nthe Chancellor shut up his shop, which he did very early to-night,\nMr. Weevle has been down and up, and down and up (with a cheap tight\nvelvet skull-cap on his head, making his whiskers look out of all\nproportion), oftener than before.\n\nIt is no phenomenon that Mr. Snagsby should be ill at ease too, for\nhe always is so, more or less, under the oppressive influence of the\nsecret that is upon him. Impelled by the mystery of which he is a\npartaker and yet in which he is not a sharer, Mr. Snagsby haunts what\nseems to be its fountain-head--the rag and bottle shop in the court.\nIt has an irresistible attraction for him. Even now, coming round by\nthe Sol's Arms with the intention of passing down the court, and out\nat the Chancery Lane end, and so terminating his unpremeditated\nafter-supper stroll of ten minutes' long from his own door and back\nagain, Mr. Snagsby approaches.\n\n\"What, Mr. Weevle?\" says the stationer, stopping to speak. \"Are YOU\nthere?\"\n\n\"Aye!\" says Weevle, \"Here I am, Mr. Snagsby.\"\n\n\"Airing yourself, as I am doing, before you go to bed?\" the stationer\ninquires.\n\n\"Why, there's not much air to be got here; and what there is, is not\nvery freshening,\" Weevle answers, glancing up and down the court.\n\n\"Very true, sir. Don't you observe,\" says Mr. Snagsby, pausing to\nsniff and taste the air a little, \"don't you observe, Mr. Weevle,\nthat you're--not to put too fine a point upon it--that you're rather\ngreasy here, sir?\"\n\n\"Why, I have noticed myself that there is a queer kind of flavour in\nthe place to-night,\" Mr. Weevle rejoins. \"I suppose it's chops at the\nSol's Arms.\"\n\n\"Chops, do you think? Oh! Chops, eh?\" Mr. Snagsby sniffs and tastes\nagain. \"Well, sir, I suppose it is. But I should say their cook at\nthe Sol wanted a little looking after. She has been burning 'em, sir!\nAnd I don't think\"--Mr. Snagsby sniffs and tastes again and then\nspits and wipes his mouth--\"I don't think--not to put too fine a\npoint upon it--that they were quite fresh when they were shown the\ngridiron.\"\n\n\"That's very likely. It's a tainting sort of weather.\"\n\n\"It IS a tainting sort of weather,\" says Mr. Snagsby, \"and I find it\nsinking to the spirits.\"\n\n\"By George! I find it gives me the horrors,\" returns Mr. Weevle.\n\n\"Then, you see, you live in a lonesome way, and in a lonesome room,\nwith a black circumstance hanging over it,\" says Mr. Snagsby, looking\nin past the other's shoulder along the dark passage and then falling\nback a step to look up at the house. \"I couldn't live in that room\nalone, as you do, sir. I should get so fidgety and worried of an\nevening, sometimes, that I should be driven to come to the door and\nstand here sooner than sit there. But then it's very true that you\ndidn't see, in your room, what I saw there. That makes a difference.\"\n\n\"I know quite enough about it,\" returns Tony.\n\n\"It's not agreeable, is it?\" pursues Mr. Snagsby, coughing his cough\nof mild persuasion behind his hand. \"Mr. Krook ought to consider it\nin the rent. I hope he does, I am sure.\"\n\n\"I hope he does,\" says Tony. \"But I doubt it.\"\n\n\"You find the rent too high, do you, sir?\" returns the stationer.\n\"Rents ARE high about here. I don't know how it is exactly, but the\nlaw seems to put things up in price. Not,\" adds Mr. Snagsby with his\napologetic cough, \"that I mean to say a word against the profession I\nget my living by.\"\n\nMr. Weevle again glances up and down the court and then looks at the\nstationer. Mr. Snagsby, blankly catching his eye, looks upward for a\nstar or so and coughs a cough expressive of not exactly seeing his\nway out of this conversation.\n\n\"It's a curious fact, sir,\" he observes, slowly rubbing his hands,\n\"that he should have been--\"\n\n\"Who's he?\" interrupts Mr. Weevle.\n\n\"The deceased, you know,\" says Mr. Snagsby, twitching his head and\nright eyebrow towards the staircase and tapping his acquaintance on\nthe button.\n\n\"Ah, to be sure!\" returns the other as if he were not over-fond of\nthe subject. \"I thought we had done with him.\"\n\n\"I was only going to say it's a curious fact, sir, that he should\nhave come and lived here, and been one of my writers, and then that\nyou should come and live here, and be one of my writers too. Which\nthere is nothing derogatory, but far from it in the appellation,\"\nsays Mr. Snagsby, breaking off with a mistrust that he may have\nunpolitely asserted a kind of proprietorship in Mr. Weevle, \"because\nI have known writers that have gone into brewers' houses and done\nreally very respectable indeed. Eminently respectable, sir,\" adds Mr.\nSnagsby with a misgiving that he has not improved the matter.\n\n\"It's a curious coincidence, as you say,\" answers Weevle, once more\nglancing up and down the court.\n\n\"Seems a fate in it, don't there?\" suggests the stationer.\n\n\"There does.\"\n\n\"Just so,\" observes the stationer with his confirmatory cough. \"Quite\na fate in it. Quite a fate. Well, Mr. Weevle, I am afraid I must bid\nyou good night\"--Mr. Snagsby speaks as if it made him desolate to go,\nthough he has been casting about for any means of escape ever since\nhe stopped to speak--\"my little woman will be looking for me else.\nGood night, sir!\"\n\nIf Mr. Snagsby hastens home to save his little woman the trouble of\nlooking for him, he might set his mind at rest on that score. His\nlittle woman has had her eye upon him round the Sol's Arms all this\ntime and now glides after him with a pocket handkerchief wrapped over\nher head, honouring Mr. Weevle and his doorway with a searching\nglance as she goes past.\n\n\"You'll know me again, ma'am, at all events,\" says Mr. Weevle to\nhimself; \"and I can't compliment you on your appearance, whoever you\nare, with your head tied up in a bundle. Is this fellow NEVER\ncoming!\"\n\nThis fellow approaches as he speaks. Mr. Weevle softly holds up his\nfinger, and draws him into the passage, and closes the street door.\nThen they go upstairs, Mr. Weevle heavily, and Mr. Guppy (for it is\nhe) very lightly indeed. When they are shut into the back room, they\nspeak low.\n\n\"I thought you had gone to Jericho at least instead of coming here,\"\nsays Tony.\n\n\"Why, I said about ten.\"\n\n\"You said about ten,\" Tony repeats. \"Yes, so you did say about ten.\nBut according to my count, it's ten times ten--it's a hundred\no'clock. I never had such a night in my life!\"\n\n\"What has been the matter?\"\n\n\"That's it!\" says Tony. \"Nothing has been the matter. But here have I\nbeen stewing and fuming in this jolly old crib till I have had the\nhorrors falling on me as thick as hail. THERE'S a blessed-looking\ncandle!\" says Tony, pointing to the heavily burning taper on his\ntable with a great cabbage head and a long winding-sheet.\n\n\"That's easily improved,\" Mr. Guppy observes as he takes the snuffers\nin hand.\n\n\"IS it?\" returns his friend. \"Not so easily as you think. It has been\nsmouldering like that ever since it was lighted.\"\n\n\"Why, what's the matter with you, Tony?\" inquires Mr. Guppy, looking\nat him, snuffers in hand, as he sits down with his elbow on the\ntable.\n\n\"William Guppy,\" replies the other, \"I am in the downs. It's this\nunbearably dull, suicidal room--and old Boguey downstairs, I\nsuppose.\" Mr. Weevle moodily pushes the snuffers-tray from him with\nhis elbow, leans his head on his hand, puts his feet on the fender,\nand looks at the fire. Mr. Guppy, observing him, slightly tosses his\nhead and sits down on the other side of the table in an easy\nattitude.\n\n\"Wasn't that Snagsby talking to you, Tony?\"\n\n\"Yes, and he--yes, it was Snagsby,\" said Mr. Weevle, altering the\nconstruction of his sentence.\n\n\"On business?\"\n\n\"No. No business. He was only sauntering by and stopped to prose.\"\n\n\"I thought it was Snagsby,\" says Mr. Guppy, \"and thought it as well\nthat he shouldn't see me, so I waited till he was gone.\"\n\n\"There we go again, William G.!\" cried Tony, looking up for an\ninstant. \"So mysterious and secret! By George, if we were going to\ncommit a murder, we couldn't have more mystery about it!\"\n\nMr. Guppy affects to smile, and with the view of changing the\nconversation, looks with an admiration, real or pretended, round the\nroom at the Galaxy Gallery of British Beauty, terminating his survey\nwith the portrait of Lady Dedlock over the mantelshelf, in which she\nis represented on a terrace, with a pedestal upon the terrace, and a\nvase upon the pedestal, and her shawl upon the vase, and a prodigious\npiece of fur upon the shawl, and her arm on the prodigious piece of\nfur, and a bracelet on her arm.\n\n\"That's very like Lady Dedlock,\" says Mr. Guppy. \"It's a speaking\nlikeness.\"\n\n\"I wish it was,\" growls Tony, without changing his position. \"I\nshould have some fashionable conversation, here, then.\"\n\nFinding by this time that his friend is not to be wheedled into a\nmore sociable humour, Mr. Guppy puts about upon the ill-used tack and\nremonstrates with him.\n\n\"Tony,\" says he, \"I can make allowances for lowness of spirits, for\nno man knows what it is when it does come upon a man better than I\ndo, and no man perhaps has a better right to know it than a man who\nhas an unrequited image imprinted on his 'eart. But there are bounds\nto these things when an unoffending party is in question, and I will\nacknowledge to you, Tony, that I don't think your manner on the\npresent occasion is hospitable or quite gentlemanly.\"\n\n\"This is strong language, William Guppy,\" returns Mr. Weevle.\n\n\"Sir, it may be,\" retorts Mr. William Guppy, \"but I feel strongly\nwhen I use it.\"\n\nMr. Weevle admits that he has been wrong and begs Mr. William Guppy\nto think no more about it. Mr. William Guppy, however, having got the\nadvantage, cannot quite release it without a little more injured\nremonstrance.\n\n\"No! Dash it, Tony,\" says that gentleman, \"you really ought to be\ncareful how you wound the feelings of a man who has an unrequited\nimage imprinted on his 'eart and who is NOT altogether happy in those\nchords which vibrate to the tenderest emotions. You, Tony, possess in\nyourself all that is calculated to charm the eye and allure the\ntaste. It is not--happily for you, perhaps, and I may wish that I\ncould say the same--it is not your character to hover around one\nflower. The ole garden is open to you, and your airy pinions carry\nyou through it. Still, Tony, far be it from me, I am sure, to wound\neven your feelings without a cause!\"\n\nTony again entreats that the subject may be no longer pursued, saying\nemphatically, \"William Guppy, drop it!\" Mr. Guppy acquiesces, with\nthe reply, \"I never should have taken it up, Tony, of my own accord.\"\n\n\"And now,\" says Tony, stirring the fire, \"touching this same bundle\nof letters. Isn't it an extraordinary thing of Krook to have\nappointed twelve o'clock to-night to hand 'em over to me?\"\n\n\"Very. What did he do it for?\"\n\n\"What does he do anything for? HE don't know. Said to-day was his\nbirthday and he'd hand 'em over to-night at twelve o'clock. He'll\nhave drunk himself blind by that time. He has been at it all day.\"\n\n\"He hasn't forgotten the appointment, I hope?\"\n\n\"Forgotten? Trust him for that. He never forgets anything. I saw him\nto-night, about eight--helped him to shut up his shop--and he had got\nthe letters then in his hairy cap. He pulled it off and showed 'em\nme. When the shop was closed, he took them out of his cap, hung his\ncap on the chair-back, and stood turning them over before the fire. I\nheard him a little while afterwards, through the floor here, humming\nlike the wind, the only song he knows--about Bibo, and old Charon,\nand Bibo being drunk when he died, or something or other. He has been\nas quiet since as an old rat asleep in his hole.\"\n\n\"And you are to go down at twelve?\"\n\n\"At twelve. And as I tell you, when you came it seemed to me a\nhundred.\"\n\n\"Tony,\" says Mr. Guppy after considering a little with his legs\ncrossed, \"he can't read yet, can he?\"\n\n\"Read! He'll never read. He can make all the letters separately, and\nhe knows most of them separately when he sees them; he has got on\nthat much, under me; but he can't put them together. He's too old to\nacquire the knack of it now--and too drunk.\"\n\n\"Tony,\" says Mr. Guppy, uncrossing and recrossing his legs, \"how do\nyou suppose he spelt out that name of Hawdon?\"\n\n\"He never spelt it out. You know what a curious power of eye he has\nand how he has been used to employ himself in copying things by eye\nalone. He imitated it, evidently from the direction of a letter, and\nasked me what it meant.\"\n\n\"Tony,\" says Mr. Guppy, uncrossing and recrossing his legs again,\n\"should you say that the original was a man's writing or a woman's?\"\n\n\"A woman's. Fifty to one a lady's--slopes a good deal, and the end of\nthe letter 'n,' long and hasty.\"\n\nMr. Guppy has been biting his thumb-nail during this dialogue,\ngenerally changing the thumb when he has changed the cross leg. As he\nis going to do so again, he happens to look at his coat-sleeve. It\ntakes his attention. He stares at it, aghast.\n\n\"Why, Tony, what on earth is going on in this house to-night? Is\nthere a chimney on fire?\"\n\n\"Chimney on fire!\"\n\n\"Ah!\" returns Mr. Guppy. \"See how the soot's falling. See here, on my\narm! See again, on the table here! Confound the stuff, it won't blow\noff--smears like black fat!\"\n\nThey look at one another, and Tony goes listening to the door, and a\nlittle way upstairs, and a little way downstairs. Comes back and says\nit's all right and all quiet, and quotes the remark he lately made to\nMr. Snagsby about their cooking chops at the Sol's Arms.\n\n\"And it was then,\" resumes Mr. Guppy, still glancing with remarkable\naversion at the coat-sleeve, as they pursue their conversation before\nthe fire, leaning on opposite sides of the table, with their heads\nvery near together, \"that he told you of his having taken the bundle\nof letters from his lodger's portmanteau?\"\n\n\"That was the time, sir,\" answers Tony, faintly adjusting his\nwhiskers. \"Whereupon I wrote a line to my dear boy, the Honourable\nWilliam Guppy, informing him of the appointment for to-night and\nadvising him not to call before, Boguey being a slyboots.\"\n\nThe light vivacious tone of fashionable life which is usually assumed\nby Mr. Weevle sits so ill upon him to-night that he abandons that and\nhis whiskers together, and after looking over his shoulder, appears\nto yield himself up a prey to the horrors again.\n\n\"You are to bring the letters to your room to read and compare, and\nto get yourself into a position to tell him all about them. That's\nthe arrangement, isn't it, Tony?\" asks Mr. Guppy, anxiously biting\nhis thumb-nail.\n\n\"You can't speak too low. Yes. That's what he and I agreed.\"\n\n\"I tell you what, Tony--\"\n\n\"You can't speak too low,\" says Tony once more. Mr. Guppy nods his\nsagacious head, advances it yet closer, and drops into a whisper.\n\n\"I tell you what. The first thing to be done is to make another\npacket like the real one so that if he should ask to see the real one\nwhile it's in my possession, you can show him the dummy.\"\n\n\"And suppose he detects the dummy as soon as he sees it, which with\nhis biting screw of an eye is about five hundred times more likely\nthan not,\" suggests Tony.\n\n\"Then we'll face it out. They don't belong to him, and they never\ndid. You found that, and you placed them in my hands--a legal friend\nof yours--for security. If he forces us to it, they'll be producible,\nwon't they?\"\n\n\"Ye-es,\" is Mr. Weevle's reluctant admission.\n\n\"Why, Tony,\" remonstrates his friend, \"how you look! You don't doubt\nWilliam Guppy? You don't suspect any harm?\"\n\n\"I don't suspect anything more than I know, William,\" returns the\nother gravely.\n\n\"And what do you know?\" urges Mr. Guppy, raising his voice a little;\nbut on his friend's once more warning him, \"I tell you, you can't\nspeak too low,\" he repeats his question without any sound at all,\nforming with his lips only the words, \"What do you know?\"\n\n\"I know three things. First, I know that here we are whispering in\nsecrecy, a pair of conspirators.\"\n\n\"Well!\" says Mr. Guppy. \"And we had better be that than a pair of\nnoodles, which we should be if we were doing anything else, for it's\nthe only way of doing what we want to do. Secondly?\"\n\n\"Secondly, it's not made out to me how it's likely to be profitable,\nafter all.\"\n\nMr. Guppy casts up his eyes at the portrait of Lady Dedlock over the\nmantelshelf and replies, \"Tony, you are asked to leave that to the\nhonour of your friend. Besides its being calculated to serve that\nfriend in those chords of the human mind which--which need not be\ncalled into agonizing vibration on the present occasion--your friend\nis no fool. What's that?\"\n\n\"It's eleven o'clock striking by the bell of Saint Paul's. Listen and\nyou'll hear all the bells in the city jangling.\"\n\nBoth sit silent, listening to the metal voices, near and distant,\nresounding from towers of various heights, in tones more various than\ntheir situations. When these at length cease, all seems more\nmysterious and quiet than before. One disagreeable result of\nwhispering is that it seems to evoke an atmosphere of silence,\nhaunted by the ghosts of sound--strange cracks and tickings, the\nrustling of garments that have no substance in them, and the tread of\ndreadful feet that would leave no mark on the sea-sand or the winter\nsnow. So sensitive the two friends happen to be that the air is full\nof these phantoms, and the two look over their shoulders by one\nconsent to see that the door is shut.\n\n\"Yes, Tony?\" says Mr. Guppy, drawing nearer to the fire and biting\nhis unsteady thumb-nail. \"You were going to say, thirdly?\"\n\n\"It's far from a pleasant thing to be plotting about a dead man in\nthe room where he died, especially when you happen to live in it.\"\n\n\"But we are plotting nothing against him, Tony.\"\n\n\"May be not, still I don't like it. Live here by yourself and see how\nYOU like it.\"\n\n\"As to dead men, Tony,\" proceeds Mr. Guppy, evading this proposal,\n\"there have been dead men in most rooms.\"\n\n\"I know there have, but in most rooms you let them alone, and--and\nthey let you alone,\" Tony answers.\n\nThe two look at each other again. Mr. Guppy makes a hurried remark to\nthe effect that they may be doing the deceased a service, that he\nhopes so. There is an oppressive blank until Mr. Weevle, by stirring\nthe fire suddenly, makes Mr. Guppy start as if his heart had been\nstirred instead.\n\n\"Fah! Here's more of this hateful soot hanging about,\" says he. \"Let\nus open the window a bit and get a mouthful of air. It's too close.\"\n\nHe raises the sash, and they both rest on the window-sill, half in\nand half out of the room. The neighbouring houses are too near to\nadmit of their seeing any sky without craning their necks and looking\nup, but lights in frowsy windows here and there, and the rolling of\ndistant carriages, and the new expression that there is of the stir\nof men, they find to be comfortable. Mr. Guppy, noiselessly tapping\non the window-sill, resumes his whispering in quite a light-comedy\ntone.\n\n\"By the by, Tony, don't forget old Smallweed,\" meaning the younger of\nthat name. \"I have not let him into this, you know. That grandfather\nof his is too keen by half. It runs in the family.\"\n\n\"I remember,\" says Tony. \"I am up to all that.\"\n\n\"And as to Krook,\" resumes Mr. Guppy. \"Now, do you suppose he really\nhas got hold of any other papers of importance, as he has boasted to\nyou, since you have been such allies?\"\n\nTony shakes his head. \"I don't know. Can't Imagine. If we get through\nthis business without rousing his suspicions, I shall be better\ninformed, no doubt. How can I know without seeing them, when he don't\nknow himself? He is always spelling out words from them, and chalking\nthem over the table and the shop-wall, and asking what this is and\nwhat that is; but his whole stock from beginning to end may easily be\nthe waste-paper he bought it as, for anything I can say. It's a\nmonomania with him to think he is possessed of documents. He has been\ngoing to learn to read them this last quarter of a century, I should\njudge, from what he tells me.\"\n\n\"How did he first come by that idea, though? That's the question,\"\nMr. Guppy suggests with one eye shut, after a little forensic\nmeditation. \"He may have found papers in something he bought, where\npapers were not supposed to be, and may have got it into his shrewd\nhead from the manner and place of their concealment that they are\nworth something.\"\n\n\"Or he may have been taken in, in some pretended bargain. Or he may\nhave been muddled altogether by long staring at whatever he HAS got,\nand by drink, and by hanging about the Lord Chancellor's Court and\nhearing of documents for ever,\" returns Mr. Weevle.\n\nMr. Guppy sitting on the window-sill, nodding his head and balancing\nall these possibilities in his mind, continues thoughtfully to tap\nit, and clasp it, and measure it with his hand, until he hastily\ndraws his hand away.\n\n\"What, in the devil's name,\" he says, \"is this! Look at my fingers!\"\n\nA thick, yellow liquor defiles them, which is offensive to the touch\nand sight and more offensive to the smell. A stagnant, sickening oil\nwith some natural repulsion in it that makes them both shudder.\n\n\"What have you been doing here? What have you been pouring out of\nwindow?\"\n\n\"I pouring out of window! Nothing, I swear! Never, since I have been\nhere!\" cries the lodger.\n\nAnd yet look here--and look here! When he brings the candle here,\nfrom the corner of the window-sill, it slowly drips and creeps away\ndown the bricks, here lies in a little thick nauseous pool.\n\n\"This is a horrible house,\" says Mr. Guppy, shutting down the window.\n\"Give me some water or I shall cut my hand off.\"\n\nHe so washes, and rubs, and scrubs, and smells, and washes, that he\nhas not long restored himself with a glass of brandy and stood\nsilently before the fire when Saint Paul's bell strikes twelve and\nall those other bells strike twelve from their towers of various\nheights in the dark air, and in their many tones. When all is quiet\nagain, the lodger says, \"It's the appointed time at last. Shall I\ngo?\"\n\nMr. Guppy nods and gives him a \"lucky touch\" on the back, but not\nwith the washed hand, though it is his right hand.\n\nHe goes downstairs, and Mr. Guppy tries to compose himself before the\nfire for waiting a long time. But in no more than a minute or two the\nstairs creak and Tony comes swiftly back.\n\n\"Have you got them?\"\n\n\"Got them! No. The old man's not there.\"\n\nHe has been so horribly frightened in the short interval that his\nterror seizes the other, who makes a rush at him and asks loudly,\n\"What's the matter?\"\n\n\"I couldn't make him hear, and I softly opened the door and looked\nin. And the burning smell is there--and the soot is there, and the\noil is there--and he is not there!\" Tony ends this with a groan.\n\nMr. Guppy takes the light. They go down, more dead than alive, and\nholding one another, push open the door of the back shop. The cat has\nretreated close to it and stands snarling, not at them, at something\non the ground before the fire. There is a very little fire left in\nthe grate, but there is a smouldering, suffocating vapour in the room\nand a dark, greasy coating on the walls and ceiling. The chairs and\ntable, and the bottle so rarely absent from the table, all stand as\nusual. On one chair-back hang the old man's hairy cap and coat.\n\n\"Look!\" whispers the lodger, pointing his friend's attention to these\nobjects with a trembling finger. \"I told you so. When I saw him last,\nhe took his cap off, took out the little bundle of old letters, hung\nhis cap on the back of the chair--his coat was there already, for he\nhad pulled that off before he went to put the shutters up--and I left\nhim turning the letters over in his hand, standing just where that\ncrumbled black thing is upon the floor.\"\n\nIs he hanging somewhere? They look up. No.\n\n\"See!\" whispers Tony. \"At the foot of the same chair there lies a\ndirty bit of thin red cord that they tie up pens with. That went\nround the letters. He undid it slowly, leering and laughing at me,\nbefore he began to turn them over, and threw it there. I saw it\nfall.\"\n\n\"What's the matter with the cat?\" says Mr. Guppy. \"Look at her!\"\n\n\"Mad, I think. And no wonder in this evil place.\"\n\nThey advance slowly, looking at all these things. The cat remains\nwhere they found her, still snarling at the something on the ground\nbefore the fire and between the two chairs. What is it? Hold up the\nlight.\n\nHere is a small burnt patch of flooring; here is the tinder from a\nlittle bundle of burnt paper, but not so light as usual, seeming to\nbe steeped in something; and here is--is it the cinder of a small\ncharred and broken log of wood sprinkled with white ashes, or is it\ncoal? Oh, horror, he IS here! And this from which we run away,\nstriking out the light and overturning one another into the street,\nis all that represents him.\n\nHelp, help, help! Come into this house for heaven's sake! Plenty will\ncome in, but none can help. The Lord Chancellor of that court, true\nto his title in his last act, has died the death of all lord\nchancellors in all courts and of all authorities in all places under\nall names soever, where false pretences are made, and where injustice\nis done. Call the death by any name your Highness will, attribute\nit to whom you will, or say it might have been prevented how you\nwill, it is the same death eternally--inborn, inbred, engendered\nin the corrupted humours of the vicious body itself, and that\nonly--spontaneous combustion, and none other of all the deaths that\ncan be died.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXIII\n\nInterlopers\n\n\nNow do those two gentlemen not very neat about the cuffs and buttons\nwho attended the last coroner's inquest at the Sol's Arms reappear in\nthe precincts with surprising swiftness (being, in fact, breathlessly\nfetched by the active and intelligent beadle), and institute\nperquisitions through the court, and dive into the Sol's parlour, and\nwrite with ravenous little pens on tissue-paper. Now do they note\ndown, in the watches of the night, how the neighbourhood of Chancery\nLane was yesterday, at about midnight, thrown into a state of the\nmost intense agitation and excitement by the following alarming and\nhorrible discovery. Now do they set forth how it will doubtless be\nremembered that some time back a painful sensation was created in the\npublic mind by a case of mysterious death from opium occurring in the\nfirst floor of the house occupied as a rag, bottle, and general\nmarine store shop, by an eccentric individual of intemperate habits,\nfar advanced in life, named Krook; and how, by a remarkable\ncoincidence, Krook was examined at the inquest, which it may be\nrecollected was held on that occasion at the Sol's Arms, a\nwell-conducted tavern immediately adjoining the premises in question\non the west side and licensed to a highly respectable landlord, Mr.\nJames George Bogsby. Now do they show (in as many words as possible)\nhow during some hours of yesterday evening a very peculiar smell was\nobserved by the inhabitants of the court, in which the tragical\noccurrence which forms the subject of that present account\ntranspired; and which odour was at one time so powerful that Mr.\nSwills, a comic vocalist professionally engaged by Mr. J. G. Bogsby,\nhas himself stated to our reporter that he mentioned to Miss M.\nMelvilleson, a lady of some pretensions to musical ability, likewise\nengaged by Mr. J. G. Bogsby to sing at a series of concerts called\nHarmonic Assemblies, or Meetings, which it would appear are held at\nthe Sol's Arms under Mr. Bogsby's direction pursuant to the Act of\nGeorge the Second, that he (Mr. Swills) found his voice seriously\naffected by the impure state of the atmosphere, his jocose expression\nat the time being that he was like an empty post-office, for he\nhadn't a single note in him. How this account of Mr. Swills is\nentirely corroborated by two intelligent married females residing in\nthe same court and known respectively by the names of Mrs. Piper and\nMrs. Perkins, both of whom observed the foetid effluvia and regarded\nthem as being emitted from the premises in the occupation of Krook,\nthe unfortunate deceased. All this and a great deal more the two\ngentlemen who have formed an amicable partnership in the melancholy\ncatastrophe write down on the spot; and the boy population of the\ncourt (out of bed in a moment) swarm up the shutters of the Sol's\nArms parlour, to behold the tops of their heads while they are about\nit.\n\nThe whole court, adult as well as boy, is sleepless for that night,\nand can do nothing but wrap up its many heads, and talk of the\nill-fated house, and look at it. Miss Flite has been bravely rescued\nfrom her chamber, as if it were in flames, and accommodated with a\nbed at the Sol's Arms. The Sol neither turns off its gas nor shuts\nits door all night, for any kind of public excitement makes good for\nthe Sol and causes the court to stand in need of comfort. The house\nhas not done so much in the stomachic article of cloves or in\nbrandy-and-water warm since the inquest. The moment the pot-boy heard\nwhat had happened, he rolled up his shirt-sleeves tight to his\nshoulders and said, \"There'll be a run upon us!\" In the first outcry,\nyoung Piper dashed off for the fire-engines and returned in triumph\nat a jolting gallop perched up aloft on the Phoenix and holding on to\nthat fabulous creature with all his might in the midst of helmets and\ntorches. One helmet remains behind after careful investigation of all\nchinks and crannies and slowly paces up and down before the house in\ncompany with one of the two policemen who have likewise been left in\ncharge thereof. To this trio everybody in the court possessed of\nsixpence has an insatiate desire to exhibit hospitality in a liquid\nform.\n\nMr. Weevle and his friend Mr. Guppy are within the bar at the Sol and\nare worth anything to the Sol that the bar contains if they will only\nstay there. \"This is not a time,\" says Mr. Bogsby, \"to haggle about\nmoney,\" though he looks something sharply after it, over the counter;\n\"give your orders, you two gentlemen, and you're welcome to whatever\nyou put a name to.\"\n\nThus entreated, the two gentlemen (Mr. Weevle especially) put names\nto so many things that in course of time they find it difficult to\nput a name to anything quite distinctly, though they still relate to\nall new-comers some version of the night they have had of it, and of\nwhat they said, and what they thought, and what they saw. Meanwhile,\none or other of the policemen often flits about the door, and pushing\nit open a little way at the full length of his arm, looks in from\nouter gloom. Not that he has any suspicions, but that he may as well\nknow what they are up to in there.\n\nThus night pursues its leaden course, finding the court still out of\nbed through the unwonted hours, still treating and being treated,\nstill conducting itself similarly to a court that has had a little\nmoney left it unexpectedly. Thus night at length with slow-retreating\nsteps departs, and the lamp-lighter going his rounds, like an\nexecutioner to a despotic king, strikes off the little heads of fire\nthat have aspired to lessen the darkness. Thus the day cometh,\nwhether or no.\n\nAnd the day may discern, even with its dim London eye, that the court\nhas been up all night. Over and above the faces that have fallen\ndrowsily on tables and the heels that lie prone on hard floors\ninstead of beds, the brick and mortar physiognomy of the very court\nitself looks worn and jaded. And now the neighbourhood, waking up and\nbeginning to hear of what has happened, comes streaming in, half\ndressed, to ask questions; and the two policemen and the helmet (who\nare far less impressible externally than the court) have enough to do\nto keep the door.\n\n\"Good gracious, gentlemen!\" says Mr. Snagsby, coming up. \"What's this\nI hear!\"\n\n\"Why, it's true,\" returns one of the policemen. \"That's what it is.\nNow move on here, come!\"\n\n\"Why, good gracious, gentlemen,\" says Mr. Snagsby, somewhat promptly\nbacked away, \"I was at this door last night betwixt ten and eleven\no'clock in conversation with the young man who lodges here.\"\n\n\"Indeed?\" returns the policeman. \"You will find the young man next\ndoor then. Now move on here, some of you.\"\n\n\"Not hurt, I hope?\" says Mr. Snagsby.\n\n\"Hurt? No. What's to hurt him!\"\n\nMr. Snagsby, wholly unable to answer this or any question in his\ntroubled mind, repairs to the Sol's Arms and finds Mr. Weevle\nlanguishing over tea and toast with a considerable expression on him\nof exhausted excitement and exhausted tobacco-smoke.\n\n\"And Mr. Guppy likewise!\" quoth Mr. Snagsby. \"Dear, dear, dear! What\na fate there seems in all this! And my lit--\"\n\nMr. Snagsby's power of speech deserts him in the formation of the\nwords \"my little woman.\" For to see that injured female walk into the\nSol's Arms at that hour of the morning and stand before the\nbeer-engine, with her eyes fixed upon him like an accusing spirit,\nstrikes him dumb.\n\n\"My dear,\" says Mr. Snagsby when his tongue is loosened, \"will you\ntake anything? A little--not to put too fine a point upon it--drop of\nshrub?\"\n\n\"No,\" says Mrs. Snagsby.\n\n\"My love, you know these two gentlemen?\"\n\n\"Yes!\" says Mrs. Snagsby, and in a rigid manner acknowledges their\npresence, still fixing Mr. Snagsby with her eye.\n\nThe devoted Mr. Snagsby cannot bear this treatment. He takes Mrs.\nSnagsby by the hand and leads her aside to an adjacent cask.\n\n\"My little woman, why do you look at me in that way? Pray don't do\nit.\"\n\n\"I can't help my looks,\" says Mrs. Snagsby, \"and if I could I\nwouldn't.\"\n\nMr. Snagsby, with his cough of meekness, rejoins, \"Wouldn't you\nreally, my dear?\" and meditates. Then coughs his cough of trouble and\nsays, \"This is a dreadful mystery, my love!\" still fearfully\ndisconcerted by Mrs. Snagsby's eye.\n\n\"It IS,\" returns Mrs. Snagsby, shaking her head, \"a dreadful\nmystery.\"\n\n\"My little woman,\" urges Mr. Snagsby in a piteous manner, \"don't for\ngoodness' sake speak to me with that bitter expression and look at me\nin that searching way! I beg and entreat of you not to do it. Good\nLord, you don't suppose that I would go spontaneously combusting any\nperson, my dear?\"\n\n\"I can't say,\" returns Mrs. Snagsby.\n\nOn a hasty review of his unfortunate position, Mr. Snagsby \"can't\nsay\" either. He is not prepared positively to deny that he may have\nhad something to do with it. He has had something--he don't know\nwhat--to do with so much in this connexion that is mysterious that it\nis possible he may even be implicated, without knowing it, in the\npresent transaction. He faintly wipes his forehead with his\nhandkerchief and gasps.\n\n\"My life,\" says the unhappy stationer, \"would you have any objections\nto mention why, being in general so delicately circumspect in your\nconduct, you come into a wine-vaults before breakfast?\"\n\n\"Why do YOU come here?\" inquires Mrs. Snagsby.\n\n\"My dear, merely to know the rights of the fatal accident which has\nhappened to the venerable party who has been--combusted.\" Mr. Snagsby\nhas made a pause to suppress a groan. \"I should then have related\nthem to you, my love, over your French roll.\"\n\n\"I dare say you would! You relate everything to me, Mr. Snagsby.\"\n\n\"Every--my lit--\"\n\n\"I should be glad,\" says Mrs. Snagsby after contemplating his\nincreased confusion with a severe and sinister smile, \"if you would\ncome home with me; I think you may be safer there, Mr. Snagsby, than\nanywhere else.\"\n\n\"My love, I don't know but what I may be, I am sure. I am ready to\ngo.\"\n\nMr. Snagsby casts his eye forlornly round the bar, gives Messrs.\nWeevle and Guppy good morning, assures them of the satisfaction with\nwhich he sees them uninjured, and accompanies Mrs. Snagsby from the\nSol's Arms. Before night his doubt whether he may not be responsible\nfor some inconceivable part in the catastrophe which is the talk of\nthe whole neighbourhood is almost resolved into certainty by Mrs.\nSnagsby's pertinacity in that fixed gaze. His mental sufferings are\nso great that he entertains wandering ideas of delivering himself up\nto justice and requiring to be cleared if innocent and punished with\nthe utmost rigour of the law if guilty.\n\nMr. Weevle and Mr. Guppy, having taken their breakfast, step into\nLincoln's Inn to take a little walk about the square and clear as\nmany of the dark cobwebs out of their brains as a little walk may.\n\n\"There can be no more favourable time than the present, Tony,\" says\nMr. Guppy after they have broodingly made out the four sides of the\nsquare, \"for a word or two between us upon a point on which we must,\nwith very little delay, come to an understanding.\"\n\n\"Now, I tell you what, William G.!\" returns the other, eyeing his\ncompanion with a bloodshot eye. \"If it's a point of conspiracy, you\nneedn't take the trouble to mention it. I have had enough of that,\nand I ain't going to have any more. We shall have YOU taking fire\nnext or blowing up with a bang.\"\n\nThis supposititious phenomenon is so very disagreeable to Mr. Guppy\nthat his voice quakes as he says in a moral way, \"Tony, I should have\nthought that what we went through last night would have been a lesson\nto you never to be personal any more as long as you lived.\" To which\nMr. Weevle returns, \"William, I should have thought it would have\nbeen a lesson to YOU never to conspire any more as long as you\nlived.\" To which Mr. Guppy says, \"Who's conspiring?\" To which Mr.\nJobling replies, \"Why, YOU are!\" To which Mr. Guppy retorts, \"No, I\nam not.\" To which Mr. Jobling retorts again, \"Yes, you are!\" To which\nMr. Guppy retorts, \"Who says so?\" To which Mr. Jobling retorts, \"I\nsay so!\" To which Mr. Guppy retorts, \"Oh, indeed?\" To which Mr.\nJobling retorts, \"Yes, indeed!\" And both being now in a heated state,\nthey walk on silently for a while to cool down again.\n\n\"Tony,\" says Mr. Guppy then, \"if you heard your friend out instead of\nflying at him, you wouldn't fall into mistakes. But your temper is\nhasty and you are not considerate. Possessing in yourself, Tony, all\nthat is calculated to charm the eye--\"\n\n\"Oh! Blow the eye!\" cries Mr. Weevle, cutting him short. \"Say what\nyou have got to say!\"\n\nFinding his friend in this morose and material condition, Mr. Guppy\nonly expresses the finer feelings of his soul through the tone of\ninjury in which he recommences, \"Tony, when I say there is a point on\nwhich we must come to an understanding pretty soon, I say so quite\napart from any kind of conspiring, however innocent. You know it is\nprofessionally arranged beforehand in all cases that are tried what\nfacts the witnesses are to prove. Is it or is it not desirable that\nwe should know what facts we are to prove on the inquiry into the\ndeath of this unfortunate old mo--gentleman?\" (Mr. Guppy was going to\nsay \"mogul,\" but thinks \"gentleman\" better suited to the\ncircumstances.)\n\n\"What facts? THE facts.\"\n\n\"The facts bearing on that inquiry. Those are\"--Mr. Guppy tells them\noff on his fingers--\"what we knew of his habits, when you saw him\nlast, what his condition was then, the discovery that we made, and\nhow we made it.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" says Mr. Weevle. \"Those are about the facts.\"\n\n\"We made the discovery in consequence of his having, in his eccentric\nway, an appointment with you at twelve o'clock at night, when you\nwere to explain some writing to him as you had often done before on\naccount of his not being able to read. I, spending the evening with\nyou, was called down--and so forth. The inquiry being only into the\ncircumstances touching the death of the deceased, it's not necessary\nto go beyond these facts, I suppose you'll agree?\"\n\n\"No!\" returns Mr. Weevle. \"I suppose not.\"\n\n\"And this is not a conspiracy, perhaps?\" says the injured Guppy.\n\n\"No,\" returns his friend; \"if it's nothing worse than this, I\nwithdraw the observation.\"\n\n\"Now, Tony,\" says Mr. Guppy, taking his arm again and walking him\nslowly on, \"I should like to know, in a friendly way, whether you\nhave yet thought over the many advantages of your continuing to live\nat that place?\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\" says Tony, stopping.\n\n\"Whether you have yet thought over the many advantages of your\ncontinuing to live at that place?\" repeats Mr. Guppy, walking him on\nagain.\n\n\"At what place? THAT place?\" pointing in the direction of the rag and\nbottle shop.\n\nMr. Guppy nods.\n\n\"Why, I wouldn't pass another night there for any consideration that\nyou could offer me,\" says Mr. Weevle, haggardly staring.\n\n\"Do you mean it though, Tony?\"\n\n\"Mean it! Do I look as if I mean it? I feel as if I do; I know that,\"\nsays Mr. Weevle with a very genuine shudder.\n\n\"Then the possibility or probability--for such it must be\nconsidered--of your never being disturbed in possession of those\neffects lately belonging to a lone old man who seemed to have no\nrelation in the world, and the certainty of your being able to find\nout what he really had got stored up there, don't weigh with you at\nall against last night, Tony, if I understand you?\" says Mr. Guppy,\nbiting his thumb with the appetite of vexation.\n\n\"Certainly not. Talk in that cool way of a fellow's living there?\"\ncries Mr. Weevle indignantly. \"Go and live there yourself.\"\n\n\"Oh! I, Tony!\" says Mr. Guppy, soothing him. \"I have never lived\nthere and couldn't get a lodging there now, whereas you have got\none.\"\n\n\"You are welcome to it,\" rejoins his friend, \"and--ugh!--you may make\nyourself at home in it.\"\n\n\"Then you really and truly at this point,\" says Mr. Guppy, \"give up\nthe whole thing, if I understand you, Tony?\"\n\n\"You never,\" returns Tony with a most convincing steadfastness, \"said\na truer word in all your life. I do!\"\n\nWhile they are so conversing, a hackney-coach drives into the square,\non the box of which vehicle a very tall hat makes itself manifest to\nthe public. Inside the coach, and consequently not so manifest to the\nmultitude, though sufficiently so to the two friends, for the coach\nstops almost at their feet, are the venerable Mr. Smallweed and Mrs.\nSmallweed, accompanied by their granddaughter Judy.\n\nAn air of haste and excitement pervades the party, and as the tall\nhat (surmounting Mr. Smallweed the younger) alights, Mr. Smallweed\nthe elder pokes his head out of window and bawls to Mr. Guppy, \"How\nde do, sir! How de do!\"\n\n\"What do Chick and his family want here at this time of the morning,\nI wonder!\" says Mr. Guppy, nodding to his familiar.\n\n\"My dear sir,\" cries Grandfather Smallweed, \"would you do me a\nfavour? Would you and your friend be so very obleeging as to carry me\ninto the public-house in the court, while Bart and his sister bring\ntheir grandmother along? Would you do an old man that good turn,\nsir?\"\n\nMr. Guppy looks at his friend, repeating inquiringly, \"The\npublic-house in the court?\" And they prepare to bear the venerable\nburden to the Sol's Arms.\n\n\"There's your fare!\" says the patriarch to the coachman with a fierce\ngrin and shaking his incapable fist at him. \"Ask me for a penny more,\nand I'll have my lawful revenge upon you. My dear young men, be easy\nwith me, if you please. Allow me to catch you round the neck. I won't\nsqueeze you tighter than I can help. Oh, Lord! Oh, dear me! Oh, my\nbones!\"\n\nIt is well that the Sol is not far off, for Mr. Weevle presents an\napoplectic appearance before half the distance is accomplished. With\nno worse aggravation of his symptoms, however, than the utterance of\ndivers croaking sounds expressive of obstructed respiration, he\nfulfils his share of the porterage and the benevolent old gentleman\nis deposited by his own desire in the parlour of the Sol's Arms.\n\n\"Oh, Lord!\" gasps Mr. Smallweed, looking about him, breathless, from\nan arm-chair. \"Oh, dear me! Oh, my bones and back! Oh, my aches and\npains! Sit down, you dancing, prancing, shambling, scrambling\npoll-parrot! Sit down!\"\n\nThis little apostrophe to Mrs. Smallweed is occasioned by a\npropensity on the part of that unlucky old lady whenever she finds\nherself on her feet to amble about and \"set\" to inanimate objects,\naccompanying herself with a chattering noise, as in a witch dance. A\nnervous affection has probably as much to do with these\ndemonstrations as any imbecile intention in the poor old woman, but\non the present occasion they are so particularly lively in connexion\nwith the Windsor arm-chair, fellow to that in which Mr. Smallweed is\nseated, that she only quite desists when her grandchildren have held\nher down in it, her lord in the meanwhile bestowing upon her, with\ngreat volubility, the endearing epithet of \"a pig-headed jackdaw,\"\nrepeated a surprising number of times.\n\n\"My dear sir,\" Grandfather Smallweed then proceeds, addressing Mr.\nGuppy, \"there has been a calamity here. Have you heard of it, either\nof you?\"\n\n\"Heard of it, sir! Why, we discovered it.\"\n\n\"You discovered it. You two discovered it! Bart, THEY discovered it!\"\n\nThe two discoverers stare at the Smallweeds, who return the\ncompliment.\n\n\"My dear friends,\" whines Grandfather Smallweed, putting out both his\nhands, \"I owe you a thousand thanks for discharging the melancholy\noffice of discovering the ashes of Mrs. Smallweed's brother.\"\n\n\"Eh?\" says Mr. Guppy.\n\n\"Mrs. Smallweed's brother, my dear friend--her only relation. We were\nnot on terms, which is to be deplored now, but he never WOULD be on\nterms. He was not fond of us. He was eccentric--he was very\neccentric. Unless he has left a will (which is not at all likely) I\nshall take out letters of administration. I have come down to look\nafter the property; it must be sealed up, it must be protected. I\nhave come down,\" repeats Grandfather Smallweed, hooking the air\ntowards him with all his ten fingers at once, \"to look after the\nproperty.\"\n\n\"I think, Small,\" says the disconsolate Mr. Guppy, \"you might have\nmentioned that the old man was your uncle.\"\n\n\"You two were so close about him that I thought you would like me to\nbe the same,\" returns that old bird with a secretly glistening eye.\n\"Besides, I wasn't proud of him.\"\n\n\"Besides which, it was nothing to you, you know, whether he was or\nnot,\" says Judy. Also with a secretly glistening eye.\n\n\"He never saw me in his life to know me,\" observed Small; \"I don't\nknow why I should introduce HIM, I am sure!\"\n\n\"No, he never communicated with us, which is to be deplored,\" the old\ngentleman strikes in, \"but I have come to look after the property--to\nlook over the papers, and to look after the property. We shall make\ngood our title. It is in the hands of my solicitor. Mr. Tulkinghorn,\nof Lincoln's Inn Fields, over the way there, is so good as to act as\nmy solicitor; and grass don't grow under HIS feet, I can tell ye.\nKrook was Mrs. Smallweed's only brother; she had no relation but\nKrook, and Krook had no relation but Mrs. Smallweed. I am speaking of\nyour brother, you brimstone black-beetle, that was seventy-six years\nof age.\"\n\nMrs. Smallweed instantly begins to shake her head and pipe up,\n\"Seventy-six pound seven and sevenpence! Seventy-six thousand bags of\nmoney! Seventy-six hundred thousand million of parcels of\nbank-notes!\"\n\n\"Will somebody give me a quart pot?\" exclaims her exasperated\nhusband, looking helplessly about him and finding no missile within\nhis reach. \"Will somebody obleege me with a spittoon? Will somebody\nhand me anything hard and bruising to pelt at her? You hag, you cat,\nyou dog, you brimstone barker!\" Here Mr. Smallweed, wrought up to the\nhighest pitch by his own eloquence, actually throws Judy at her\ngrandmother in default of anything else, by butting that young virgin\nat the old lady with such force as he can muster and then dropping\ninto his chair in a heap.\n\n\"Shake me up, somebody, if you'll be so good,\" says the voice from\nwithin the faintly struggling bundle into which he has collapsed. \"I\nhave come to look after the property. Shake me up, and call in the\npolice on duty at the next house to be explained to about the\nproperty. My solicitor will be here presently to protect the\nproperty. Transportation or the gallows for anybody who shall touch\nthe property!\" As his dutiful grandchildren set him up, panting, and\nputting him through the usual restorative process of shaking and\npunching, he still repeats like an echo, \"The--the property! The\nproperty! Property!\"\n\nMr. Weevle and Mr. Guppy look at each other, the former as having\nrelinquished the whole affair, the latter with a discomfited\ncountenance as having entertained some lingering expectations yet.\nBut there is nothing to be done in opposition to the Smallweed\ninterest. Mr. Tulkinghorn's clerk comes down from his official pew in\nthe chambers to mention to the police that Mr. Tulkinghorn is\nanswerable for its being all correct about the next of kin and that\nthe papers and effects will be formally taken possession of in due\ntime and course. Mr. Smallweed is at once permitted so far to assert\nhis supremacy as to be carried on a visit of sentiment into the next\nhouse and upstairs into Miss Flite's deserted room, where he looks\nlike a hideous bird of prey newly added to her aviary.\n\nThe arrival of this unexpected heir soon taking wind in the court\nstill makes good for the Sol and keeps the court upon its mettle.\nMrs. Piper and Mrs. Perkins think it hard upon the young man if there\nreally is no will, and consider that a handsome present ought to be\nmade him out of the estate. Young Piper and young Perkins, as members\nof that restless juvenile circle which is the terror of the\nfoot-passengers in Chancery Lane, crumble into ashes behind the pump\nand under the archway all day long, where wild yells and hootings\ntake place over their remains. Little Swills and Miss M. Melvilleson\nenter into affable conversation with their patrons, feeling that\nthese unusual occurrences level the barriers between professionals\nand non-professionals. Mr. Bogsby puts up \"The popular song of King\nDeath, with chorus by the whole strength of the company,\" as the\ngreat Harmonic feature of the week and announces in the bill that \"J.\nG. B. is induced to do so at a considerable extra expense in\nconsequence of a wish which has been very generally expressed at the\nbar by a large body of respectable individuals and in homage to a\nlate melancholy event which has aroused so much sensation.\" There is\none point connected with the deceased upon which the court is\nparticularly anxious, namely, that the fiction of a full-sized coffin\nshould be preserved, though there is so little to put in it. Upon the\nundertaker's stating in the Sol's bar in the course of the day that\nhe has received orders to construct \"a six-footer,\" the general\nsolicitude is much relieved, and it is considered that Mr.\nSmallweed's conduct does him great honour.\n\nOut of the court, and a long way out of it, there is considerable\nexcitement too, for men of science and philosophy come to look, and\ncarriages set down doctors at the corner who arrive with the same\nintent, and there is more learned talk about inflammable gases and\nphosphuretted hydrogen than the court has ever imagined. Some of\nthese authorities (of course the wisest) hold with indignation that\nthe deceased had no business to die in the alleged manner; and being\nreminded by other authorities of a certain inquiry into the evidence\nfor such deaths reprinted in the sixth volume of the Philosophical\nTransactions; and also of a book not quite unknown on English medical\njurisprudence; and likewise of the Italian case of the Countess\nCornelia Baudi as set forth in detail by one Bianchini, prebendary of\nVerona, who wrote a scholarly work or so and was occasionally heard\nof in his time as having gleams of reason in him; and also of the\ntestimony of Messrs. Fodere and Mere, two pestilent Frenchmen who\nWOULD investigate the subject; and further, of the corroborative\ntestimony of Monsieur Le Cat, a rather celebrated French surgeon once\nupon a time, who had the unpoliteness to live in a house where such a\ncase occurred and even to write an account of it--still they regard\nthe late Mr. Krook's obstinacy in going out of the world by any such\nby-way as wholly unjustifiable and personally offensive. The less the\ncourt understands of all this, the more the court likes it, and the\ngreater enjoyment it has in the stock in trade of the Sol's Arms.\nThen there comes the artist of a picture newspaper, with a foreground\nand figures ready drawn for anything from a wreck on the Cornish\ncoast to a review in Hyde Park or a meeting in Manchester, and in\nMrs. Perkins' own room, memorable evermore, he then and there throws\nin upon the block Mr. Krook's house, as large as life; in fact,\nconsiderably larger, making a very temple of it. Similarly, being\npermitted to look in at the door of the fatal chamber, he depicts\nthat apartment as three-quarters of a mile long by fifty yards high,\nat which the court is particularly charmed. All this time the two\ngentlemen before mentioned pop in and out of every house and assist\nat the philosophical disputations--go everywhere and listen to\neverybody--and yet are always diving into the Sol's parlour and\nwriting with the ravenous little pens on the tissue-paper.\n\nAt last come the coroner and his inquiry, like as before, except that\nthe coroner cherishes this case as being out of the common way and\ntells the gentlemen of the jury, in his private capacity, that \"that\nwould seem to be an unlucky house next door, gentlemen, a destined\nhouse; but so we sometimes find it, and these are mysteries we can't\naccount for!\" After which the six-footer comes into action and is\nmuch admired.\n\nIn all these proceedings Mr. Guppy has so slight a part, except when\nhe gives his evidence, that he is moved on like a private individual\nand can only haunt the secret house on the outside, where he has the\nmortification of seeing Mr. Smallweed padlocking the door, and of\nbitterly knowing himself to be shut out. But before these proceedings\ndraw to a close, that is to say, on the night next after the\ncatastrophe, Mr. Guppy has a thing to say that must be said to Lady\nDedlock.\n\nFor which reason, with a sinking heart and with that hang-dog sense\nof guilt upon him which dread and watching enfolded in the Sol's Arms\nhave produced, the young man of the name of Guppy presents himself at\nthe town mansion at about seven o'clock in the evening and requests\nto see her ladyship. Mercury replies that she is going out to dinner;\ndon't he see the carriage at the door? Yes, he does see the carriage\nat the door; but he wants to see my Lady too.\n\nMercury is disposed, as he will presently declare to a\nfellow-gentleman in waiting, \"to pitch into the young man\"; but his\ninstructions are positive. Therefore he sulkily supposes that the\nyoung man must come up into the library. There he leaves the young\nman in a large room, not over-light, while he makes report of him.\n\nMr. Guppy looks into the shade in all directions, discovering\neverywhere a certain charred and whitened little heap of coal or\nwood. Presently he hears a rustling. Is it--? No, it's no ghost, but\nfair flesh and blood, most brilliantly dressed.\n\n\"I have to beg your ladyship's pardon,\" Mr. Guppy stammers, very\ndowncast. \"This is an inconvenient time--\"\n\n\"I told you, you could come at any time.\" She takes a chair, looking\nstraight at him as on the last occasion.\n\n\"Thank your ladyship. Your ladyship is very affable.\"\n\n\"You can sit down.\" There is not much affability in her tone.\n\n\"I don't know, your ladyship, that it's worth while my sitting down\nand detaining you, for I--I have not got the letters that I mentioned\nwhen I had the honour of waiting on your ladyship.\"\n\n\"Have you come merely to say so?\"\n\n\"Merely to say so, your ladyship.\" Mr. Guppy besides being depressed,\ndisappointed, and uneasy, is put at a further disadvantage by the\nsplendour and beauty of her appearance.\n\nShe knows its influence perfectly, has studied it too well to miss a\ngrain of its effect on any one. As she looks at him so steadily and\ncoldly, he not only feels conscious that he has no guide in the least\nperception of what is really the complexion of her thoughts, but also\nthat he is being every moment, as it were, removed further and\nfurther from her.\n\nShe will not speak, it is plain. So he must.\n\n\"In short, your ladyship,\" says Mr. Guppy like a meanly penitent\nthief, \"the person I was to have had the letters of, has come to a\nsudden end, and--\" He stops. Lady Dedlock calmly finishes the\nsentence.\n\n\"And the letters are destroyed with the person?\"\n\nMr. Guppy would say no if he could--as he is unable to hide.\n\n\"I believe so, your ladyship.\"\n\nIf he could see the least sparkle of relief in her face now? No, he\ncould see no such thing, even if that brave outside did not utterly\nput him away, and he were not looking beyond it and about it.\n\nHe falters an awkward excuse or two for his failure.\n\n\"Is this all you have to say?\" inquires Lady Dedlock, having heard\nhim out--or as nearly out as he can stumble.\n\nMr. Guppy thinks that's all.\n\n\"You had better be sure that you wish to say nothing more to me, this\nbeing the last time you will have the opportunity.\"\n\nMr. Guppy is quite sure. And indeed he has no such wish at present,\nby any means.\n\n\"That is enough. I will dispense with excuses. Good evening to you!\"\nAnd she rings for Mercury to show the young man of the name of Guppy\nout.\n\nBut in that house, in that same moment, there happens to be an old\nman of the name of Tulkinghorn. And that old man, coming with his\nquiet footstep to the library, has his hand at that moment on the\nhandle of the door--comes in--and comes face to face with the young\nman as he is leaving the room.\n\nOne glance between the old man and the lady, and for an instant the\nblind that is always down flies up. Suspicion, eager and sharp, looks\nout. Another instant, close again.\n\n\"I beg your pardon, Lady Dedlock. I beg your pardon a thousand times.\nIt is so very unusual to find you here at this hour. I supposed the\nroom was empty. I beg your pardon!\"\n\n\"Stay!\" She negligently calls him back. \"Remain here, I beg. I am\ngoing out to dinner. I have nothing more to say to this young man!\"\n\nThe disconcerted young man bows, as he goes out, and cringingly hopes\nthat Mr. Tulkinghorn of the Fields is well.\n\n\"Aye, aye?\" says the lawyer, looking at him from under his bent\nbrows, though he has no need to look again--not he. \"From Kenge and\nCarboy's, surely?\"\n\n\"Kenge and Carboy's, Mr. Tulkinghorn. Name of Guppy, sir.\"\n\n\"To be sure. Why, thank you, Mr. Guppy, I am very well!\"\n\n\"Happy to hear it, sir. You can't be too well, sir, for the credit of\nthe profession.\"\n\n\"Thank you, Mr. Guppy!\"\n\nMr. Guppy sneaks away. Mr. Tulkinghorn, such a foil in his\nold-fashioned rusty black to Lady Dedlock's brightness, hands her\ndown the staircase to her carriage. He returns rubbing his chin, and\nrubs it a good deal in the course of the evening.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXIV\n\nA Turn of the Screw\n\n\n\"Now, what,\" says Mr. George, \"may this be? Is it blank cartridge or\nball? A flash in the pan or a shot?\"\n\nAn open letter is the subject of the trooper's speculations, and it\nseems to perplex him mightily. He looks at it at arm's length, brings\nit close to him, holds it in his right hand, holds it in his left\nhand, reads it with his head on this side, with his head on that\nside, contracts his eyebrows, elevates them, still cannot satisfy\nhimself. He smooths it out upon the table with his heavy palm, and\nthoughtfully walking up and down the gallery, makes a halt before it\nevery now and then to come upon it with a fresh eye. Even that won't\ndo. \"Is it,\" Mr. George still muses, \"blank cartridge or ball?\"\n\nPhil Squod, with the aid of a brush and paint-pot, is employed in the\ndistance whitening the targets, softly whistling in quick-march time\nand in drum-and-fife manner that he must and will go back again to\nthe girl he left behind him.\n\n\"Phil!\" The trooper beckons as he calls him.\n\nPhil approaches in his usual way, sidling off at first as if he were\ngoing anywhere else and then bearing down upon his commander like a\nbayonet-charge. Certain splashes of white show in high relief upon\nhis dirty face, and he scrapes his one eyebrow with the handle of the\nbrush.\n\n\"Attention, Phil! Listen to this.\"\n\n\"Steady, commander, steady.\"\n\n\"'Sir. Allow me to remind you (though there is no legal necessity for\nmy doing so, as you are aware) that the bill at two months' date\ndrawn on yourself by Mr. Matthew Bagnet, and by you accepted, for the\nsum of ninety-seven pounds four shillings and ninepence, will become\ndue to-morrow, when you will please be prepared to take up the same\non presentation. Yours, Joshua Smallweed.' What do you make of that,\nPhil?\"\n\n\"Mischief, guv'ner.\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"I think,\" replies Phil after pensively tracing out a cross-wrinkle\nin his forehead with the brush-handle, \"that mischeevious\nconsequences is always meant when money's asked for.\"\n\n\"Lookye, Phil,\" says the trooper, sitting on the table. \"First and\nlast, I have paid, I may say, half as much again as this principal in\ninterest and one thing and another.\"\n\nPhil intimates by sidling back a pace or two, with a very\nunaccountable wrench of his wry face, that he does not regard the\ntransaction as being made more promising by this incident.\n\n\"And lookye further, Phil,\" says the trooper, staying his premature\nconclusions with a wave of his hand. \"There has always been an\nunderstanding that this bill was to be what they call renewed. And it\nhas been renewed no end of times. What do you say now?\"\n\n\"I say that I think the times is come to a end at last.\"\n\n\"You do? Humph! I am much of the same mind myself.\"\n\n\"Joshua Smallweed is him that was brought here in a chair?\"\n\n\"The same.\"\n\n\"Guv'ner,\" says Phil with exceeding gravity, \"he's a leech in his\ndispositions, he's a screw and a wice in his actions, a snake in his\ntwistings, and a lobster in his claws.\"\n\nHaving thus expressively uttered his sentiments, Mr. Squod, after\nwaiting a little to ascertain if any further remark be expected of\nhim, gets back by his usual series of movements to the target he has\nin hand and vigorously signifies through his former musical medium\nthat he must and he will return to that ideal young lady. George,\nhaving folded the letter, walks in that direction.\n\n\"There IS a way, commander,\" says Phil, looking cunningly at him, \"of\nsettling this.\"\n\n\"Paying the money, I suppose? I wish I could.\"\n\nPhil shakes his head. \"No, guv'ner, no; not so bad as that. There IS\na way,\" says Phil with a highly artistic turn of his brush; \"what I'm\na-doing at present.\"\n\n\"Whitewashing.\"\n\nPhil nods.\n\n\"A pretty way that would be! Do you know what would become of the\nBagnets in that case? Do you know they would be ruined to pay off my\nold scores? YOU'RE a moral character,\" says the trooper, eyeing him\nin his large way with no small indignation; \"upon my life you are,\nPhil!\"\n\nPhil, on one knee at the target, is in course of protesting\nearnestly, though not without many allegorical scoops of his brush\nand smoothings of the white surface round the rim with his thumb,\nthat he had forgotten the Bagnet responsibility and would not so much\nas injure a hair of the head of any member of that worthy family when\nsteps are audible in the long passage without, and a cheerful voice\nis heard to wonder whether George is at home. Phil, with a look at\nhis master, hobbles up, saying, \"Here's the guv'ner, Mrs. Bagnet!\nHere he is!\" and the old girl herself, accompanied by Mr. Bagnet,\nappears.\n\nThe old girl never appears in walking trim, in any season of the\nyear, without a grey cloth cloak, coarse and much worn but very\nclean, which is, undoubtedly, the identical garment rendered so\ninteresting to Mr. Bagnet by having made its way home to Europe from\nanother quarter of the globe in company with Mrs. Bagnet and an\numbrella. The latter faithful appendage is also invariably a part of\nthe old girl's presence out of doors. It is of no colour known in\nthis life and has a corrugated wooden crook for a handle, with a\nmetallic object let into its prow, or beak, resembling a little model\nof a fanlight over a street door or one of the oval glasses out of a\npair of spectacles, which ornamental object has not that tenacious\ncapacity of sticking to its post that might be desired in an article\nlong associated with the British army. The old girl's umbrella is of\na flabby habit of waist and seems to be in need of stays--an\nappearance that is possibly referable to its having served through a\nseries of years at home as a cupboard and on journeys as a carpet\nbag. She never puts it up, having the greatest reliance on her\nwell-proved cloak with its capacious hood, but generally uses the\ninstrument as a wand with which to point out joints of meat or\nbunches of greens in marketing or to arrest the attention of\ntradesmen by a friendly poke. Without her market-basket, which is a\nsort of wicker well with two flapping lids, she never stirs abroad.\nAttended by these her trusty companions, therefore, her honest\nsunburnt face looking cheerily out of a rough straw bonnet, Mrs.\nBagnet now arrives, fresh-coloured and bright, in George's Shooting\nGallery.\n\n\"Well, George, old fellow,\" says she, \"and how do YOU do, this\nsunshiny morning?\"\n\nGiving him a friendly shake of the hand, Mrs. Bagnet draws a long\nbreath after her walk and sits down to enjoy a rest. Having a\nfaculty, matured on the tops of baggage-waggons and in other such\npositions, of resting easily anywhere, she perches on a rough bench,\nunties her bonnet-strings, pushes back her bonnet, crosses her arms,\nand looks perfectly comfortable.\n\nMr. Bagnet in the meantime has shaken hands with his old comrade and\nwith Phil, on whom Mrs. Bagnet likewise bestows a good-humoured nod\nand smile.\n\n\"Now, George,\" said Mrs. Bagnet briskly, \"here we are, Lignum and\nmyself\"--she often speaks of her husband by this appellation, on\naccount, as it is supposed, of Lignum Vitae having been his old\nregimental nickname when they first became acquainted, in compliment\nto the extreme hardness and toughness of his physiognomy--\"just\nlooked in, we have, to make it all correct as usual about that\nsecurity. Give him the new bill to sign, George, and he'll sign it\nlike a man.\"\n\n\"I was coming to you this morning,\" observes the trooper reluctantly.\n\n\"Yes, we thought you'd come to us this morning, but we turned out\nearly and left Woolwich, the best of boys, to mind his sisters and\ncame to you instead--as you see! For Lignum, he's tied so close now,\nand gets so little exercise, that a walk does him good. But what's\nthe matter, George?\" asks Mrs. Bagnet, stopping in her cheerful talk.\n\"You don't look yourself.\"\n\n\"I am not quite myself,\" returns the trooper; \"I have been a little\nput out, Mrs. Bagnet.\"\n\nHer bright quick eye catches the truth directly. \"George!\" holding up\nher forefinger. \"Don't tell me there's anything wrong about that\nsecurity of Lignum's! Don't do it, George, on account of the\nchildren!\"\n\nThe trooper looks at her with a troubled visage.\n\n\"George,\" says Mrs. Bagnet, using both her arms for emphasis and\noccasionally bringing down her open hands upon her knees. \"If you\nhave allowed anything wrong to come to that security of Lignum's, and\nif you have let him in for it, and if you have put us in danger of\nbeing sold up--and I see sold up in your face, George, as plain as\nprint--you have done a shameful action and have deceived us cruelly.\nI tell you, cruelly, George. There!\"\n\nMr. Bagnet, otherwise as immovable as a pump or a lamp-post, puts his\nlarge right hand on the top of his bald head as if to defend it from\na shower-bath and looks with great uneasiness at Mrs. Bagnet.\n\n\"George,\" says that old girl, \"I wonder at you! George, I am ashamed\nof you! George, I couldn't have believed you would have done it! I\nalways knew you to be a rolling stone that gathered no moss, but I\nnever thought you would have taken away what little moss there was\nfor Bagnet and the children to lie upon. You know what a\nhard-working, steady-going chap he is. You know what Quebec and Malta\nand Woolwich are, and I never did think you would, or could, have had\nthe heart to serve us so. Oh, George!\" Mrs. Bagnet gathers up her\ncloak to wipe her eyes on in a very genuine manner, \"How could you do\nit?\"\n\nMrs. Bagnet ceasing, Mr. Bagnet removes his hand from his head as if\nthe shower-bath were over and looks disconsolately at Mr. George, who\nhas turned quite white and looks distressfully at the grey cloak and\nstraw bonnet.\n\n\"Mat,\" says the trooper in a subdued voice, addressing him but still\nlooking at his wife, \"I am sorry you take it so much to heart,\nbecause I do hope it's not so bad as that comes to. I certainly have,\nthis morning, received this letter\"--which he reads aloud--\"but I\nhope it may be set right yet. As to a rolling stone, why, what you\nsay is true. I AM a rolling stone, and I never rolled in anybody's\nway, I fully believe, that I rolled the least good to. But it's\nimpossible for an old vagabond comrade to like your wife and family\nbetter than I like 'em, Mat, and I trust you'll look upon me as\nforgivingly as you can. Don't think I've kept anything from you. I\nhaven't had the letter more than a quarter of an hour.\"\n\n\"Old girl,\" murmurs Mr. Bagnet after a short silence, \"will you tell\nhim my opinion?\"\n\n\"Oh! Why didn't he marry,\" Mrs. Bagnet answers, half laughing and\nhalf crying, \"Joe Pouch's widder in North America? Then he wouldn't\nhave got himself into these troubles.\"\n\n\"The old girl,\" says Mr. Bagnet, \"puts it correct--why didn't you?\"\n\n\"Well, she has a better husband by this time, I hope,\" returns the\ntrooper. \"Anyhow, here I stand, this present day, NOT married to Joe\nPouch's widder. What shall I do? You see all I have got about me.\nIt's not mine; it's yours. Give the word, and I'll sell off every\nmorsel. If I could have hoped it would have brought in nearly the sum\nwanted, I'd have sold all long ago. Don't believe that I'll leave you\nor yours in the lurch, Mat. I'd sell myself first. I only wish,\" says\nthe trooper, giving himself a disparaging blow in the chest, \"that I\nknew of any one who'd buy such a second-hand piece of old stores.\"\n\n\"Old girl,\" murmurs Mr. Bagnet, \"give him another bit of my mind.\"\n\n\"George,\" says the old girl, \"you are not so much to be blamed, on\nfull consideration, except for ever taking this business without the\nmeans.\"\n\n\"And that was like me!\" observes the penitent trooper, shaking his\nhead. \"Like me, I know.\"\n\n\"Silence! The old girl,\" says Mr. Bagnet, \"is correct--in her way of\ngiving my opinions--hear me out!\"\n\n\"That was when you never ought to have asked for the security,\nGeorge, and when you never ought to have got it, all things\nconsidered. But what's done can't be undone. You are always an\nhonourable and straightforward fellow, as far as lays in your power,\nthough a little flighty. On the other hand, you can't admit but what\nit's natural in us to be anxious with such a thing hanging over our\nheads. So forget and forgive all round, George. Come! Forget and\nforgive all round!\"\n\nMrs. Bagnet, giving him one of her honest hands and giving her\nhusband the other, Mr. George gives each of them one of his and holds\nthem while he speaks.\n\n\"I do assure you both, there's nothing I wouldn't do to discharge\nthis obligation. But whatever I have been able to scrape together has\ngone every two months in keeping it up. We have lived plainly enough\nhere, Phil and I. But the gallery don't quite do what was expected of\nit, and it's not--in short, it's not the mint. It was wrong in me to\ntake it? Well, so it was. But I was in a manner drawn into that step,\nand I thought it might steady me, and set me up, and you'll try to\noverlook my having such expectations, and upon my soul, I am very\nmuch obliged to you, and very much ashamed of myself.\" With these\nconcluding words, Mr. George gives a shake to each of the hands he\nholds, and relinquishing them, backs a pace or two in a\nbroad-chested, upright attitude, as if he had made a final confession\nand were immediately going to be shot with all military honours.\n\n\"George, hear me out!\" says Mr. Bagnet, glancing at his wife. \"Old\ngirl, go on!\"\n\nMr. Bagnet, being in this singular manner heard out, has merely to\nobserve that the letter must be attended to without any delay, that\nit is advisable that George and he should immediately wait on Mr.\nSmallweed in person, and that the primary object is to save and hold\nharmless Mr. Bagnet, who had none of the money. Mr. George, entirely\nassenting, puts on his hat and prepares to march with Mr. Bagnet to\nthe enemy's camp.\n\n\"Don't you mind a woman's hasty word, George,\" says Mrs. Bagnet,\npatting him on the shoulder. \"I trust my old Lignum to you, and I am\nsure you'll bring him through it.\"\n\nThe trooper returns that this is kindly said and that he WILL bring\nLignum through it somehow. Upon which Mrs. Bagnet, with her cloak,\nbasket, and umbrella, goes home, bright-eyed again, to the rest of\nher family, and the comrades sally forth on the hopeful errand of\nmollifying Mr. Smallweed.\n\nWhether there are two people in England less likely to come\nsatisfactorily out of any negotiation with Mr. Smallweed than Mr.\nGeorge and Mr. Matthew Bagnet may be very reasonably questioned.\nAlso, notwithstanding their martial appearance, broad square\nshoulders, and heavy tread, whether there are within the same limits\ntwo more simple and unaccustomed children in all the Smallweedy\naffairs of life. As they proceed with great gravity through the\nstreets towards the region of Mount Pleasant, Mr. Bagnet, observing\nhis companion to be thoughtful, considers it a friendly part to refer\nto Mrs. Bagnet's late sally.\n\n\"George, you know the old girl--she's as sweet and as mild as milk.\nBut touch her on the children--or myself--and she's off like\ngunpowder.\"\n\n\"It does her credit, Mat!\"\n\n\"George,\" says Mr. Bagnet, looking straight before him, \"the old\ngirl--can't do anything--that don't do her credit. More or less. I\nnever say so. Discipline must be maintained.\"\n\n\"She's worth her weight in gold,\" says the trooper.\n\n\"In gold?\" says Mr. Bagnet. \"I'll tell you what. The old girl's\nweight--is twelve stone six. Would I take that weight--in any\nmetal--for the old girl? No. Why not? Because the old girl's metal is\nfar more precious--than the preciousest metal. And she's ALL metal!\"\n\n\"You are right, Mat!\"\n\n\"When she took me--and accepted of the ring--she 'listed under me and\nthe children--heart and head, for life. She's that earnest,\" says Mr.\nBagnet, \"and true to her colours--that, touch us with a finger--and\nshe turns out--and stands to her arms. If the old girl fires\nwide--once in a way--at the call of duty--look over it, George. For\nshe's loyal!\"\n\n\"Why, bless her, Mat,\" returns the trooper, \"I think the higher of\nher for it!\"\n\n\"You are right!\" says Mr. Bagnet with the warmest enthusiasm, though\nwithout relaxing the rigidity of a single muscle. \"Think as high of\nthe old girl--as the rock of Gibraltar--and still you'll be thinking\nlow--of such merits. But I never own to it before her. Discipline\nmust be maintained.\"\n\nThese encomiums bring them to Mount Pleasant and to Grandfather\nSmallweed's house. The door is opened by the perennial Judy, who,\nhaving surveyed them from top to toe with no particular favour, but\nindeed with a malignant sneer, leaves them standing there while she\nconsults the oracle as to their admission. The oracle may be inferred\nto give consent from the circumstance of her returning with the words\non her honey lips that they can come in if they want to it. Thus\nprivileged, they come in and find Mr. Smallweed with his feet in the\ndrawer of his chair as if it were a paper foot-bath and Mrs.\nSmallweed obscured with the cushion like a bird that is not to sing.\n\n\"My dear friend,\" says Grandfather Smallweed with those two lean\naffectionate arms of his stretched forth. \"How de do? How de do? Who\nis our friend, my dear friend?\"\n\n\"Why this,\" returns George, not able to be very conciliatory at\nfirst, \"is Matthew Bagnet, who has obliged me in that matter of ours,\nyou know.\"\n\n\"Oh! Mr. Bagnet? Surely!\" The old man looks at him under his hand.\n\n\"Hope you're well, Mr. Bagnet? Fine man, Mr. George! Military air,\nsir!\"\n\nNo chairs being offered, Mr. George brings one forward for Bagnet and\none for himself. They sit down, Mr. Bagnet as if he had no power of\nbending himself, except at the hips, for that purpose.\n\n\"Judy,\" says Mr. Smallweed, \"bring the pipe.\"\n\n\"Why, I don't know,\" Mr. George interposes, \"that the young woman\nneed give herself that trouble, for to tell you the truth, I am not\ninclined to smoke it to-day.\"\n\n\"Ain't you?\" returns the old man. \"Judy, bring the pipe.\"\n\n\"The fact is, Mr. Smallweed,\" proceeds George, \"that I find myself in\nrather an unpleasant state of mind. It appears to me, sir, that your\nfriend in the city has been playing tricks.\"\n\n\"Oh, dear no!\" says Grandfather Smallweed. \"He never does that!\"\n\n\"Don't he? Well, I am glad to hear it, because I thought it might be\nHIS doing. This, you know, I am speaking of. This letter.\"\n\nGrandfather Smallweed smiles in a very ugly way in recognition of the\nletter.\n\n\"What does it mean?\" asks Mr. George.\n\n\"Judy,\" says the old man. \"Have you got the pipe? Give it to me. Did\nyou say what does it mean, my good friend?\"\n\n\"Aye! Now, come, come, you know, Mr. Smallweed,\" urges the trooper,\nconstraining himself to speak as smoothly and confidentially as he\ncan, holding the open letter in one hand and resting the broad\nknuckles of the other on his thigh, \"a good lot of money has passed\nbetween us, and we are face to face at the present moment, and are\nboth well aware of the understanding there has always been. I am\nprepared to do the usual thing which I have done regularly and to\nkeep this matter going. I never got a letter like this from you\nbefore, and I have been a little put about by it this morning,\nbecause here's my friend Matthew Bagnet, who, you know, had none of\nthe money--\"\n\n\"I DON'T know it, you know,\" says the old man quietly.\n\n\"Why, con-found you--it, I mean--I tell you so, don't I?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, you tell me so,\" returns Grandfather Smallweed. \"But I\ndon't know it.\"\n\n\"Well!\" says the trooper, swallowing his fire. \"I know it.\"\n\nMr. Smallweed replies with excellent temper, \"Ah! That's quite\nanother thing!\" And adds, \"But it don't matter. Mr. Bagnet's\nsituation is all one, whether or no.\"\n\nThe unfortunate George makes a great effort to arrange the affair\ncomfortably and to propitiate Mr. Smallweed by taking him upon his\nown terms.\n\n\"That's just what I mean. As you say, Mr. Smallweed, here's Matthew\nBagnet liable to be fixed whether or no. Now, you see, that makes his\ngood lady very uneasy in her mind, and me too, for whereas I'm a\nharum-scarum sort of a good-for-nought that more kicks than halfpence\ncome natural to, why he's a steady family man, don't you see? Now,\nMr. Smallweed,\" says the trooper, gaining confidence as he proceeds\nin his soldierly mode of doing business, \"although you and I are good\nfriends enough in a certain sort of a way, I am well aware that I\ncan't ask you to let my friend Bagnet off entirely.\"\n\n\"Oh, dear, you are too modest. You can ASK me anything, Mr. George.\"\n(There is an ogreish kind of jocularity in Grandfather Smallweed\nto-day.)\n\n\"And you can refuse, you mean, eh? Or not you so much, perhaps, as\nyour friend in the city? Ha ha ha!\"\n\n\"Ha ha ha!\" echoes Grandfather Smallweed. In such a very hard manner\nand with eyes so particularly green that Mr. Bagnet's natural gravity\nis much deepened by the contemplation of that venerable man.\n\n\"Come!\" says the sanguine George. \"I am glad to find we can be\npleasant, because I want to arrange this pleasantly. Here's my friend\nBagnet, and here am I. We'll settle the matter on the spot, if you\nplease, Mr. Smallweed, in the usual way. And you'll ease my friend\nBagnet's mind, and his family's mind, a good deal if you'll just\nmention to him what our understanding is.\"\n\nHere some shrill spectre cries out in a mocking manner, \"Oh, good\ngracious! Oh!\" Unless, indeed, it be the sportive Judy, who is found\nto be silent when the startled visitors look round, but whose chin\nhas received a recent toss, expressive of derision and contempt. Mr.\nBagnet's gravity becomes yet more profound.\n\n\"But I think you asked me, Mr. George\"--old Smallweed, who all this\ntime has had the pipe in his hand, is the speaker now--\"I think you\nasked me, what did the letter mean?\"\n\n\"Why, yes, I did,\" returns the trooper in his off-hand way, \"but I\ndon't care to know particularly, if it's all correct and pleasant.\"\n\nMr. Smallweed, purposely balking himself in an aim at the trooper's\nhead, throws the pipe on the ground and breaks it to pieces.\n\n\"That's what it means, my dear friend. I'll smash you. I'll crumble\nyou. I'll powder you. Go to the devil!\"\n\nThe two friends rise and look at one another. Mr. Bagnet's gravity\nhas now attained its profoundest point.\n\n\"Go to the devil!\" repeats the old man. \"I'll have no more of your\npipe-smokings and swaggerings. What? You're an independent dragoon,\ntoo! Go to my lawyer (you remember where; you have been there before)\nand show your independence now, will you? Come, my dear friend,\nthere's a chance for you. Open the street door, Judy; put these\nblusterers out! Call in help if they don't go. Put 'em out!\"\n\nHe vociferates this so loudly that Mr. Bagnet, laying his hands on\nthe shoulders of his comrade before the latter can recover from his\namazement, gets him on the outside of the street door, which is\ninstantly slammed by the triumphant Judy. Utterly confounded, Mr.\nGeorge awhile stands looking at the knocker. Mr. Bagnet, in a perfect\nabyss of gravity, walks up and down before the little parlour window\nlike a sentry and looks in every time he passes, apparently revolving\nsomething in his mind.\n\n\"Come, Mat,\" says Mr. George when he has recovered himself, \"we must\ntry the lawyer. Now, what do you think of this rascal?\"\n\nMr. Bagnet, stopping to take a farewell look into the parlour,\nreplies with one shake of his head directed at the interior, \"If my\nold girl had been here--I'd have told him!\" Having so discharged\nhimself of the subject of his cogitations, he falls into step and\nmarches off with the trooper, shoulder to shoulder.\n\nWhen they present themselves in Lincoln's Inn Fields, Mr. Tulkinghorn\nis engaged and not to be seen. He is not at all willing to see them,\nfor when they have waited a full hour, and the clerk, on his bell\nbeing rung, takes the opportunity of mentioning as much, he brings\nforth no more encouraging message than that Mr. Tulkinghorn has\nnothing to say to them and they had better not wait. They do wait,\nhowever, with the perseverance of military tactics, and at last the\nbell rings again and the client in possession comes out of Mr.\nTulkinghorn's room.\n\nThe client is a handsome old lady, no other than Mrs. Rouncewell,\nhousekeeper at Chesney Wold. She comes out of the sanctuary with a\nfair old-fashioned curtsy and softly shuts the door. She is treated\nwith some distinction there, for the clerk steps out of his pew to\nshow her through the outer office and to let her out. The old lady is\nthanking him for his attention when she observes the comrades in\nwaiting.\n\n\"I beg your pardon, sir, but I think those gentlemen are military?\"\n\nThe clerk referring the question to them with his eye, and Mr. George\nnot turning round from the almanac over the fire-place. Mr. Bagnet\ntakes upon himself to reply, \"Yes, ma'am. Formerly.\"\n\n\"I thought so. I was sure of it. My heart warms, gentlemen, at the\nsight of you. It always does at the sight of such. God bless you,\ngentlemen! You'll excuse an old woman, but I had a son once who went\nfor a soldier. A fine handsome youth he was, and good in his bold\nway, though some people did disparage him to his poor mother. I ask\nyour pardon for troubling you, sir. God bless you, gentlemen!\"\n\n\"Same to you, ma'am!\" returns Mr. Bagnet with right good will.\n\nThere is something very touching in the earnestness of the old lady's\nvoice and in the tremble that goes through her quaint old figure. But\nMr. George is so occupied with the almanac over the fire-place\n(calculating the coming months by it perhaps) that he does not look\nround until she has gone away and the door is closed upon her.\n\n\"George,\" Mr. Bagnet gruffly whispers when he does turn from the\nalmanac at last. \"Don't be cast down! 'Why, soldiers, why--should we\nbe melancholy, boys?' Cheer up, my hearty!\"\n\nThe clerk having now again gone in to say that they are still there\nand Mr. Tulkinghorn being heard to return with some irascibility,\n\"Let 'em come in then!\" they pass into the great room with the\npainted ceiling and find him standing before the fire.\n\n\"Now, you men, what do you want? Sergeant, I told you the last time I\nsaw you that I don't desire your company here.\"\n\nSergeant replies--dashed within the last few minutes as to his usual\nmanner of speech, and even as to his usual carriage--that he has\nreceived this letter, has been to Mr. Smallweed about it, and has\nbeen referred there.\n\n\"I have nothing to say to you,\" rejoins Mr. Tulkinghorn. \"If you get\ninto debt, you must pay your debts or take the consequences. You have\nno occasion to come here to learn that, I suppose?\"\n\nSergeant is sorry to say that he is not prepared with the money.\n\n\"Very well! Then the other man--this man, if this is he--must pay it\nfor you.\"\n\nSergeant is sorry to add that the other man is not prepared with the\nmoney either.\n\n\"Very well! Then you must pay it between you or you must both be sued\nfor it and both suffer. You have had the money and must refund it.\nYou are not to pocket other people's pounds, shillings, and pence and\nescape scot-free.\"\n\nThe lawyer sits down in his easy-chair and stirs the fire. Mr. George\nhopes he will have the goodness to--\"I tell you, sergeant, I have\nnothing to say to you. I don't like your associates and don't want\nyou here. This matter is not at all in my course of practice and is\nnot in my office. Mr. Smallweed is good enough to offer these affairs\nto me, but they are not in my way. You must go to Melchisedech's in\nClifford's Inn.\"\n\n\"I must make an apology to you, sir,\" says Mr. George, \"for pressing\nmyself upon you with so little encouragement--which is almost as\nunpleasant to me as it can be to you--but would you let me say a\nprivate word to you?\"\n\nMr. Tulkinghorn rises with his hands in his pockets and walks into\none of the window recesses. \"Now! I have no time to waste.\" In the\nmidst of his perfect assumption of indifference, he directs a sharp\nlook at the trooper, taking care to stand with his own back to the\nlight and to have the other with his face towards it.\n\n\"Well, sir,\" says Mr. George, \"this man with me is the other party\nimplicated in this unfortunate affair--nominally, only nominally--and\nmy sole object is to prevent his getting into trouble on my account.\nHe is a most respectable man with a wife and family, formerly in the\nRoyal Artillery--\"\n\n\"My friend, I don't care a pinch of snuff for the whole Royal\nArtillery establishment--officers, men, tumbrils, waggons, horses,\nguns, and ammunition.\"\n\n\"'Tis likely, sir. But I care a good deal for Bagnet and his wife and\nfamily being injured on my account. And if I could bring them through\nthis matter, I should have no help for it but to give up without any\nother consideration what you wanted of me the other day.\"\n\n\"Have you got it here?\"\n\n\"I have got it here, sir.\"\n\n\"Sergeant,\" the lawyer proceeds in his dry passionless manner, far\nmore hopeless in the dealing with than any amount of vehemence, \"make\nup your mind while I speak to you, for this is final. After I have\nfinished speaking I have closed the subject, and I won't re-open it.\nUnderstand that. You can leave here, for a few days, what you say you\nhave brought here if you choose; you can take it away at once if you\nchoose. In case you choose to leave it here, I can do this for you--I\ncan replace this matter on its old footing, and I can go so far\nbesides as to give you a written undertaking that this man Bagnet\nshall never be troubled in any way until you have been proceeded\nagainst to the utmost, that your means shall be exhausted before the\ncreditor looks to his. This is in fact all but freeing him. Have you\ndecided?\"\n\nThe trooper puts his hand into his breast and answers with a long\nbreath, \"I must do it, sir.\"\n\nSo Mr. Tulkinghorn, putting on his spectacles, sits down and writes\nthe undertaking, which he slowly reads and explains to Bagnet, who\nhas all this time been staring at the ceiling and who puts his hand\non his bald head again, under this new verbal shower-bath, and seems\nexceedingly in need of the old girl through whom to express his\nsentiments. The trooper then takes from his breast-pocket a folded\npaper, which he lays with an unwilling hand at the lawyer's elbow.\n\"'Tis only a letter of instructions, sir. The last I ever had from\nhim.\"\n\nLook at a millstone, Mr. George, for some change in its expression,\nand you will find it quite as soon as in the face of Mr. Tulkinghorn\nwhen he opens and reads the letter! He refolds it and lays it in his\ndesk with a countenance as unperturbable as death.\n\nNor has he anything more to say or do but to nod once in the same\nfrigid and discourteous manner and to say briefly, \"You can go. Show\nthese men out, there!\" Being shown out, they repair to Mr. Bagnet's\nresidence to dine.\n\nBoiled beef and greens constitute the day's variety on the former\nrepast of boiled pork and greens, and Mrs. Bagnet serves out the meal\nin the same way and seasons it with the best of temper, being that\nrare sort of old girl that she receives Good to her arms without a\nhint that it might be Better and catches light from any little spot\nof darkness near her. The spot on this occasion is the darkened brow\nof Mr. George; he is unusually thoughtful and depressed. At first\nMrs. Bagnet trusts to the combined endearments of Quebec and Malta to\nrestore him, but finding those young ladies sensible that their\nexisting Bluffy is not the Bluffy of their usual frolicsome\nacquaintance, she winks off the light infantry and leaves him to\ndeploy at leisure on the open ground of the domestic hearth.\n\nBut he does not. He remains in close order, clouded and depressed.\nDuring the lengthy cleaning up and pattening process, when he and Mr.\nBagnet are supplied with their pipes, he is no better than he was at\ndinner. He forgets to smoke, looks at the fire and ponders, lets his\npipe out, fills the breast of Mr. Bagnet with perturbation and dismay\nby showing that he has no enjoyment of tobacco.\n\nTherefore when Mrs. Bagnet at last appears, rosy from the\ninvigorating pail, and sits down to her work, Mr. Bagnet growls, \"Old\ngirl!\" and winks monitions to her to find out what's the matter.\n\n\"Why, George!\" says Mrs. Bagnet, quietly threading her needle. \"How\nlow you are!\"\n\n\"Am I? Not good company? Well, I am afraid I am not.\"\n\n\"He ain't at all like Bluffy, mother!\" cries little Malta.\n\n\"Because he ain't well, I think, mother,\" adds Quebec.\n\n\"Sure that's a bad sign not to be like Bluffy, too!\" returns the\ntrooper, kissing the young damsels. \"But it's true,\" with a sigh,\n\"true, I am afraid. These little ones are always right!\"\n\n\"George,\" says Mrs. Bagnet, working busily, \"if I thought you cross\nenough to think of anything that a shrill old soldier's wife--who\ncould have bitten her tongue off afterwards and ought to have done it\nalmost--said this morning, I don't know what I shouldn't say to you\nnow.\"\n\n\"My kind soul of a darling,\" returns the trooper. \"Not a morsel of\nit.\"\n\n\"Because really and truly, George, what I said and meant to say was\nthat I trusted Lignum to you and was sure you'd bring him through it.\nAnd you HAVE brought him through it, noble!\"\n\n\"Thankee, my dear!\" says George. \"I am glad of your good opinion.\"\n\nIn giving Mrs. Bagnet's hand, with her work in it, a friendly\nshake--for she took her seat beside him--the trooper's attention is\nattracted to her face. After looking at it for a little while as she\nplies her needle, he looks to young Woolwich, sitting on his stool in\nthe corner, and beckons that fifer to him.\n\n\"See there, my boy,\" says George, very gently smoothing the mother's\nhair with his hand, \"there's a good loving forehead for you! All\nbright with love of you, my boy. A little touched by the sun and the\nweather through following your father about and taking care of you,\nbut as fresh and wholesome as a ripe apple on a tree.\"\n\nMr. Bagnet's face expresses, so far as in its wooden material lies,\nthe highest approbation and acquiescence.\n\n\"The time will come, my boy,\" pursues the trooper, \"when this hair of\nyour mother's will be grey, and this forehead all crossed and\nre-crossed with wrinkles, and a fine old lady she'll be then. Take\ncare, while you are young, that you can think in those days, 'I never\nwhitened a hair of her dear head--I never marked a sorrowful line in\nher face!' For of all the many things that you can think of when you\nare a man, you had better have THAT by you, Woolwich!\"\n\nMr. George concludes by rising from his chair, seating the boy beside\nhis mother in it, and saying, with something of a hurry about him,\nthat he'll smoke his pipe in the street a bit.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXV\n\nEsther's Narrative\n\n\nI lay ill through several weeks, and the usual tenor of my life\nbecame like an old remembrance. But this was not the effect of time\nso much as of the change in all my habits made by the helplessness\nand inaction of a sick-room. Before I had been confined to it many\ndays, everything else seemed to have retired into a remote distance\nwhere there was little or no separation between the various stages of\nmy life which had been really divided by years. In falling ill, I\nseemed to have crossed a dark lake and to have left all my\nexperiences, mingled together by the great distance, on the healthy\nshore.\n\nMy housekeeping duties, though at first it caused me great anxiety to\nthink that they were unperformed, were soon as far off as the oldest\nof the old duties at Greenleaf or the summer afternoons when I went\nhome from school with my portfolio under my arm, and my childish\nshadow at my side, to my godmother's house. I had never known before\nhow short life really was and into how small a space the mind could\nput it.\n\nWhile I was very ill, the way in which these divisions of time became\nconfused with one another distressed my mind exceedingly. At once a\nchild, an elder girl, and the little woman I had been so happy as, I\nwas not only oppressed by cares and difficulties adapted to each\nstation, but by the great perplexity of endlessly trying to reconcile\nthem. I suppose that few who have not been in such a condition can\nquite understand what I mean or what painful unrest arose from this\nsource.\n\nFor the same reason I am almost afraid to hint at that time in my\ndisorder--it seemed one long night, but I believe there were both\nnights and days in it--when I laboured up colossal staircases, ever\nstriving to reach the top, and ever turned, as I have seen a worm in\na garden path, by some obstruction, and labouring again. I knew\nperfectly at intervals, and I think vaguely at most times, that I was\nin my bed; and I talked with Charley, and felt her touch, and knew\nher very well; yet I would find myself complaining, \"Oh, more of\nthese never-ending stairs, Charley--more and more--piled up to the\nsky', I think!\" and labouring on again.\n\nDare I hint at that worse time when, strung together somewhere in\ngreat black space, there was a flaming necklace, or ring, or starry\ncircle of some kind, of which I was one of the beads! And when my\nonly prayer was to be taken off from the rest and when it was such\ninexplicable agony and misery to be a part of the dreadful thing?\n\nPerhaps the less I say of these sick experiences, the less tedious\nand the more intelligible I shall be. I do not recall them to make\nothers unhappy or because I am now the least unhappy in remembering\nthem. It may be that if we knew more of such strange afflictions we\nmight be the better able to alleviate their intensity.\n\nThe repose that succeeded, the long delicious sleep, the blissful\nrest, when in my weakness I was too calm to have any care for myself\nand could have heard (or so I think now) that I was dying, with no\nother emotion than with a pitying love for those I left behind--this\nstate can be perhaps more widely understood. I was in this state when\nI first shrunk from the light as it twinkled on me once more, and\nknew with a boundless joy for which no words are rapturous enough\nthat I should see again.\n\nI had heard my Ada crying at the door, day and night; I had heard her\ncalling to me that I was cruel and did not love her; I had heard her\npraying and imploring to be let in to nurse and comfort me and to\nleave my bedside no more; but I had only said, when I could speak,\n\"Never, my sweet girl, never!\" and I had over and over again reminded\nCharley that she was to keep my darling from the room whether I lived\nor died. Charley had been true to me in that time of need, and with\nher little hand and her great heart had kept the door fast.\n\nBut now, my sight strengthening and the glorious light coming every\nday more fully and brightly on me, I could read the letters that my\ndear wrote to me every morning and evening and could put them to my\nlips and lay my cheek upon them with no fear of hurting her. I could\nsee my little maid, so tender and so careful, going about the two\nrooms setting everything in order and speaking cheerfully to Ada from\nthe open window again. I could understand the stillness in the house\nand the thoughtfulness it expressed on the part of all those who had\nalways been so good to me. I could weep in the exquisite felicity of\nmy heart and be as happy in my weakness as ever I had been in my\nstrength.\n\nBy and by my strength began to be restored. Instead of lying, with so\nstrange a calmness, watching what was done for me, as if it were done\nfor some one else whom I was quietly sorry for, I helped it a little,\nand so on to a little more and much more, until I became useful to\nmyself, and interested, and attached to life again.\n\nHow well I remember the pleasant afternoon when I was raised in bed\nwith pillows for the first time to enjoy a great tea-drinking with\nCharley! The little creature--sent into the world, surely, to\nminister to the weak and sick--was so happy, and so busy, and stopped\nso often in her preparations to lay her head upon my bosom, and\nfondle me, and cry with joyful tears she was so glad, she was so\nglad, that I was obliged to say, \"Charley, if you go on in this way,\nI must lie down again, my darling, for I am weaker than I thought I\nwas!\" So Charley became as quiet as a mouse and took her bright face\nhere and there across and across the two rooms, out of the shade into\nthe divine sunshine, and out of the sunshine into the shade, while I\nwatched her peacefully. When all her preparations were concluded and\nthe pretty tea-table with its little delicacies to tempt me, and its\nwhite cloth, and its flowers, and everything so lovingly and\nbeautifully arranged for me by Ada downstairs, was ready at the\nbedside, I felt sure I was steady enough to say something to Charley\nthat was not new to my thoughts.\n\nFirst I complimented Charley on the room, and indeed it was so fresh\nand airy, so spotless and neat, that I could scarce believe I had\nbeen lying there so long. This delighted Charley, and her face was\nbrighter than before.\n\n\"Yet, Charley,\" said I, looking round, \"I miss something, surely,\nthat I am accustomed to?\"\n\nPoor little Charley looked round too and pretended to shake her head\nas if there were nothing absent.\n\n\"Are the pictures all as they used to be?\" I asked her.\n\n\"Every one of them, miss,\" said Charley.\n\n\"And the furniture, Charley?\"\n\n\"Except where I have moved it about to make more room, miss.\"\n\n\"And yet,\" said I, \"I miss some familiar object. Ah, I know what it\nis, Charley! It's the looking-glass.\"\n\nCharley got up from the table, making as if she had forgotten\nsomething, and went into the next room; and I heard her sob there.\n\nI had thought of this very often. I was now certain of it. I could\nthank God that it was not a shock to me now. I called Charley back,\nand when she came--at first pretending to smile, but as she drew\nnearer to me, looking grieved--I took her in my arms and said, \"It\nmatters very little, Charley. I hope I can do without my old face\nvery well.\"\n\nI was presently so far advanced as to be able to sit up in a great\nchair and even giddily to walk into the adjoining room, leaning on\nCharley. The mirror was gone from its usual place in that room too,\nbut what I had to bear was none the harder to bear for that.\n\nMy guardian had throughout been earnest to visit me, and there was\nnow no good reason why I should deny myself that happiness. He came\none morning, and when he first came in, could only hold me in his\nembrace and say, \"My dear, dear girl!\" I had long known--who could\nknow better?--what a deep fountain of affection and generosity his\nheart was; and was it not worth my trivial suffering and change to\nfill such a place in it? \"Oh, yes!\" I thought. \"He has seen me, and\nhe loves me better than he did; he has seen me and is even fonder of\nme than he was before; and what have I to mourn for!\"\n\nHe sat down by me on the sofa, supporting me with his arm. For a\nlittle while he sat with his hand over his face, but when he removed\nit, fell into his usual manner. There never can have been, there\nnever can be, a pleasanter manner.\n\n\"My little woman,\" said he, \"what a sad time this has been. Such an\ninflexible little woman, too, through all!\"\n\n\"Only for the best, guardian,\" said I.\n\n\"For the best?\" he repeated tenderly. \"Of course, for the best. But\nhere have Ada and I been perfectly forlorn and miserable; here has\nyour friend Caddy been coming and going late and early; here has\nevery one about the house been utterly lost and dejected; here has\neven poor Rick been writing--to ME too--in his anxiety for you!\"\n\nI had read of Caddy in Ada's letters, but not of Richard. I told him\nso.\n\n\"Why, no, my dear,\" he replied. \"I have thought it better not to\nmention it to her.\"\n\n\"And you speak of his writing to YOU,\" said I, repeating his\nemphasis. \"As if it were not natural for him to do so, guardian; as\nif he could write to a better friend!\"\n\n\"He thinks he could, my love,\" returned my guardian, \"and to many a\nbetter. The truth is, he wrote to me under a sort of protest while\nunable to write to you with any hope of an answer--wrote coldly,\nhaughtily, distantly, resentfully. Well, dearest little woman, we\nmust look forbearingly on it. He is not to blame. Jarndyce and\nJarndyce has warped him out of himself and perverted me in his eyes.\nI have known it do as bad deeds, and worse, many a time. If two\nangels could be concerned in it, I believe it would change their\nnature.\"\n\n\"It has not changed yours, guardian.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, it has, my dear,\" he said laughingly. \"It has made the\nsouth wind easterly, I don't know how often. Rick mistrusts and\nsuspects me--goes to lawyers, and is taught to mistrust and suspect\nme. Hears I have conflicting interests, claims clashing against his\nand what not. Whereas, heaven knows that if I could get out of the\nmountains of wiglomeration on which my unfortunate name has been so\nlong bestowed (which I can't) or could level them by the extinction\nof my own original right (which I can't either, and no human power\never can, anyhow, I believe, to such a pass have we got), I would do\nit this hour. I would rather restore to poor Rick his proper nature\nthan be endowed with all the money that dead suitors, broken, heart\nand soul, upon the wheel of Chancery, have left unclaimed with the\nAccountant-General--and that's money enough, my dear, to be cast into\na pyramid, in memory of Chancery's transcendent wickedness.\"\n\n\"IS it possible, guardian,\" I asked, amazed, \"that Richard can be\nsuspicious of you?\"\n\n\"Ah, my love, my love,\" he said, \"it is in the subtle poison of such\nabuses to breed such diseases. His blood is infected, and objects\nlose their natural aspects in his sight. It is not HIS fault.\"\n\n\"But it is a terrible misfortune, guardian.\"\n\n\"It is a terrible misfortune, little woman, to be ever drawn within\nthe influences of Jarndyce and Jarndyce. I know none greater. By\nlittle and little he has been induced to trust in that rotten reed,\nand it communicates some portion of its rottenness to everything\naround him. But again I say with all my soul, we must be patient with\npoor Rick and not blame him. What a troop of fine fresh hearts like\nhis have I seen in my time turned by the same means!\"\n\nI could not help expressing something of my wonder and regret that\nhis benevolent, disinterested intentions had prospered so little.\n\n\"We must not say so, Dame Durden,\" he cheerfully replied; \"Ada is the\nhappier, I hope, and that is much. I did think that I and both these\nyoung creatures might be friends instead of distrustful foes and that\nwe might so far counter-act the suit and prove too strong for it. But\nit was too much to expect. Jarndyce and Jarndyce was the curtain of\nRick's cradle.\"\n\n\"But, guardian, may we not hope that a little experience will teach\nhim what a false and wretched thing it is?\"\n\n\"We WILL hope so, my Esther,\" said Mr. Jarndyce, \"and that it may not\nteach him so too late. In any case we must not be hard on him. There\nare not many grown and matured men living while we speak, good men\ntoo, who if they were thrown into this same court as suitors would\nnot be vitally changed and depreciated within three years--within\ntwo--within one. How can we stand amazed at poor Rick? A young man so\nunfortunate,\" here he fell into a lower tone, as if he were thinking\naloud, \"cannot at first believe (who could?) that Chancery is what it\nis. He looks to it, flushed and fitfully, to do something with his\ninterests and bring them to some settlement. It procrastinates,\ndisappoints, tries, tortures him; wears out his sanguine hopes and\npatience, thread by thread; but he still looks to it, and hankers\nafter it, and finds his whole world treacherous and hollow. Well,\nwell, well! Enough of this, my dear!\"\n\nHe had supported me, as at first, all this time, and his tenderness\nwas so precious to me that I leaned my head upon his shoulder and\nloved him as if he had been my father. I resolved in my own mind in\nthis little pause, by some means, to see Richard when I grew strong\nand try to set him right.\n\n\"There are better subjects than these,\" said my guardian, \"for such a\njoyful time as the time of our dear girl's recovery. And I had a\ncommission to broach one of them as soon as I should begin to talk.\nWhen shall Ada come to see you, my love?\"\n\nI had been thinking of that too. A little in connexion with the\nabsent mirrors, but not much, for I knew my loving girl would be\nchanged by no change in my looks.\n\n\"Dear guardian,\" said I, \"as I have shut her out so long--though\nindeed, indeed, she is like the light to me--\"\n\n\"I know it well, Dame Durden, well.\"\n\nHe was so good, his touch expressed such endearing compassion and\naffection, and the tone of his voice carried such comfort into my\nheart that I stopped for a little while, quite unable to go on. \"Yes,\nyes, you are tired,\" said he. \"Rest a little.\"\n\n\"As I have kept Ada out so long,\" I began afresh after a short while,\n\"I think I should like to have my own way a little longer, guardian.\nIt would be best to be away from here before I see her. If Charley\nand I were to go to some country lodging as soon as I can move, and\nif I had a week there in which to grow stronger and to be revived by\nthe sweet air and to look forward to the happiness of having Ada with\nme again, I think it would be better for us.\"\n\nI hope it was not a poor thing in me to wish to be a little more used\nto my altered self before I met the eyes of the dear girl I longed so\nardently to see, but it is the truth. I did. He understood me, I was\nsure; but I was not afraid of that. If it were a poor thing, I knew\nhe would pass it over.\n\n\"Our spoilt little woman,\" said my guardian, \"shall have her own way\neven in her inflexibility, though at the price, I know, of tears\ndownstairs. And see here! Here is Boythorn, heart of chivalry,\nbreathing such ferocious vows as never were breathed on paper before,\nthat if you don't go and occupy his whole house, he having already\nturned out of it expressly for that purpose, by heaven and by earth\nhe'll pull it down and not leave one brick standing on another!\"\n\nAnd my guardian put a letter in my hand, without any ordinary\nbeginning such as \"My dear Jarndyce,\" but rushing at once into the\nwords, \"I swear if Miss Summerson do not come down and take\npossession of my house, which I vacate for her this day at one\no'clock, P.M.,\" and then with the utmost seriousness, and in the most\nemphatic terms, going on to make the extraordinary declaration he had\nquoted. We did not appreciate the writer the less for laughing\nheartily over it, and we settled that I should send him a letter of\nthanks on the morrow and accept his offer. It was a most agreeable\none to me, for all the places I could have thought of, I should have\nliked to go to none so well as Chesney Wold.\n\n\"Now, little housewife,\" said my guardian, looking at his watch, \"I\nwas strictly timed before I came upstairs, for you must not be tired\ntoo soon; and my time has waned away to the last minute. I have one\nother petition. Little Miss Flite, hearing a rumour that you were\nill, made nothing of walking down here--twenty miles, poor soul, in a\npair of dancing shoes--to inquire. It was heaven's mercy we were at\nhome, or she would have walked back again.\"\n\nThe old conspiracy to make me happy! Everybody seemed to be in it!\n\n\"Now, pet,\" said my guardian, \"if it would not be irksome to you to\nadmit the harmless little creature one afternoon before you save\nBoythorn's otherwise devoted house from demolition, I believe you\nwould make her prouder and better pleased with herself than I--though\nmy eminent name is Jarndyce--could do in a lifetime.\"\n\nI have no doubt he knew there would be something in the simple image\nof the poor afflicted creature that would fall like a gentle lesson\non my mind at that time. I felt it as he spoke to me. I could not\ntell him heartily enough how ready I was to receive her. I had always\npitied her, never so much as now. I had always been glad of my little\npower to soothe her under her calamity, but never, never, half so\nglad before.\n\nWe arranged a time for Miss Flite to come out by the coach and share\nmy early dinner. When my guardian left me, I turned my face away upon\nmy couch and prayed to be forgiven if I, surrounded by such\nblessings, had magnified to myself the little trial that I had to\nundergo. The childish prayer of that old birthday when I had aspired\nto be industrious, contented, and true-hearted and to do good to some\none and win some love to myself if I could came back into my mind\nwith a reproachful sense of all the happiness I had since enjoyed and\nall the affectionate hearts that had been turned towards me. If I\nwere weak now, what had I profited by those mercies? I repeated the\nold childish prayer in its old childish words and found that its old\npeace had not departed from it.\n\nMy guardian now came every day. In a week or so more I could walk\nabout our rooms and hold long talks with Ada from behind the\nwindow-curtain. Yet I never saw her, for I had not as yet the courage\nto look at the dear face, though I could have done so easily without\nher seeing me.\n\nOn the appointed day Miss Flite arrived. The poor little creature ran\ninto my room quite forgetful of her usual dignity, and crying from\nher very heart of hearts, \"My dear Fitz Jarndyce!\" fell upon my neck\nand kissed me twenty times.\n\n\"Dear me!\" said she, putting her hand into her reticule, \"I have\nnothing here but documents, my dear Fitz Jarndyce; I must borrow a\npocket handkerchief.\"\n\nCharley gave her one, and the good creature certainly made use of it,\nfor she held it to her eyes with both hands and sat so, shedding\ntears for the next ten minutes.\n\n\"With pleasure, my dear Fitz Jarndyce,\" she was careful to explain.\n\"Not the least pain. Pleasure to see you well again. Pleasure at\nhaving the honour of being admitted to see you. I am so much fonder\nof you, my love, than of the Chancellor. Though I DO attend court\nregularly. By the by, my dear, mentioning pocket handkerchiefs--\"\n\nMiss Flite here looked at Charley, who had been to meet her at the\nplace where the coach stopped. Charley glanced at me and looked\nunwilling to pursue the suggestion.\n\n\"Ve-ry right!\" said Miss Flite, \"Ve-ry correct. Truly! Highly\nindiscreet of me to mention it; but my dear Miss Fitz Jarndyce, I am\nafraid I am at times (between ourselves, you wouldn't think it) a\nlittle--rambling you know,\" said Miss Flite, touching her forehead.\n\"Nothing more.\"\n\n\"What were you going to tell me?\" said I, smiling, for I saw she\nwanted to go on. \"You have roused my curiosity, and now you must\ngratify it.\"\n\nMiss Flite looked at Charley for advice in this important crisis, who\nsaid, \"If you please, ma'am, you had better tell then,\" and therein\ngratified Miss Flite beyond measure.\n\n\"So sagacious, our young friend,\" said she to me in her mysterious\nway. \"Diminutive. But ve-ry sagacious! Well, my dear, it's a pretty\nanecdote. Nothing more. Still I think it charming. Who should follow\nus down the road from the coach, my dear, but a poor person in a very\nungenteel bonnet--\"\n\n\"Jenny, if you please, miss,\" said Charley.\n\n\"Just so!\" Miss Flite acquiesced with the greatest suavity. \"Jenny.\nYe-es! And what does she tell our young friend but that there has\nbeen a lady with a veil inquiring at her cottage after my dear Fitz\nJarndyce's health and taking a handkerchief away with her as a little\nkeepsake merely because it was my amiable Fitz Jarndyce's! Now, you\nknow, so very prepossessing in the lady with the veil!\"\n\n\"If you please, miss,\" said Charley, to whom I looked in some\nastonishment, \"Jenny says that when her baby died, you left a\nhandkerchief there, and that she put it away and kept it with the\nbaby's little things. I think, if you please, partly because it was\nyours, miss, and partly because it had covered the baby.\"\n\n\"Diminutive,\" whispered Miss Flite, making a variety of motions about\nher own forehead to express intellect in Charley. \"But exceedingly\nsagacious! And so dear! My love, she's clearer than any counsel I\never heard!\"\n\n\"Yes, Charley,\" I returned. \"I remember it. Well?\"\n\n\"Well, miss,\" said Charley, \"and that's the handkerchief the lady\ntook. And Jenny wants you to know that she wouldn't have made away\nwith it herself for a heap of money but that the lady took it and\nleft some money instead. Jenny don't know her at all, if you please,\nmiss!\"\n\n\"Why, who can she be?\" said I.\n\n\"My love,\" Miss Flite suggested, advancing her lips to my ear with\nher most mysterious look, \"in MY opinion--don't mention this to our\ndiminutive friend--she's the Lord Chancellor's wife. He's married,\nyou know. And I understand she leads him a terrible life. Throws his\nlordship's papers into the fire, my dear, if he won't pay the\njeweller!\"\n\nI did not think very much about this lady then, for I had an\nimpression that it might be Caddy. Besides, my attention was diverted\nby my visitor, who was cold after her ride and looked hungry and who,\nour dinner being brought in, required some little assistance in\narraying herself with great satisfaction in a pitiable old scarf and\na much-worn and often-mended pair of gloves, which she had brought\ndown in a paper parcel. I had to preside, too, over the\nentertainment, consisting of a dish of fish, a roast fowl, a\nsweetbread, vegetables, pudding, and Madeira; and it was so pleasant\nto see how she enjoyed it, and with what state and ceremony she did\nhonour to it, that I was soon thinking of nothing else.\n\nWhen we had finished and had our little dessert before us,\nembellished by the hands of my dear, who would yield the\nsuperintendence of everything prepared for me to no one, Miss Flite\nwas so very chatty and happy that I thought I would lead her to her\nown history, as she was always pleased to talk about herself. I began\nby saying \"You have attended on the Lord Chancellor many years, Miss\nFlite?\"\n\n\"Oh, many, many, many years, my dear. But I expect a judgment.\nShortly.\"\n\nThere was an anxiety even in her hopefulness that made me doubtful if\nI had done right in approaching the subject. I thought I would say no\nmore about it.\n\n\"My father expected a judgment,\" said Miss Flite. \"My brother. My\nsister. They all expected a judgment. The same that I expect.\"\n\n\"They are all--\"\n\n\"Ye-es. Dead of course, my dear,\" said she.\n\nAs I saw she would go on, I thought it best to try to be serviceable\nto her by meeting the theme rather than avoiding it.\n\n\"Would it not be wiser,\" said I, \"to expect this judgment no more?\"\n\n\"Why, my dear,\" she answered promptly, \"of course it would!\"\n\n\"And to attend the court no more?\"\n\n\"Equally of course,\" said she. \"Very wearing to be always in\nexpectation of what never comes, my dear Fitz Jarndyce! Wearing, I\nassure you, to the bone!\"\n\nShe slightly showed me her arm, and it was fearfully thin indeed.\n\n\"But, my dear,\" she went on in her mysterious way, \"there's a\ndreadful attraction in the place. Hush! Don't mention it to our\ndiminutive friend when she comes in. Or it may frighten her. With\ngood reason. There's a cruel attraction in the place. You CAN'T leave\nit. And you MUST expect.\"\n\nI tried to assure her that this was not so. She heard me patiently\nand smilingly, but was ready with her own answer.\n\n\"Aye, aye, aye! You think so because I am a little rambling. Ve-ry\nabsurd, to be a little rambling, is it not? Ve-ry confusing, too. To\nthe head. I find it so. But, my dear, I have been there many years,\nand I have noticed. It's the mace and seal upon the table.\"\n\nWhat could they do, did she think? I mildly asked her.\n\n\"Draw,\" returned Miss Flite. \"Draw people on, my dear. Draw peace out\nof them. Sense out of them. Good looks out of them. Good qualities\nout of them. I have felt them even drawing my rest away in the night.\nCold and glittering devils!\"\n\nShe tapped me several times upon the arm and nodded good-humouredly\nas if she were anxious I should understand that I had no cause to\nfear her, though she spoke so gloomily, and confided these awful\nsecrets to me.\n\n\"Let me see,\" said she. \"I'll tell you my own case. Before they ever\ndrew me--before I had ever seen them--what was it I used to do?\nTambourine playing? No. Tambour work. I and my sister worked at\ntambour work. Our father and our brother had a builder's business.\nWe all lived together. Ve-ry respectably, my dear! First, our father\nwas drawn--slowly. Home was drawn with him. In a few years he\nwas a fierce, sour, angry bankrupt without a kind word or a kind\nlook for any one. He had been so different, Fitz Jarndyce. He was\ndrawn to a debtors' prison. There he died. Then our brother was\ndrawn--swiftly--to drunkenness. And rags. And death. Then my sister\nwas drawn. Hush! Never ask to what! Then I was ill and in misery, and\nheard, as I had often heard before, that this was all the work of\nChancery. When I got better, I went to look at the monster. And then\nI found out how it was, and I was drawn to stay there.\"\n\nHaving got over her own short narrative, in the delivery of which she\nhad spoken in a low, strained voice, as if the shock were fresh upon\nher, she gradually resumed her usual air of amiable importance.\n\n\"You don't quite credit me, my dear! Well, well! You will, some day.\nI am a little rambling. But I have noticed. I have seen many new\nfaces come, unsuspicious, within the influence of the mace and seal\nin these many years. As my father's came there. As my brother's. As\nmy sister's. As my own. I hear Conversation Kenge and the rest of\nthem say to the new faces, 'Here's little Miss Flite. Oh, you are new\nhere; and you must come and be presented to little Miss Flite!' Ve-ry\ngood. Proud I am sure to have the honour! And we all laugh. But, Fitz\nJarndyce, I know what will happen. I know, far better than they do,\nwhen the attraction has begun. I know the signs, my dear. I saw them\nbegin in Gridley. And I saw them end. Fitz Jarndyce, my love,\"\nspeaking low again, \"I saw them beginning in our friend the ward in\nJarndyce. Let some one hold him back. Or he'll be drawn to ruin.\"\n\nShe looked at me in silence for some moments, with her face gradually\nsoftening into a smile. Seeming to fear that she had been too gloomy,\nand seeming also to lose the connexion in her mind, she said politely\nas she sipped her glass of wine, \"Yes, my dear, as I was saying, I\nexpect a judgment shortly. Then I shall release my birds, you know,\nand confer estates.\"\n\nI was much impressed by her allusion to Richard and by the sad\nmeaning, so sadly illustrated in her poor pinched form, that made its\nway through all her incoherence. But happily for her, she was quite\ncomplacent again now and beamed with nods and smiles.\n\n\"But, my dear,\" she said, gaily, reaching another hand to put it upon\nmine. \"You have not congratulated me on my physician. Positively not\nonce, yet!\"\n\nI was obliged to confess that I did not quite know what she meant.\n\n\"My physician, Mr. Woodcourt, my dear, who was so exceedingly\nattentive to me. Though his services were rendered quite\ngratuitously. Until the Day of Judgment. I mean THE judgment that\nwill dissolve the spell upon me of the mace and seal.\"\n\n\"Mr. Woodcourt is so far away, now,\" said I, \"that I thought the time\nfor such congratulation was past, Miss Flite.\"\n\n\"But, my child,\" she returned, \"is it possible that you don't know\nwhat has happened?\"\n\n\"No,\" said I.\n\n\"Not what everybody has been talking of, my beloved Fitz Jarndyce!\"\n\n\"No,\" said I. \"You forget how long I have been here.\"\n\n\"True! My dear, for the moment--true. I blame myself. But my memory\nhas been drawn out of me, with everything else, by what I mentioned.\nVe-ry strong influence, is it not? Well, my dear, there has been a\nterrible shipwreck over in those East Indian seas.\"\n\n\"Mr. Woodcourt shipwrecked!\"\n\n\"Don't be agitated, my dear. He is safe. An awful scene. Death in all\nshapes. Hundreds of dead and dying. Fire, storm, and darkness.\nNumbers of the drowning thrown upon a rock. There, and through it\nall, my dear physician was a hero. Calm and brave through everything.\nSaved many lives, never complained in hunger and thirst, wrapped\nnaked people in his spare clothes, took the lead, showed them what to\ndo, governed them, tended the sick, buried the dead, and brought the\npoor survivors safely off at last! My dear, the poor emaciated\ncreatures all but worshipped him. They fell down at his feet when\nthey got to the land and blessed him. The whole country rings with\nit. Stay! Where's my bag of documents? I have got it there, and you\nshall read it, you shall read it!\"\n\nAnd I DID read all the noble history, though very slowly and\nimperfectly then, for my eyes were so dimmed that I could not see the\nwords, and I cried so much that I was many times obliged to lay down\nthe long account she had cut out of the newspaper. I felt so\ntriumphant ever to have known the man who had done such generous and\ngallant deeds, I felt such glowing exultation in his renown, I so\nadmired and loved what he had done, that I envied the storm-worn\npeople who had fallen at his feet and blessed him as their preserver.\nI could myself have kneeled down then, so far away, and blessed him\nin my rapture that he should be so truly good and brave. I felt that\nno one--mother, sister, wife--could honour him more than I. I did,\nindeed!\n\nMy poor little visitor made me a present of the account, and when as\nthe evening began to close in she rose to take her leave, lest she\nshould miss the coach by which she was to return, she was still full\nof the shipwreck, which I had not yet sufficiently composed myself to\nunderstand in all its details.\n\n\"My dear,\" said she as she carefully folded up her scarf and gloves,\n\"my brave physician ought to have a title bestowed upon him. And no\ndoubt he will. You are of that opinion?\"\n\nThat he well deserved one, yes. That he would ever have one, no.\n\n\"Why not, Fitz Jarndyce?\" she asked rather sharply.\n\nI said it was not the custom in England to confer titles on men\ndistinguished by peaceful services, however good and great, unless\noccasionally when they consisted of the accumulation of some very\nlarge amount of money.\n\n\"Why, good gracious,\" said Miss Flite, \"how can you say that? Surely\nyou know, my dear, that all the greatest ornaments of England in\nknowledge, imagination, active humanity, and improvement of every\nsort are added to its nobility! Look round you, my dear, and\nconsider. YOU must be rambling a little now, I think, if you don't\nknow that this is the great reason why titles will always last in the\nland!\"\n\nI am afraid she believed what she said, for there were moments when\nshe was very mad indeed.\n\nAnd now I must part with the little secret I have thus far tried to\nkeep. I had thought, sometimes, that Mr. Woodcourt loved me and that\nif he had been richer he would perhaps have told me that he loved me\nbefore he went away. I had thought, sometimes, that if he had done\nso, I should have been glad of it. But how much better it was now\nthat this had never happened! What should I have suffered if I had\nhad to write to him and tell him that the poor face he had known as\nmine was quite gone from me and that I freely released him from his\nbondage to one whom he had never seen!\n\nOh, it was so much better as it was! With a great pang mercifully\nspared me, I could take back to my heart my childish prayer to be all\nhe had so brightly shown himself; and there was nothing to be undone:\nno chain for me to break or for him to drag; and I could go, please\nGod, my lowly way along the path of duty, and he could go his nobler\nway upon its broader road; and though we were apart upon the journey,\nI might aspire to meet him, unselfishly, innocently, better far than\nhe had thought me when I found some favour in his eyes, at the\njourney's end.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXVI\n\nChesney Wold\n\n\nCharley and I did not set off alone upon our expedition into\nLincolnshire. My guardian had made up his mind not to lose sight of\nme until I was safe in Mr. Boythorn's house, so he accompanied us,\nand we were two days upon the road. I found every breath of air, and\nevery scent, and every flower and leaf and blade of grass, and every\npassing cloud, and everything in nature, more beautiful and wonderful\nto me than I had ever found it yet. This was my first gain from my\nillness. How little I had lost, when the wide world was so full of\ndelight for me.\n\nMy guardian intending to go back immediately, we appointed, on our\nway down, a day when my dear girl should come. I wrote her a letter,\nof which he took charge, and he left us within half an hour of our\narrival at our destination, on a delightful evening in the early\nsummer-time.\n\nIf a good fairy had built the house for me with a wave of her wand,\nand I had been a princess and her favoured god-child, I could not\nhave been more considered in it. So many preparations were made for\nme and such an endearing remembrance was shown of all my little\ntastes and likings that I could have sat down, overcome, a dozen\ntimes before I had revisited half the rooms. I did better than that,\nhowever, by showing them all to Charley instead. Charley's delight\ncalmed mine; and after we had had a walk in the garden, and Charley\nhad exhausted her whole vocabulary of admiring expressions, I was as\ntranquilly happy as I ought to have been. It was a great comfort to\nbe able to say to myself after tea, \"Esther, my dear, I think you are\nquite sensible enough to sit down now and write a note of thanks to\nyour host.\" He had left a note of welcome for me, as sunny as his own\nface, and had confided his bird to my care, which I knew to be his\nhighest mark of confidence. Accordingly I wrote a little note to him\nin London, telling him how all his favourite plants and trees were\nlooking, and how the most astonishing of birds had chirped the\nhonours of the house to me in the most hospitable manner, and how,\nafter singing on my shoulder, to the inconceivable rapture of my\nlittle maid, he was then at roost in the usual corner of his cage,\nbut whether dreaming or no I could not report. My note finished and\nsent off to the post, I made myself very busy in unpacking and\narranging; and I sent Charley to bed in good time and told her I\nshould want her no more that night.\n\nFor I had not yet looked in the glass and had never asked to have my\nown restored to me. I knew this to be a weakness which must be\novercome, but I had always said to myself that I would begin afresh\nwhen I got to where I now was. Therefore I had wanted to be alone,\nand therefore I said, now alone, in my own room, \"Esther, if you are\nto be happy, if you are to have any right to pray to be true-hearted,\nyou must keep your word, my dear.\" I was quite resolved to keep it,\nbut I sat down for a little while first to reflect upon all my\nblessings. And then I said my prayers and thought a little more.\n\nMy hair had not been cut off, though it had been in danger more than\nonce. It was long and thick. I let it down, and shook it out, and\nwent up to the glass upon the dressing-table. There was a little\nmuslin curtain drawn across it. I drew it back and stood for a moment\nlooking through such a veil of my own hair that I could see nothing\nelse. Then I put my hair aside and looked at the reflection in the\nmirror, encouraged by seeing how placidly it looked at me. I was very\nmuch changed--oh, very, very much. At first my face was so strange to\nme that I think I should have put my hands before it and started back\nbut for the encouragement I have mentioned. Very soon it became more\nfamiliar, and then I knew the extent of the alteration in it better\nthan I had done at first. It was not like what I had expected, but I\nhad expected nothing definite, and I dare say anything definite would\nhave surprised me.\n\nI had never been a beauty and had never thought myself one, but I had\nbeen very different from this. It was all gone now. Heaven was so\ngood to me that I could let it go with a few not bitter tears and\ncould stand there arranging my hair for the night quite thankfully.\n\nOne thing troubled me, and I considered it for a long time before I\nwent to sleep. I had kept Mr. Woodcourt's flowers. When they were\nwithered I had dried them and put them in a book that I was fond of.\nNobody knew this, not even Ada. I was doubtful whether I had a right\nto preserve what he had sent to one so different--whether it was\ngenerous towards him to do it. I wished to be generous to him, even\nin the secret depths of my heart, which he would never know, because\nI could have loved him--could have been devoted to him. At last I\ncame to the conclusion that I might keep them if I treasured them\nonly as a remembrance of what was irrevocably past and gone, never to\nbe looked back on any more, in any other light. I hope this may not\nseem trivial. I was very much in earnest.\n\nI took care to be up early in the morning and to be before the glass\nwhen Charley came in on tiptoe.\n\n\"Dear, dear, miss!\" cried Charley, starting. \"Is that you?\"\n\n\"Yes, Charley,\" said I, quietly putting up my hair. \"And I am very\nwell indeed, and very happy.\"\n\nI saw it was a weight off Charley's mind, but it was a greater weight\noff mine. I knew the worst now and was composed to it. I shall not\nconceal, as I go on, the weaknesses I could not quite conquer, but\nthey always passed from me soon and the happier frame of mind stayed\nby me faithfully.\n\nWishing to be fully re-established in my strength and my good spirits\nbefore Ada came, I now laid down a little series of plans with\nCharley for being in the fresh air all day long. We were to be out\nbefore breakfast, and were to dine early, and were to be out again\nbefore and after dinner, and were to talk in the garden after tea,\nand were to go to rest betimes, and were to climb every hill and\nexplore every road, lane, and field in the neighbourhood. As to\nrestoratives and strengthening delicacies, Mr. Boythorn's good\nhousekeeper was for ever trotting about with something to eat or\ndrink in her hand; I could not even be heard of as resting in the\npark but she would come trotting after me with a basket, her cheerful\nface shining with a lecture on the importance of frequent\nnourishment. Then there was a pony expressly for my riding, a chubby\npony with a short neck and a mane all over his eyes who could\ncanter--when he would--so easily and quietly that he was a treasure.\nIn a very few days he would come to me in the paddock when I called\nhim, and eat out of my hand, and follow me about. We arrived at such\na capital understanding that when he was jogging with me lazily, and\nrather obstinately, down some shady lane, if I patted his neck and\nsaid, \"Stubbs, I am surprised you don't canter when you know how much\nI like it; and I think you might oblige me, for you are only getting\nstupid and going to sleep,\" he would give his head a comical shake or\ntwo and set off directly, while Charley would stand still and laugh\nwith such enjoyment that her laughter was like music. I don't know\nwho had given Stubbs his name, but it seemed to belong to him as\nnaturally as his rough coat. Once we put him in a little chaise and\ndrove him triumphantly through the green lanes for five miles; but\nall at once, as we were extolling him to the skies, he seemed to take\nit ill that he should have been accompanied so far by the circle of\ntantalizing little gnats that had been hovering round and round his\nears the whole way without appearing to advance an inch, and stopped\nto think about it. I suppose he came to the decision that it was not\nto be borne, for he steadily refused to move until I gave the reins\nto Charley and got out and walked, when he followed me with a sturdy\nsort of good humour, putting his head under my arm and rubbing his\near against my sleeve. It was in vain for me to say, \"Now, Stubbs, I\nfeel quite sure from what I know of you that you will go on if I ride\na little while,\" for the moment I left him, he stood stock still\nagain. Consequently I was obliged to lead the way, as before; and in\nthis order we returned home, to the great delight of the village.\n\nCharley and I had reason to call it the most friendly of villages, I\nam sure, for in a week's time the people were so glad to see us go\nby, though ever so frequently in the course of a day, that there were\nfaces of greeting in every cottage. I had known many of the grown\npeople before and almost all the children, but now the very steeple\nbegan to wear a familiar and affectionate look. Among my new friends\nwas an old old woman who lived in such a little thatched and\nwhitewashed dwelling that when the outside shutter was turned up on\nits hinges, it shut up the whole house-front. This old lady had a\ngrandson who was a sailor, and I wrote a letter to him for her and\ndrew at the top of it the chimney-corner in which she had brought him\nup and where his old stool yet occupied its old place. This was\nconsidered by the whole village the most wonderful achievement in the\nworld, but when an answer came back all the way from Plymouth, in\nwhich he mentioned that he was going to take the picture all the way\nto America, and from America would write again, I got all the credit\nthat ought to have been given to the post-office and was invested\nwith the merit of the whole system.\n\nThus, what with being so much in the air, playing with so many\nchildren, gossiping with so many people, sitting on invitation in so\nmany cottages, going on with Charley's education, and writing long\nletters to Ada every day, I had scarcely any time to think about that\nlittle loss of mine and was almost always cheerful. If I did think of\nit at odd moments now and then, I had only to be busy and forget it.\nI felt it more than I had hoped I should once when a child said,\n\"Mother, why is the lady not a pretty lady now like she used to be?\"\nBut when I found the child was not less fond of me, and drew its soft\nhand over my face with a kind of pitying protection in its touch,\nthat soon set me up again. There were many little occurrences which\nsuggested to me, with great consolation, how natural it is to gentle\nhearts to be considerate and delicate towards any inferiority. One of\nthese particularly touched me. I happened to stroll into the little\nchurch when a marriage was just concluded, and the young couple had\nto sign the register.\n\nThe bridegroom, to whom the pen was handed first, made a rude cross\nfor his mark; the bride, who came next, did the same. Now, I had\nknown the bride when I was last there, not only as the prettiest girl\nin the place, but as having quite distinguished herself in the\nschool, and I could not help looking at her with some surprise. She\ncame aside and whispered to me, while tears of honest love and\nadmiration stood in her bright eyes, \"He's a dear good fellow, miss;\nbut he can't write yet--he's going to learn of me--and I wouldn't\nshame him for the world!\" Why, what had I to fear, I thought, when\nthere was this nobility in the soul of a labouring man's daughter!\n\nThe air blew as freshly and revivingly upon me as it had ever blown,\nand the healthy colour came into my new face as it had come into my\nold one. Charley was wonderful to see, she was so radiant and so\nrosy; and we both enjoyed the whole day and slept soundly the whole\nnight.\n\nThere was a favourite spot of mine in the park-woods of Chesney Wold\nwhere a seat had been erected commanding a lovely view. The wood had\nbeen cleared and opened to improve this point of sight, and the\nbright sunny landscape beyond was so beautiful that I rested there at\nleast once every day. A picturesque part of the Hall, called the\nGhost's Walk, was seen to advantage from this higher ground; and the\nstartling name, and the old legend in the Dedlock family which I had\nheard from Mr. Boythorn accounting for it, mingled with the view and\ngave it something of a mysterious interest in addition to its real\ncharms. There was a bank here, too, which was a famous one for\nviolets; and as it was a daily delight of Charley's to gather wild\nflowers, she took as much to the spot as I did.\n\nIt would be idle to inquire now why I never went close to the house\nor never went inside it. The family were not there, I had heard on my\narrival, and were not expected. I was far from being incurious or\nuninterested about the building; on the contrary, I often sat in this\nplace wondering how the rooms ranged and whether any echo like a\nfootstep really did resound at times, as the story said, upon the\nlonely Ghost's Walk. The indefinable feeling with which Lady Dedlock\nhad impressed me may have had some influence in keeping me from the\nhouse even when she was absent. I am not sure. Her face and figure\nwere associated with it, naturally; but I cannot say that they\nrepelled me from it, though something did. For whatever reason or no\nreason, I had never once gone near it, down to the day at which my\nstory now arrives.\n\nI was resting at my favourite point after a long ramble, and Charley\nwas gathering violets at a little distance from me. I had been\nlooking at the Ghost's Walk lying in a deep shade of masonry afar off\nand picturing to myself the female shape that was said to haunt it\nwhen I became aware of a figure approaching through the wood. The\nperspective was so long and so darkened by leaves, and the shadows of\nthe branches on the ground made it so much more intricate to the eye,\nthat at first I could not discern what figure it was. By little and\nlittle it revealed itself to be a woman's--a lady's--Lady Dedlock's.\nShe was alone and coming to where I sat with a much quicker step, I\nobserved to my surprise, than was usual with her.\n\nI was fluttered by her being unexpectedly so near (she was almost\nwithin speaking distance before I knew her) and would have risen to\ncontinue my walk. But I could not. I was rendered motionless. Not so\nmuch by her hurried gesture of entreaty, not so much by her quick\nadvance and outstretched hands, not so much by the great change in\nher manner and the absence of her haughty self-restraint, as by a\nsomething in her face that I had pined for and dreamed of when I was\na little child, something I had never seen in any face, something I\nhad never seen in hers before.\n\nA dread and faintness fell upon me, and I called to Charley. Lady\nDedlock stopped upon the instant and changed back almost to what I\nhad known her.\n\n\"Miss Summerson, I am afraid I have startled you,\" she said, now\nadvancing slowly. \"You can scarcely be strong yet. You have been very\nill, I know. I have been much concerned to hear it.\"\n\nI could no more have removed my eyes from her pale face than I could\nhave stirred from the bench on which I sat. She gave me her hand, and\nits deadly coldness, so at variance with the enforced composure of\nher features, deepened the fascination that overpowered me. I cannot\nsay what was in my whirling thoughts.\n\n\"You are recovering again?\" she asked kindly.\n\n\"I was quite well but a moment ago, Lady Dedlock.\"\n\n\"Is this your young attendant?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Will you send her on before and walk towards your house with me?\"\n\n\"Charley,\" said I, \"take your flowers home, and I will follow you\ndirectly.\"\n\nCharley, with her best curtsy, blushingly tied on her bonnet and went\nher way. When she was gone, Lady Dedlock sat down on the seat beside\nme.\n\nI cannot tell in any words what the state of my mind was when I saw\nin her hand my handkerchief with which I had covered the dead baby.\n\nI looked at her, but I could not see her, I could not hear her, I\ncould not draw my breath. The beating of my heart was so violent and\nwild that I felt as if my life were breaking from me. But when she\ncaught me to her breast, kissed me, wept over me, compassionated me,\nand called me back to myself; when she fell down on her knees and\ncried to me, \"Oh, my child, my child, I am your wicked and unhappy\nmother! Oh, try to forgive me!\"--when I saw her at my feet on the\nbare earth in her great agony of mind, I felt, through all my tumult\nof emotion, a burst of gratitude to the providence of God that I was\nso changed as that I never could disgrace her by any trace of\nlikeness, as that nobody could ever now look at me and look at her\nand remotely think of any near tie between us.\n\nI raised my mother up, praying and beseeching her not to stoop before\nme in such affliction and humiliation. I did so in broken, incoherent\nwords, for besides the trouble I was in, it frightened me to see her\nat MY feet. I told her--or I tried to tell her--that if it were for\nme, her child, under any circumstances to take upon me to forgive\nher, I did it, and had done it, many, many years. I told her that my\nheart overflowed with love for her, that it was natural love which\nnothing in the past had changed or could change. That it was not for\nme, then resting for the first time on my mother's bosom, to take her\nto account for having given me life, but that my duty was to bless\nher and receive her, though the whole world turned from her, and that\nI only asked her leave to do it. I held my mother in my embrace, and\nshe held me in hers, and among the still woods in the silence of the\nsummer day there seemed to be nothing but our two troubled minds that\nwas not at peace.\n\n\"To bless and receive me,\" groaned my mother, \"it is far too late. I\nmust travel my dark road alone, and it will lead me where it will.\nFrom day to day, sometimes from hour to hour, I do not see the way\nbefore my guilty feet. This is the earthly punishment I have brought\nupon myself. I bear it, and I hide it.\"\n\nEven in the thinking of her endurance, she drew her habitual air of\nproud indifference about her like a veil, though she soon cast it off\nagain.\n\n\"I must keep this secret, if by any means it can be kept, not wholly\nfor myself. I have a husband, wretched and dishonouring creature that\nI am!\"\n\nThese words she uttered with a suppressed cry of despair, more\nterrible in its sound than any shriek. Covering her face with her\nhands, she shrank down in my embrace as if she were unwilling that I\nshould touch her; nor could I, by my utmost persuasions or by any\nendearments I could use, prevail upon her to rise. She said, no, no,\nno, she could only speak to me so; she must be proud and disdainful\neverywhere else; she would be humbled and ashamed there, in the only\nnatural moments of her life.\n\nMy unhappy mother told me that in my illness she had been nearly\nfrantic. She had but then known that her child was living. She could\nnot have suspected me to be that child before. She had followed me\ndown here to speak to me but once in all her life. We never could\nassociate, never could communicate, never probably from that time\nforth could interchange another word on earth. She put into my hands\na letter she had written for my reading only and said when I had read\nit and destroyed it--but not so much for her sake, since she asked\nnothing, as for her husband's and my own--I must evermore consider\nher as dead. If I could believe that she loved me, in this agony in\nwhich I saw her, with a mother's love, she asked me to do that, for\nthen I might think of her with a greater pity, imagining what she\nsuffered. She had put herself beyond all hope and beyond all help.\nWhether she preserved her secret until death or it came to be\ndiscovered and she brought dishonour and disgrace upon the name she\nhad taken, it was her solitary struggle always; and no affection\ncould come near her, and no human creature could render her any aid.\n\n\"But is the secret safe so far?\" I asked. \"Is it safe now, dearest\nmother?\"\n\n\"No,\" replied my mother. \"It has been very near discovery. It was\nsaved by an accident. It may be lost by another accident--to-morrow,\nany day.\"\n\n\"Do you dread a particular person?\"\n\n\"Hush! Do not tremble and cry so much for me. I am not worthy of\nthese tears,\" said my mother, kissing my hands. \"I dread one person\nvery much.\"\n\n\"An enemy?\"\n\n\"Not a friend. One who is too passionless to be either. He is Sir\nLeicester Dedlock's lawyer, mechanically faithful without attachment,\nand very jealous of the profit, privilege, and reputation of being\nmaster of the mysteries of great houses.\"\n\n\"Has he any suspicions?\"\n\n\"Many.\"\n\n\"Not of you?\" I said alarmed.\n\n\"Yes! He is always vigilant and always near me. I may keep him at a\nstandstill, but I can never shake him off.\"\n\n\"Has he so little pity or compunction?\"\n\n\"He has none, and no anger. He is indifferent to everything but his\ncalling. His calling is the acquisition of secrets and the holding\npossession of such power as they give him, with no sharer or opponent\nin it.\"\n\n\"Could you trust in him?\"\n\n\"I shall never try. The dark road I have trodden for so many years\nwill end where it will. I follow it alone to the end, whatever the\nend be. It may be near, it may be distant; while the road lasts,\nnothing turns me.\"\n\n\"Dear mother, are you so resolved?\"\n\n\"I AM resolved. I have long outbidden folly with folly, pride with\npride, scorn with scorn, insolence with insolence, and have outlived\nmany vanities with many more. I will outlive this danger, and outdie\nit, if I can. It has closed around me almost as awfully as if these\nwoods of Chesney Wold had closed around the house, but my course\nthrough it is the same. I have but one; I can have but one.\"\n\n\"Mr. Jarndyce--\" I was beginning when my mother hurriedly inquired,\n\"Does HE suspect?\"\n\n\"No,\" said I. \"No, indeed! Be assured that he does not!\" And I told\nher what he had related to me as his knowledge of my story. \"But he\nis so good and sensible,\" said I, \"that perhaps if he knew--\"\n\nMy mother, who until this time had made no change in her position,\nraised her hand up to my lips and stopped me.\n\n\"Confide fully in him,\" she said after a little while. \"You have my\nfree consent--a small gift from such a mother to her injured\nchild!--but do not tell me of it. Some pride is left in me even yet.\"\n\nI explained, as nearly as I could then, or can recall now--for my\nagitation and distress throughout were so great that I scarcely\nunderstood myself, though every word that was uttered in the mother's\nvoice, so unfamiliar and so melancholy to me, which in my childhood I\nhad never learned to love and recognize, had never been sung to sleep\nwith, had never heard a blessing from, had never had a hope inspired\nby, made an enduring impression on my memory--I say I explained, or\ntried to do it, how I had only hoped that Mr. Jarndyce, who had been\nthe best of fathers to me, might be able to afford some counsel and\nsupport to her. But my mother answered no, it was impossible; no one\ncould help her. Through the desert that lay before her, she must go\nalone.\n\n\"My child, my child!\" she said. \"For the last time! These kisses for\nthe last time! These arms upon my neck for the last time! We shall\nmeet no more. To hope to do what I seek to do, I must be what I have\nbeen so long. Such is my reward and doom. If you hear of Lady\nDedlock, brilliant, prosperous, and flattered, think of your wretched\nmother, conscience-stricken, underneath that mask! Think that the\nreality is in her suffering, in her useless remorse, in her murdering\nwithin her breast the only love and truth of which it is capable! And\nthen forgive her if you can, and cry to heaven to forgive her, which\nit never can!\"\n\nWe held one another for a little space yet, but she was so firm that\nshe took my hands away, and put them back against my breast, and with\na last kiss as she held them there, released them, and went from me\ninto the wood. I was alone, and calm and quiet below me in the sun\nand shade lay the old house, with its terraces and turrets, on which\nthere had seemed to me to be such complete repose when I first saw\nit, but which now looked like the obdurate and unpitying watcher of\nmy mother's misery.\n\nStunned as I was, as weak and helpless at first as I had ever been in\nmy sick chamber, the necessity of guarding against the danger of\ndiscovery, or even of the remotest suspicion, did me service. I took\nsuch precautions as I could to hide from Charley that I had been\ncrying, and I constrained myself to think of every sacred obligation\nthat there was upon me to be careful and collected. It was not a\nlittle while before I could succeed or could even restrain bursts of\ngrief, but after an hour or so I was better and felt that I might\nreturn. I went home very slowly and told Charley, whom I found at the\ngate looking for me, that I had been tempted to extend my walk after\nLady Dedlock had left me and that I was over-tired and would lie\ndown. Safe in my own room, I read the letter. I clearly derived from\nit--and that was much then--that I had not been abandoned by my\nmother. Her elder and only sister, the godmother of my childhood,\ndiscovering signs of life in me when I had been laid aside as dead,\nhad in her stern sense of duty, with no desire or willingness that I\nshould live, reared me in rigid secrecy and had never again beheld my\nmother's face from within a few hours of my birth. So strangely did I\nhold my place in this world that until within a short time back I had\nnever, to my own mother's knowledge, breathed--had been buried--had\nnever been endowed with life--had never borne a name. When she had\nfirst seen me in the church she had been startled and had thought of\nwhat would have been like me if it had ever lived, and had lived on,\nbut that was all then.\n\nWhat more the letter told me needs not to be repeated here. It has\nits own times and places in my story.\n\nMy first care was to burn what my mother had written and to consume\neven its ashes. I hope it may not appear very unnatural or bad in me\nthat I then became heavily sorrowful to think I had ever been reared.\nThat I felt as if I knew it would have been better and happier for\nmany people if indeed I had never breathed. That I had a terror of\nmyself as the danger and the possible disgrace of my own mother and\nof a proud family name. That I was so confused and shaken as to be\npossessed by a belief that it was right and had been intended that I\nshould die in my birth, and that it was wrong and not intended that I\nshould be then alive.\n\nThese are the real feelings that I had. I fell asleep worn out, and\nwhen I awoke I cried afresh to think that I was back in the world\nwith my load of trouble for others. I was more than ever frightened\nof myself, thinking anew of her against whom I was a witness, of the\nowner of Chesney Wold, of the new and terrible meaning of the old\nwords now moaning in my ear like a surge upon the shore, \"Your\nmother, Esther, was your disgrace, and you are hers. The time will\ncome--and soon enough--when you will understand this better, and will\nfeel it too, as no one save a woman can.\" With them, those other\nwords returned, \"Pray daily that the sins of others be not visited\nupon your head.\" I could not disentangle all that was about me, and I\nfelt as if the blame and the shame were all in me, and the visitation\nhad come down.\n\nThe day waned into a gloomy evening, overcast and sad, and I still\ncontended with the same distress. I went out alone, and after walking\na little in the park, watching the dark shades falling on the trees\nand the fitful flight of the bats, which sometimes almost touched me,\nwas attracted to the house for the first time. Perhaps I might not\nhave gone near it if I had been in a stronger frame of mind. As it\nwas, I took the path that led close by it.\n\nI did not dare to linger or to look up, but I passed before the\nterrace garden with its fragrant odours, and its broad walks, and its\nwell-kept beds and smooth turf; and I saw how beautiful and grave it\nwas, and how the old stone balustrades and parapets, and wide flights\nof shallow steps, were seamed by time and weather; and how the\ntrained moss and ivy grew about them, and around the old stone\npedestal of the sun-dial; and I heard the fountain falling. Then the\nway went by long lines of dark windows diversified by turreted towers\nand porches of eccentric shapes, where old stone lions and grotesque\nmonsters bristled outside dens of shadow and snarled at the evening\ngloom over the escutcheons they held in their grip. Thence the path\nwound underneath a gateway, and through a court-yard where the\nprincipal entrance was (I hurried quickly on), and by the stables\nwhere none but deep voices seemed to be, whether in the murmuring of\nthe wind through the strong mass of ivy holding to a high red wall,\nor in the low complaining of the weathercock, or in the barking of\nthe dogs, or in the slow striking of a clock. So, encountering\npresently a sweet smell of limes, whose rustling I could hear, I\nturned with the turning of the path to the south front, and there\nabove me were the balustrades of the Ghost's Walk and one lighted\nwindow that might be my mother's.\n\nThe way was paved here, like the terrace overhead, and my footsteps\nfrom being noiseless made an echoing sound upon the flags. Stopping\nto look at nothing, but seeing all I did see as I went, I was passing\nquickly on, and in a few moments should have passed the lighted\nwindow, when my echoing footsteps brought it suddenly into my mind\nthat there was a dreadful truth in the legend of the Ghost's Walk,\nthat it was I who was to bring calamity upon the stately house and\nthat my warning feet were haunting it even then. Seized with an\naugmented terror of myself which turned me cold, I ran from myself\nand everything, retraced the way by which I had come, and never\npaused until I had gained the lodge-gate, and the park lay sullen and\nblack behind me.\n\nNot before I was alone in my own room for the night and had again\nbeen dejected and unhappy there did I begin to know how wrong and\nthankless this state was. But from my darling who was coming on the\nmorrow, I found a joyful letter, full of such loving anticipation\nthat I must have been of marble if it had not moved me; from my\nguardian, too, I found another letter, asking me to tell Dame Durden,\nif I should see that little woman anywhere, that they had moped most\npitiably without her, that the housekeeping was going to rack and\nruin, that nobody else could manage the keys, and that everybody in\nand about the house declared it was not the same house and was\nbecoming rebellious for her return. Two such letters together made me\nthink how far beyond my deserts I was beloved and how happy I ought\nto be. That made me think of all my past life; and that brought me,\nas it ought to have done before, into a better condition.\n\nFor I saw very well that I could not have been intended to die, or I\nshould never have lived; not to say should never have been reserved\nfor such a happy life. I saw very well how many things had worked\ntogether for my welfare, and that if the sins of the fathers were\nsometimes visited upon the children, the phrase did not mean what I\nhad in the morning feared it meant. I knew I was as innocent of my\nbirth as a queen of hers and that before my Heavenly Father I should\nnot be punished for birth nor a queen rewarded for it. I had had\nexperience, in the shock of that very day, that I could, even thus\nsoon, find comforting reconcilements to the change that had fallen on\nme. I renewed my resolutions and prayed to be strengthened in them,\npouring out my heart for myself and for my unhappy mother and feeling\nthat the darkness of the morning was passing away. It was not upon my\nsleep; and when the next day's light awoke me, it was gone.\n\nMy dear girl was to arrive at five o'clock in the afternoon. How to\nhelp myself through the intermediate time better than by taking a\nlong walk along the road by which she was to come, I did not know; so\nCharley and I and Stubbs--Stubbs saddled, for we never drove him\nafter the one great occasion--made a long expedition along that road\nand back. On our return, we held a great review of the house and\ngarden and saw that everything was in its prettiest condition, and\nhad the bird out ready as an important part of the establishment.\n\nThere were more than two full hours yet to elapse before she could\ncome, and in that interval, which seemed a long one, I must confess I\nwas nervously anxious about my altered looks. I loved my darling so\nwell that I was more concerned for their effect on her than on any\none. I was not in this slight distress because I at all repined--I am\nquite certain I did not, that day--but, I thought, would she be\nwholly prepared? When she first saw me, might she not be a little\nshocked and disappointed? Might it not prove a little worse than she\nexpected? Might she not look for her old Esther and not find her?\nMight she not have to grow used to me and to begin all over again?\n\nI knew the various expressions of my sweet girl's face so well, and\nit was such an honest face in its loveliness, that I was sure\nbeforehand she could not hide that first look from me. And I\nconsidered whether, if it should signify any one of these meanings,\nwhich was so very likely, could I quite answer for myself?\n\nWell, I thought I could. After last night, I thought I could. But to\nwait and wait, and expect and expect, and think and think, was such\nbad preparation that I resolved to go along the road again and meet\nher.\n\nSo I said to Charley, \"Charley, I will go by myself and walk along\nthe road until she comes.\" Charley highly approving of anything that\npleased me, I went and left her at home.\n\nBut before I got to the second milestone, I had been in so many\npalpitations from seeing dust in the distance (though I knew it was\nnot, and could not, be the coach yet) that I resolved to turn back\nand go home again. And when I had turned, I was in such fear of the\ncoach coming up behind me (though I still knew that it neither would,\nnor could, do any such thing) that I ran the greater part of the way\nto avoid being overtaken.\n\nThen, I considered, when I had got safe back again, this was a nice\nthing to have done! Now I was hot and had made the worst of it\ninstead of the best.\n\nAt last, when I believed there was at least a quarter of an hour more\nyet, Charley all at once cried out to me as I was trembling in the\ngarden, \"Here she comes, miss! Here she is!\"\n\nI did not mean to do it, but I ran upstairs into my room and hid\nmyself behind the door. There I stood trembling, even when I heard my\ndarling calling as she came upstairs, \"Esther, my dear, my love,\nwhere are you? Little woman, dear Dame Durden!\"\n\nShe ran in, and was running out again when she saw me. Ah, my angel\ngirl! The old dear look, all love, all fondness, all affection.\nNothing else in it--no, nothing, nothing!\n\nOh, how happy I was, down upon the floor, with my sweet beautiful\ngirl down upon the floor too, holding my scarred face to her lovely\ncheek, bathing it with tears and kisses, rocking me to and fro like a\nchild, calling me by every tender name that she could think of, and\npressing me to her faithful heart.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXVII\n\nJarndyce and Jarndyce\n\n\nIf the secret I had to keep had been mine, I must have confided it to\nAda before we had been long together. But it was not mine, and I did\nnot feel that I had a right to tell it, even to my guardian, unless\nsome great emergency arose. It was a weight to bear alone; still my\npresent duty appeared to be plain, and blest in the attachment of my\ndear, I did not want an impulse and encouragement to do it. Though\noften when she was asleep and all was quiet, the remembrance of my\nmother kept me waking and made the night sorrowful, I did not yield\nto it at another time; and Ada found me what I used to be--except, of\ncourse, in that particular of which I have said enough and which I\nhave no intention of mentioning any more just now, if I can help it.\n\nThe difficulty that I felt in being quite composed that first evening\nwhen Ada asked me, over our work, if the family were at the house,\nand when I was obliged to answer yes, I believed so, for Lady Dedlock\nhad spoken to me in the woods the day before yesterday, was great.\nGreater still when Ada asked me what she had said, and when I replied\nthat she had been kind and interested, and when Ada, while admitting\nher beauty and elegance, remarked upon her proud manner and her\nimperious chilling air. But Charley helped me through, unconsciously,\nby telling us that Lady Dedlock had only stayed at the house two\nnights on her way from London to visit at some other great house in\nthe next county and that she had left early on the morning after we\nhad seen her at our view, as we called it. Charley verified the adage\nabout little pitchers, I am sure, for she heard of more sayings and\ndoings in a day than would have come to my ears in a month.\n\nWe were to stay a month at Mr. Boythorn's. My pet had scarcely been\nthere a bright week, as I recollect the time, when one evening after\nwe had finished helping the gardener in watering his flowers, and\njust as the candles were lighted, Charley, appearing with a very\nimportant air behind Ada's chair, beckoned me mysteriously out of the\nroom.\n\n\"Oh! If you please, miss,\" said Charley in a whisper, with her eyes\nat their roundest and largest. \"You're wanted at the Dedlock Arms.\"\n\n\"Why, Charley,\" said I, \"who can possibly want me at the\npublic-house?\"\n\n\"I don't know, miss,\" returned Charley, putting her head forward and\nfolding her hands tight upon the band of her little apron, which she\nalways did in the enjoyment of anything mysterious or confidential,\n\"but it's a gentleman, miss, and his compliments, and will you please\nto come without saying anything about it.\"\n\n\"Whose compliments, Charley?\"\n\n\"His'n, miss,\" returned Charley, whose grammatical education was\nadvancing, but not very rapidly.\n\n\"And how do you come to be the messenger, Charley?\"\n\n\"I am not the messenger, if you please, miss,\" returned my little\nmaid. \"It was W. Grubble, miss.\"\n\n\"And who is W. Grubble, Charley?\"\n\n\"Mister Grubble, miss,\" returned Charley. \"Don't you know, miss? The\nDedlock Arms, by W. Grubble,\" which Charley delivered as if she were\nslowly spelling out the sign.\n\n\"Aye? The landlord, Charley?\"\n\n\"Yes, miss. If you please, miss, his wife is a beautiful woman, but\nshe broke her ankle, and it never joined. And her brother's the\nsawyer that was put in the cage, miss, and they expect he'll drink\nhimself to death entirely on beer,\" said Charley.\n\nNot knowing what might be the matter, and being easily apprehensive\nnow, I thought it best to go to this place by myself. I bade Charley\nbe quick with my bonnet and veil and my shawl, and having put them\non, went away down the little hilly street, where I was as much at\nhome as in Mr. Boythorn's garden.\n\nMr. Grubble was standing in his shirt-sleeves at the door of his very\nclean little tavern waiting for me. He lifted off his hat with both\nhands when he saw me coming, and carrying it so, as if it were an\niron vessel (it looked as heavy), preceded me along the sanded\npassage to his best parlour, a neat carpeted room with more plants in\nit than were quite convenient, a coloured print of Queen Caroline,\nseveral shells, a good many tea-trays, two stuffed and dried fish in\nglass cases, and either a curious egg or a curious pumpkin (but I\ndon't know which, and I doubt if many people did) hanging from his\nceiling. I knew Mr. Grubble very well by sight, from his often\nstanding at his door. A pleasant-looking, stoutish, middle-aged man\nwho never seemed to consider himself cozily dressed for his own\nfire-side without his hat and top-boots, but who never wore a coat\nexcept at church.\n\nHe snuffed the candle, and backing away a little to see how it\nlooked, backed out of the room--unexpectedly to me, for I was going\nto ask him by whom he had been sent. The door of the opposite parlour\nbeing then opened, I heard some voices, familiar in my ears I\nthought, which stopped. A quick light step approached the room in\nwhich I was, and who should stand before me but Richard!\n\n\"My dear Esther!\" he said. \"My best friend!\" And he really was so\nwarm-hearted and earnest that in the first surprise and pleasure of\nhis brotherly greeting I could scarcely find breath to tell him that\nAda was well.\n\n\"Answering my very thoughts--always the same dear girl!\" said\nRichard, leading me to a chair and seating himself beside me.\n\nI put my veil up, but not quite.\n\n\"Always the same dear girl!\" said Richard just as heartily as before.\n\nI put up my veil altogether, and laying my hand on Richard's sleeve\nand looking in his face, told him how much I thanked him for his kind\nwelcome and how greatly I rejoiced to see him, the more so because of\nthe determination I had made in my illness, which I now conveyed to\nhim.\n\n\"My love,\" said Richard, \"there is no one with whom I have a greater\nwish to talk than you, for I want you to understand me.\"\n\n\"And I want you, Richard,\" said I, shaking my head, \"to understand\nsome one else.\"\n\n\"Since you refer so immediately to John Jarndyce,\" said Richard, \"--I\nsuppose you mean him?\"\n\n\"Of course I do.\"\n\n\"Then I may say at once that I am glad of it, because it is on that\nsubject that I am anxious to be understood. By you, mind--you, my\ndear! I am not accountable to Mr. Jarndyce or Mr. Anybody.\"\n\nI was pained to find him taking this tone, and he observed it.\n\n\"Well, well, my dear,\" said Richard, \"we won't go into that now. I\nwant to appear quietly in your country-house here, with you under my\narm, and give my charming cousin a surprise. I suppose your loyalty\nto John Jarndyce will allow that?\"\n\n\"My dear Richard,\" I returned, \"you know you would be heartily\nwelcome at his house--your home, if you will but consider it so; and\nyou are as heartily welcome here!\"\n\n\"Spoken like the best of little women!\" cried Richard gaily.\n\nI asked him how he liked his profession.\n\n\"Oh, I like it well enough!\" said Richard. \"It's all right. It does\nas well as anything else, for a time. I don't know that I shall care\nabout it when I come to be settled, but I can sell out then\nand--however, never mind all that botheration at present.\"\n\nSo young and handsome, and in all respects so perfectly the opposite\nof Miss Flite! And yet, in the clouded, eager, seeking look that\npassed over him, so dreadfully like her!\n\n\"I am in town on leave just now,\" said Richard.\n\n\"Indeed?\"\n\n\"Yes. I have run over to look after my--my Chancery interests before\nthe long vacation,\" said Richard, forcing a careless laugh. \"We are\nbeginning to spin along with that old suit at last, I promise you.\"\n\nNo wonder that I shook my head!\n\n\"As you say, it's not a pleasant subject.\" Richard spoke with the\nsame shade crossing his face as before. \"Let it go to the four winds\nfor to-night. Puff! Gone! Who do you suppose is with me?\"\n\n\"Was it Mr. Skimpole's voice I heard?\"\n\n\"That's the man! He does me more good than anybody. What a\nfascinating child it is!\"\n\nI asked Richard if any one knew of their coming down together. He\nanswered, no, nobody. He had been to call upon the dear old\ninfant--so he called Mr. Skimpole--and the dear old infant had told\nhim where we were, and he had told the dear old infant he was bent on\ncoming to see us, and the dear old infant had directly wanted to come\ntoo; and so he had brought him. \"And he is worth--not to say his\nsordid expenses--but thrice his weight in gold,\" said Richard. \"He is\nsuch a cheery fellow. No worldliness about him. Fresh and\ngreen-hearted!\"\n\nI certainly did not see the proof of Mr. Skimpole's worldliness in\nhis having his expenses paid by Richard, but I made no remark about\nthat. Indeed, he came in and turned our conversation. He was charmed\nto see me, said he had been shedding delicious tears of joy and\nsympathy at intervals for six weeks on my account, had never been so\nhappy as in hearing of my progress, began to understand the mixture\nof good and evil in the world now, felt that he appreciated health\nthe more when somebody else was ill, didn't know but what it might be\nin the scheme of things that A should squint to make B happier in\nlooking straight or that C should carry a wooden leg to make D better\nsatisfied with his flesh and blood in a silk stocking.\n\n\"My dear Miss Summerson, here is our friend Richard,\" said Mr.\nSkimpole, \"full of the brightest visions of the future, which he\nevokes out of the darkness of Chancery. Now that's delightful, that's\ninspiriting, that's full of poetry! In old times the woods and\nsolitudes were made joyous to the shepherd by the imaginary piping\nand dancing of Pan and the nymphs. This present shepherd, our\npastoral Richard, brightens the dull Inns of Court by making Fortune\nand her train sport through them to the melodious notes of a judgment\nfrom the bench. That's very pleasant, you know! Some ill-conditioned\ngrowling fellow may say to me, 'What's the use of these legal and\nequitable abuses? How do you defend them?' I reply, 'My growling\nfriend, I DON'T defend them, but they are very agreeable to me. There\nis a shepherd--youth, a friend of mine, who transmutes them into\nsomething highly fascinating to my simplicity. I don't say it is for\nthis that they exist--for I am a child among you worldly grumblers,\nand not called upon to account to you or myself for anything--but it\nmay be so.'\"\n\nI began seriously to think that Richard could scarcely have found a\nworse friend than this. It made me uneasy that at such a time when he\nmost required some right principle and purpose he should have this\ncaptivating looseness and putting-off of everything, this airy\ndispensing with all principle and purpose, at his elbow. I thought I\ncould understand how such a nature as my guardian's, experienced in\nthe world and forced to contemplate the miserable evasions and\ncontentions of the family misfortune, found an immense relief in Mr.\nSkimpole's avowal of his weaknesses and display of guileless candour;\nbut I could not satisfy myself that it was as artless as it seemed or\nthat it did not serve Mr. Skimpole's idle turn quite as well as any\nother part, and with less trouble.\n\nThey both walked back with me, and Mr. Skimpole leaving us at the\ngate, I walked softly in with Richard and said, \"Ada, my love, I have\nbrought a gentleman to visit you.\" It was not difficult to read the\nblushing, startled face. She loved him dearly, and he knew it, and I\nknew it. It was a very transparent business, that meeting as cousins\nonly.\n\nI almost mistrusted myself as growing quite wicked in my suspicions,\nbut I was not so sure that Richard loved her dearly. He admired her\nvery much--any one must have done that--and I dare say would have\nrenewed their youthful engagement with great pride and ardour but\nthat he knew how she would respect her promise to my guardian. Still\nI had a tormenting idea that the influence upon him extended even\nhere, that he was postponing his best truth and earnestness in this\nas in all things until Jarndyce and Jarndyce should be off his mind.\nAh me! What Richard would have been without that blight, I never\nshall know now!\n\nHe told Ada, in his most ingenuous way, that he had not come to make\nany secret inroad on the terms she had accepted (rather too\nimplicitly and confidingly, he thought) from Mr. Jarndyce, that he\nhad come openly to see her and to see me and to justify himself for\nthe present terms on which he stood with Mr. Jarndyce. As the dear\nold infant would be with us directly, he begged that I would make an\nappointment for the morning, when he might set himself right through\nthe means of an unreserved conversation with me. I proposed to walk\nwith him in the park at seven o'clock, and this was arranged. Mr.\nSkimpole soon afterwards appeared and made us merry for an hour. He\nparticularly requested to see little Coavinses (meaning Charley) and\ntold her, with a patriarchal air, that he had given her late father\nall the business in his power and that if one of her little brothers\nwould make haste to get set up in the same profession, he hoped he\nshould still be able to put a good deal of employment in his way.\n\n\"For I am constantly being taken in these nets,\" said Mr. Skimpole,\nlooking beamingly at us over a glass of wine-and-water, \"and am\nconstantly being bailed out--like a boat. Or paid off--like a ship's\ncompany. Somebody always does it for me. I can't do it, you know, for\nI never have any money. But somebody does it. I get out by somebody's\nmeans; I am not like the starling; I get out. If you were to ask me\nwho somebody is, upon my word I couldn't tell you. Let us drink to\nsomebody. God bless him!\"\n\nRichard was a little late in the morning, but I had not to wait for\nhim long, and we turned into the park. The air was bright and dewy\nand the sky without a cloud. The birds sang delightfully; the\nsparkles in the fern, the grass, and trees, were exquisite to see;\nthe richness of the woods seemed to have increased twenty-fold since\nyesterday, as if, in the still night when they had looked so\nmassively hushed in sleep, Nature, through all the minute details of\nevery wonderful leaf, had been more wakeful than usual for the glory\nof that day.\n\n\"This is a lovely place,\" said Richard, looking round. \"None of the\njar and discord of law-suits here!\"\n\nBut there was other trouble.\n\n\"I tell you what, my dear girl,\" said Richard, \"when I get affairs in\ngeneral settled, I shall come down here, I think, and rest.\"\n\n\"Would it not be better to rest now?\" I asked.\n\n\"Oh, as to resting NOW,\" said Richard, \"or as to doing anything very\ndefinite NOW, that's not easy. In short, it can't be done; I can't do\nit at least.\"\n\n\"Why not?\" said I.\n\n\"You know why not, Esther. If you were living in an unfinished house,\nliable to have the roof put on or taken off--to be from top to bottom\npulled down or built up--to-morrow, next day, next week, next month,\nnext year--you would find it hard to rest or settle. So do I. Now?\nThere's no now for us suitors.\"\n\nI could almost have believed in the attraction on which my poor\nlittle wandering friend had expatiated when I saw again the darkened\nlook of last night. Terrible to think it had in it also a shade of\nthat unfortunate man who had died.\n\n\"My dear Richard,\" said I, \"this is a bad beginning of our\nconversation.\"\n\n\"I knew you would tell me so, Dame Durden.\"\n\n\"And not I alone, dear Richard. It was not I who cautioned you once\nnever to found a hope or expectation on the family curse.\"\n\n\"There you come back to John Jarndyce!\" said Richard impatiently.\n\"Well! We must approach him sooner or later, for he is the staple of\nwhat I have to say, and it's as well at once. My dear Esther, how can\nyou be so blind? Don't you see that he is an interested party and\nthat it may be very well for him to wish me to know nothing of the\nsuit, and care nothing about it, but that it may not be quite so well\nfor me?\"\n\n\"Oh, Richard,\" I remonstrated, \"is it possible that you can ever have\nseen him and heard him, that you can ever have lived under his roof\nand known him, and can yet breathe, even to me in this solitary place\nwhere there is no one to hear us, such unworthy suspicions?\"\n\nHe reddened deeply, as if his natural generosity felt a pang of\nreproach. He was silent for a little while before he replied in a\nsubdued voice, \"Esther, I am sure you know that I am not a mean\nfellow and that I have some sense of suspicion and distrust being\npoor qualities in one of my years.\"\n\n\"I know it very well,\" said I. \"I am not more sure of anything.\"\n\n\"That's a dear girl,\" retorted Richard, \"and like you, because it\ngives me comfort. I had need to get some scrap of comfort out of all\nthis business, for it's a bad one at the best, as I have no occasion\nto tell you.\"\n\n\"I know perfectly,\" said I. \"I know as well, Richard--what shall I\nsay? as well as you do--that such misconstructions are foreign to\nyour nature. And I know, as well as you know, what so changes it.\"\n\n\"Come, sister, come,\" said Richard a little more gaily, \"you will be\nfair with me at all events. If I have the misfortune to be under that\ninfluence, so has he. If it has a little twisted me, it may have a\nlittle twisted him too. I don't say that he is not an honourable man,\nout of all this complication and uncertainty; I am sure he is. But it\ntaints everybody. You know it taints everybody. You have heard him\nsay so fifty times. Then why should HE escape?\"\n\n\"Because,\" said I, \"his is an uncommon character, and he has\nresolutely kept himself outside the circle, Richard.\"\n\n\"Oh, because and because!\" replied Richard in his vivacious way. \"I\nam not sure, my dear girl, but that it may be wise and specious to\npreserve that outward indifference. It may cause other parties\ninterested to become lax about their interests; and people may die\noff, and points may drag themselves out of memory, and many things\nmay smoothly happen that are convenient enough.\"\n\nI was so touched with pity for Richard that I could not reproach him\nany more, even by a look. I remembered my guardian's gentleness\ntowards his errors and with what perfect freedom from resentment he\nhad spoken of them.\n\n\"Esther,\" Richard resumed, \"you are not to suppose that I have come\nhere to make underhanded charges against John Jarndyce. I have only\ncome to justify myself. What I say is, it was all very well and we\ngot on very well while I was a boy, utterly regardless of this same\nsuit; but as soon as I began to take an interest in it and to look\ninto it, then it was quite another thing. Then John Jarndyce\ndiscovers that Ada and I must break off and that if I don't amend\nthat very objectionable course, I am not fit for her. Now, Esther, I\ndon't mean to amend that very objectionable course: I will not hold\nJohn Jarndyce's favour on those unfair terms of compromise, which he\nhas no right to dictate. Whether it pleases him or displeases him, I\nmust maintain my rights and Ada's. I have been thinking about it a\ngood deal, and this is the conclusion I have come to.\"\n\nPoor dear Richard! He had indeed been thinking about it a good deal.\nHis face, his voice, his manner, all showed that too plainly.\n\n\"So I tell him honourably (you are to know I have written to him\nabout all this) that we are at issue and that we had better be at\nissue openly than covertly. I thank him for his goodwill and his\nprotection, and he goes his road, and I go mine. The fact is, our\nroads are not the same. Under one of the wills in dispute, I should\ntake much more than he. I don't mean to say that it is the one to be\nestablished, but there it is, and it has its chance.\"\n\n\"I have not to learn from you, my dear Richard,\" said I, \"of your\nletter. I had heard of it already without an offended or angry word.\"\n\n\"Indeed?\" replied Richard, softening. \"I am glad I said he was an\nhonourable man, out of all this wretched affair. But I always say\nthat and have never doubted it. Now, my dear Esther, I know these\nviews of mine appear extremely harsh to you, and will to Ada when you\ntell her what has passed between us. But if you had gone into the\ncase as I have, if you had only applied yourself to the papers as I\ndid when I was at Kenge's, if you only knew what an accumulation of\ncharges and counter-charges, and suspicions and cross-suspicions,\nthey involve, you would think me moderate in comparison.\"\n\n\"Perhaps so,\" said I. \"But do you think that, among those many\npapers, there is much truth and justice, Richard?\"\n\n\"There is truth and justice somewhere in the case, Esther--\"\n\n\"Or was once, long ago,\" said I.\n\n\"Is--is--must be somewhere,\" pursued Richard impetuously, \"and must\nbe brought out. To allow Ada to be made a bribe and hush-money of is\nnot the way to bring it out. You say the suit is changing me; John\nJarndyce says it changes, has changed, and will change everybody who\nhas any share in it. Then the greater right I have on my side when I\nresolve to do all I can to bring it to an end.\"\n\n\"All you can, Richard! Do you think that in these many years no\nothers have done all they could? Has the difficulty grown easier\nbecause of so many failures?\"\n\n\"It can't last for ever,\" returned Richard with a fierceness kindling\nin him which again presented to me that last sad reminder. \"I am\nyoung and earnest, and energy and determination have done wonders\nmany a time. Others have only half thrown themselves into it. I\ndevote myself to it. I make it the object of my life.\"\n\n\"Oh, Richard, my dear, so much the worse, so much the worse!\"\n\n\"No, no, no, don't you be afraid for me,\" he returned affectionately.\n\"You're a dear, good, wise, quiet, blessed girl; but you have your\nprepossessions. So I come round to John Jarndyce. I tell you, my good\nEsther, when he and I were on those terms which he found so\nconvenient, we were not on natural terms.\"\n\n\"Are division and animosity your natural terms, Richard?\"\n\n\"No, I don't say that. I mean that all this business puts us on\nunnatural terms, with which natural relations are incompatible. See\nanother reason for urging it on! I may find out when it's over that I\nhave been mistaken in John Jarndyce. My head may be clearer when I am\nfree of it, and I may then agree with what you say to-day. Very well.\nThen I shall acknowledge it and make him reparation.\"\n\nEverything postponed to that imaginary time! Everything held in\nconfusion and indecision until then!\n\n\"Now, my best of confidantes,\" said Richard, \"I want my cousin Ada to\nunderstand that I am not captious, fickle, and wilful about John\nJarndyce, but that I have this purpose and reason at my back. I wish\nto represent myself to her through you, because she has a great\nesteem and respect for her cousin John; and I know you will soften\nthe course I take, even though you disapprove of it; and--and in\nshort,\" said Richard, who had been hesitating through these words,\n\"I--I don't like to represent myself in this litigious, contentious,\ndoubting character to a confiding girl like Ada.\"\n\nI told him that he was more like himself in those latter words than\nin anything he had said yet.\n\n\"Why,\" acknowledged Richard, \"that may be true enough, my love. I\nrather feel it to be so. But I shall be able to give myself fair-play\nby and by. I shall come all right again, then, don't you be afraid.\"\n\nI asked him if this were all he wished me to tell Ada.\n\n\"Not quite,\" said Richard. \"I am bound not to withhold from her that\nJohn Jarndyce answered my letter in his usual manner, addressing me\nas 'My dear Rick,' trying to argue me out of my opinions, and telling\nme that they should make no difference in him. (All very well of\ncourse, but not altering the case.) I also want Ada to know that if I\nsee her seldom just now, I am looking after her interests as well as\nmy own--we two being in the same boat exactly--and that I hope she\nwill not suppose from any flying rumours she may hear that I am at\nall light-headed or imprudent; on the contrary, I am always looking\nforward to the termination of the suit, and always planning in that\ndirection. Being of age now and having taken the step I have taken, I\nconsider myself free from any accountability to John Jarndyce; but\nAda being still a ward of the court, I don't yet ask her to renew our\nengagement. When she is free to act for herself, I shall be myself\nonce more and we shall both be in very different worldly\ncircumstances, I believe. If you tell her all this with the advantage\nof your considerate way, you will do me a very great and a very kind\nservice, my dear Esther; and I shall knock Jarndyce and Jarndyce on\nthe head with greater vigour. Of course I ask for no secrecy at Bleak\nHouse.\"\n\n\"Richard,\" said I, \"you place great confidence in me, but I fear you\nwill not take advice from me?\"\n\n\"It's impossible that I can on this subject, my dear girl. On any\nother, readily.\"\n\nAs if there were any other in his life! As if his whole career and\ncharacter were not being dyed one colour!\n\n\"But I may ask you a question, Richard?\"\n\n\"I think so,\" said he, laughing. \"I don't know who may not, if you\nmay not.\"\n\n\"You say, yourself, you are not leading a very settled life.\"\n\n\"How can I, my dear Esther, with nothing settled!\"\n\n\"Are you in debt again?\"\n\n\"Why, of course I am,\" said Richard, astonished at my simplicity.\n\n\"Is it of course?\"\n\n\"My dear child, certainly. I can't throw myself into an object so\ncompletely without expense. You forget, or perhaps you don't know,\nthat under either of the wills Ada and I take something. It's only a\nquestion between the larger sum and the smaller. I shall be within\nthe mark any way. Bless your heart, my excellent girl,\" said Richard,\nquite amused with me, \"I shall be all right! I shall pull through, my\ndear!\"\n\nI felt so deeply sensible of the danger in which he stood that I\ntried, in Ada's name, in my guardian's, in my own, by every fervent\nmeans that I could think of, to warn him of it and to show him some\nof his mistakes. He received everything I said with patience and\ngentleness, but it all rebounded from him without taking the least\neffect. I could not wonder at this after the reception his\npreoccupied mind had given to my guardian's letter, but I determined\nto try Ada's influence yet.\n\nSo when our walk brought us round to the village again, and I went\nhome to breakfast, I prepared Ada for the account I was going to give\nher and told her exactly what reason we had to dread that Richard was\nlosing himself and scattering his whole life to the winds. It made\nher very unhappy, of course, though she had a far, far greater\nreliance on his correcting his errors than I could have--which was so\nnatural and loving in my dear!--and she presently wrote him this\nlittle letter:\n\n\n   My dearest cousin,\n\n   Esther has told me all you said to her this morning. I\n   write this to repeat most earnestly for myself all that\n   she said to you and to let you know how sure I am that\n   you will sooner or later find our cousin John a pattern\n   of truth, sincerity, and goodness, when you will deeply,\n   deeply grieve to have done him (without intending it) so\n   much wrong.\n\n   I do not quite know how to write what I wish to say next,\n   but I trust you will understand it as I mean it. I have\n   some fears, my dearest cousin, that it may be partly for\n   my sake you are now laying up so much unhappiness for\n   yourself--and if for yourself, for me. In case this should\n   be so, or in case you should entertain much thought of me\n   in what you are doing, I most earnestly entreat and beg\n   you to desist. You can do nothing for my sake that will\n   make me half so happy as for ever turning your back upon\n   the shadow in which we both were born. Do not be angry\n   with me for saying this. Pray, pray, dear Richard, for my\n   sake, and for your own, and in a natural repugnance for\n   that source of trouble which had its share in making us\n   both orphans when we were very young, pray, pray, let it\n   go for ever. We have reason to know by this time that\n   there is no good in it and no hope, that there is nothing\n   to be got from it but sorrow.\n\n   My dearest cousin, it is needless for me to say that you\n   are quite free and that it is very likely you may find\n   some one whom you will love much better than your first\n   fancy. I am quite sure, if you will let me say so, that\n   the object of your choice would greatly prefer to follow\n   your fortunes far and wide, however moderate or poor, and\n   see you happy, doing your duty and pursuing your chosen\n   way, than to have the hope of being, or even to be, very\n   rich with you (if such a thing were possible) at the cost\n   of dragging years of procrastination and anxiety and of\n   your indifference to other aims. You may wonder at my\n   saying this so confidently with so little knowledge or\n   experience, but I know it for a certainty from my own\n   heart.\n\n   Ever, my dearest cousin, your most affectionate\n\n   Ada\n\n\nThis note brought Richard to us very soon, but it made little change\nin him if any. We would fairly try, he said, who was right and who\nwas wrong--he would show us--we should see! He was animated and\nglowing, as if Ada's tenderness had gratified him; but I could only\nhope, with a sigh, that the letter might have some stronger effect\nupon his mind on re-perusal than it assuredly had then.\n\nAs they were to remain with us that day and had taken their places to\nreturn by the coach next morning, I sought an opportunity of speaking\nto Mr. Skimpole. Our out-of-door life easily threw one in my way, and\nI delicately said that there was a responsibility in encouraging\nRichard.\n\n\"Responsibility, my dear Miss Summerson?\" he repeated, catching at\nthe word with the pleasantest smile. \"I am the last man in the world\nfor such a thing. I never was responsible in my life--I can't be.\"\n\n\"I am afraid everybody is obliged to be,\" said I timidly enough, he\nbeing so much older and more clever than I.\n\n\"No, really?\" said Mr. Skimpole, receiving this new light with a most\nagreeable jocularity of surprise. \"But every man's not obliged to be\nsolvent? I am not. I never was. See, my dear Miss Summerson,\" he took\na handful of loose silver and halfpence from his pocket, \"there's so\nmuch money. I have not an idea how much. I have not the power of\ncounting. Call it four and ninepence--call it four pound nine. They\ntell me I owe more than that. I dare say I do. I dare say I owe as\nmuch as good-natured people will let me owe. If they don't stop, why\nshould I? There you have Harold Skimpole in little. If that's\nresponsibility, I am responsible.\"\n\nThe perfect ease of manner with which he put the money up again and\nlooked at me with a smile on his refined face, as if he had been\nmentioning a curious little fact about somebody else, almost made me\nfeel as if he really had nothing to do with it.\n\n\"Now, when you mention responsibility,\" he resumed, \"I am disposed to\nsay that I never had the happiness of knowing any one whom I should\nconsider so refreshingly responsible as yourself. You appear to me\nto be the very touchstone of responsibility. When I see you, my\ndear Miss Summerson, intent upon the perfect working of the whole\nlittle orderly system of which you are the centre, I feel inclined\nto say to myself--in fact I do say to myself very often--THAT'S\nresponsibility!\"\n\nIt was difficult, after this, to explain what I meant; but I\npersisted so far as to say that we all hoped he would check and not\nconfirm Richard in the sanguine views he entertained just then.\n\n\"Most willingly,\" he retorted, \"if I could. But, my dear Miss\nSummerson, I have no art, no disguise. If he takes me by the hand and\nleads me through Westminster Hall in an airy procession after\nfortune, I must go. If he says, 'Skimpole, join the dance!' I must\njoin it. Common sense wouldn't, I know, but I have NO common sense.\"\n\nIt was very unfortunate for Richard, I said.\n\n\"Do you think so!\" returned Mr. Skimpole. \"Don't say that, don't say\nthat. Let us suppose him keeping company with Common Sense--an\nexcellent man--a good deal wrinkled--dreadfully practical--change for\na ten-pound note in every pocket--ruled account-book in his\nhand--say, upon the whole, resembling a tax-gatherer. Our dear\nRichard, sanguine, ardent, overleaping obstacles, bursting with\npoetry like a young bud, says to this highly respectable companion,\n'I see a golden prospect before me; it's very bright, it's very\nbeautiful, it's very joyous; here I go, bounding over the landscape\nto come at it!' The respectable companion instantly knocks him down\nwith the ruled account-book; tells him in a literal, prosaic way that\nhe sees no such thing; shows him it's nothing but fees, fraud,\nhorsehair wigs, and black gowns. Now you know that's a painful\nchange--sensible in the last degree, I have no doubt, but\ndisagreeable. I can't do it. I haven't got the ruled account-book, I\nhave none of the tax-gathering elements in my composition, I am not\nat all respectable, and I don't want to be. Odd perhaps, but so it\nis!\"\n\nIt was idle to say more, so I proposed that we should join Ada and\nRichard, who were a little in advance, and I gave up Mr. Skimpole in\ndespair. He had been over the Hall in the course of the morning and\nwhimsically described the family pictures as we walked. There were\nsuch portentous shepherdesses among the Ladies Dedlock dead and gone,\nhe told us, that peaceful crooks became weapons of assault in their\nhands. They tended their flocks severely in buckram and powder and\nput their sticking-plaster patches on to terrify commoners as the\nchiefs of some other tribes put on their war-paint. There was a Sir\nSomebody Dedlock, with a battle, a sprung-mine, volumes of smoke,\nflashes of lightning, a town on fire, and a stormed fort, all in full\naction between his horse's two hind legs, showing, he supposed, how\nlittle a Dedlock made of such trifles. The whole race he represented\nas having evidently been, in life, what he called \"stuffed people\"--a\nlarge collection, glassy eyed, set up in the most approved manner on\ntheir various twigs and perches, very correct, perfectly free from\nanimation, and always in glass cases.\n\nI was not so easy now during any reference to the name but that I\nfelt it a relief when Richard, with an exclamation of surprise,\nhurried away to meet a stranger whom he first descried coming slowly\ntowards us.\n\n\"Dear me!\" said Mr. Skimpole. \"Vholes!\"\n\nWe asked if that were a friend of Richard's.\n\n\"Friend and legal adviser,\" said Mr. Skimpole. \"Now, my dear Miss\nSummerson, if you want common sense, responsibility, and\nrespectability, all united--if you want an exemplary man--Vholes is\nTHE man.\"\n\nWe had not known, we said, that Richard was assisted by any gentleman\nof that name.\n\n\"When he emerged from legal infancy,\" returned Mr. Skimpole, \"he\nparted from our conversational friend Kenge and took up, I believe,\nwith Vholes. Indeed, I know he did, because I introduced him to\nVholes.\"\n\n\"Had you known him long?\" asked Ada.\n\n\"Vholes? My dear Miss Clare, I had had that kind of acquaintance with\nhim which I have had with several gentlemen of his profession. He had\ndone something or other in a very agreeable, civil manner--taken\nproceedings, I think, is the expression--which ended in the\nproceeding of his taking ME. Somebody was so good as to step in and\npay the money--something and fourpence was the amount; I forget the\npounds and shillings, but I know it ended with fourpence, because it\nstruck me at the time as being so odd that I could owe anybody\nfourpence--and after that I brought them together. Vholes asked me\nfor the introduction, and I gave it. Now I come to think of it,\" he\nlooked inquiringly at us with his frankest smile as he made the\ndiscovery, \"Vholes bribed me, perhaps? He gave me something and\ncalled it commission. Was it a five-pound note? Do you know, I think\nit MUST have been a five-pound note!\"\n\nHis further consideration of the point was prevented by Richard's\ncoming back to us in an excited state and hastily representing Mr.\nVholes--a sallow man with pinched lips that looked as if they were\ncold, a red eruption here and there upon his face, tall and thin,\nabout fifty years of age, high-shouldered, and stooping. Dressed in\nblack, black-gloved, and buttoned to the chin, there was nothing so\nremarkable in him as a lifeless manner and a slow, fixed way he had\nof looking at Richard.\n\n\"I hope I don't disturb you, ladies,\" said Mr. Vholes, and now I\nobserved that he was further remarkable for an inward manner of\nspeaking. \"I arranged with Mr. Carstone that he should always know\nwhen his cause was in the Chancellor's paper, and being informed by\none of my clerks last night after post time that it stood, rather\nunexpectedly, in the paper for to-morrow, I put myself into the coach\nearly this morning and came down to confer with him.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Richard, flushed, and looking triumphantly at Ada and me,\n\"we don't do these things in the old slow way now. We spin along now!\nMr. Vholes, we must hire something to get over to the post town in,\nand catch the mail to-night, and go up by it!\"\n\n\"Anything you please, sir,\" returned Mr. Vholes. \"I am quite at your\nservice.\"\n\n\"Let me see,\" said Richard, looking at his watch. \"If I run down to\nthe Dedlock, and get my portmanteau fastened up, and order a gig, or\na chaise, or whatever's to be got, we shall have an hour then before\nstarting. I'll come back to tea. Cousin Ada, will you and Esther take\ncare of Mr. Vholes when I am gone?\"\n\nHe was away directly, in his heat and hurry, and was soon lost in the\ndusk of evening. We who were left walked on towards the house.\n\n\"Is Mr. Carstone's presence necessary to-morrow, Sir?\" said I. \"Can\nit do any good?\"\n\n\"No, miss,\" Mr. Vholes replied. \"I am not aware that it can.\"\n\nBoth Ada and I expressed our regret that he should go, then, only to\nbe disappointed.\n\n\"Mr. Carstone has laid down the principle of watching his own\ninterests,\" said Mr. Vholes, \"and when a client lays down his own\nprinciple, and it is not immoral, it devolves upon me to carry it\nout. I wish in business to be exact and open. I am a widower with\nthree daughters--Emma, Jane, and Caroline--and my desire is so to\ndischarge the duties of life as to leave them a good name. This\nappears to be a pleasant spot, miss.\"\n\nThe remark being made to me in consequence of my being next him as we\nwalked, I assented and enumerated its chief attractions.\n\n\"Indeed?\" said Mr. Vholes. \"I have the privilege of supporting an\naged father in the Vale of Taunton--his native place--and I admire\nthat country very much. I had no idea there was anything so\nattractive here.\"\n\nTo keep up the conversation, I asked Mr. Vholes if he would like to\nlive altogether in the country.\n\n\"There, miss,\" said he, \"you touch me on a tender string. My health\nis not good (my digestion being much impaired), and if I had only\nmyself to consider, I should take refuge in rural habits, especially\nas the cares of business have prevented me from ever coming much into\ncontact with general society, and particularly with ladies' society,\nwhich I have most wished to mix in. But with my three daughters,\nEmma, Jane, and Caroline--and my aged father--I cannot afford to be\nselfish. It is true I have no longer to maintain a dear grandmother\nwho died in her hundred and second year, but enough remains to render\nit indispensable that the mill should be always going.\"\n\nIt required some attention to hear him on account of his inward\nspeaking and his lifeless manner.\n\n\"You will excuse my having mentioned my daughters,\" he said. \"They\nare my weak point. I wish to leave the poor girls some little\nindependence, as well as a good name.\"\n\nWe now arrived at Mr. Boythorn's house, where the tea-table, all\nprepared, was awaiting us. Richard came in restless and hurried\nshortly afterwards, and leaning over Mr. Vholes's chair, whispered\nsomething in his ear. Mr. Vholes replied aloud--or as nearly aloud I\nsuppose as he had ever replied to anything--\"You will drive me, will\nyou, sir? It is all the same to me, sir. Anything you please. I am\nquite at your service.\"\n\nWe understood from what followed that Mr. Skimpole was to be left\nuntil the morning to occupy the two places which had been already\npaid for. As Ada and I were both in low spirits concerning Richard\nand very sorry so to part with him, we made it as plain as we\npolitely could that we should leave Mr. Skimpole to the Dedlock Arms\nand retire when the night-travellers were gone.\n\nRichard's high spirits carrying everything before them, we all went\nout together to the top of the hill above the village, where he had\nordered a gig to wait and where we found a man with a lantern\nstanding at the head of the gaunt pale horse that had been harnessed\nto it.\n\nI never shall forget those two seated side by side in the lantern's\nlight, Richard all flush and fire and laughter, with the reins in his\nhand; Mr. Vholes quite still, black-gloved, and buttoned up, looking\nat him as if he were looking at his prey and charming it. I have\nbefore me the whole picture of the warm dark night, the summer\nlightning, the dusty track of road closed in by hedgerows and high\ntrees, the gaunt pale horse with his ears pricked up, and the driving\naway at speed to Jarndyce and Jarndyce.\n\nMy dear girl told me that night how Richard's being thereafter\nprosperous or ruined, befriended or deserted, could only make this\ndifference to her, that the more he needed love from one unchanging\nheart, the more love that unchanging heart would have to give him;\nhow he thought of her through his present errors, and she would think\nof him at all times--never of herself if she could devote herself to\nhim, never of her own delights if she could minister to his.\n\nAnd she kept her word?\n\nI look along the road before me, where the distance already shortens\nand the journey's end is growing visible; and true and good above the\ndead sea of the Chancery suit and all the ashy fruit it cast ashore,\nI think I see my darling.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXVIII\n\nA Struggle\n\n\nWhen our time came for returning to Bleak House again, we were\npunctual to the day and were received with an overpowering welcome. I\nwas perfectly restored to health and strength, and finding my\nhousekeeping keys laid ready for me in my room, rang myself in as if\nI had been a new year, with a merry little peal. \"Once more, duty,\nduty, Esther,\" said I; \"and if you are not overjoyed to do it, more\nthan cheerfully and contentedly, through anything and everything, you\nought to be. That's all I have to say to you, my dear!\"\n\nThe first few mornings were mornings of so much bustle and business,\ndevoted to such settlements of accounts, such repeated journeys to\nand fro between the growlery and all other parts of the house, so\nmany rearrangements of drawers and presses, and such a general new\nbeginning altogether, that I had not a moment's leisure. But when\nthese arrangements were completed and everything was in order, I paid\na visit of a few hours to London, which something in the letter I had\ndestroyed at Chesney Wold had induced me to decide upon in my own\nmind.\n\nI made Caddy Jellyby--her maiden name was so natural to me that I\nalways called her by it--the pretext for this visit and wrote her a\nnote previously asking the favour of her company on a little business\nexpedition. Leaving home very early in the morning, I got to London\nby stage-coach in such good time that I got to Newman Street with the\nday before me.\n\nCaddy, who had not seen me since her wedding-day, was so glad and so\naffectionate that I was half inclined to fear I should make her\nhusband jealous. But he was, in his way, just as bad--I mean as good;\nand in short it was the old story, and nobody would leave me any\npossibility of doing anything meritorious.\n\nThe elder Mr. Turveydrop was in bed, I found, and Caddy was\nmilling his chocolate, which a melancholy little boy who was an\napprentice--it seemed such a curious thing to be apprenticed to the\ntrade of dancing--was waiting to carry upstairs. Her father-in-law\nwas extremely kind and considerate, Caddy told me, and they lived\nmost happily together. (When she spoke of their living together, she\nmeant that the old gentleman had all the good things and all the good\nlodging, while she and her husband had what they could get, and were\npoked into two corner rooms over the Mews.)\n\n\"And how is your mama, Caddy?\" said I.\n\n\"Why, I hear of her, Esther,\" replied Caddy, \"through Pa, but I see\nvery little of her. We are good friends, I am glad to say, but Ma\nthinks there is something absurd in my having married a\ndancing-master, and she is rather afraid of its extending to her.\"\n\nIt struck me that if Mrs. Jellyby had discharged her own natural\nduties and obligations before she swept the horizon with a telescope\nin search of others, she would have taken the best precautions\nagainst becoming absurd, but I need scarcely observe that I kept this\nto myself.\n\n\"And your papa, Caddy?\"\n\n\"He comes here every evening,\" returned Caddy, \"and is so fond of\nsitting in the corner there that it's a treat to see him.\"\n\nLooking at the corner, I plainly perceived the mark of Mr. Jellyby's\nhead against the wall. It was consolatory to know that he had found\nsuch a resting-place for it.\n\n\"And you, Caddy,\" said I, \"you are always busy, I'll be bound?\"\n\n\"Well, my dear,\" returned Caddy, \"I am indeed, for to tell you a\ngrand secret, I am qualifying myself to give lessons. Prince's health\nis not strong, and I want to be able to assist him. What with\nschools, and classes here, and private pupils, AND the apprentices,\nhe really has too much to do, poor fellow!\"\n\nThe notion of the apprentices was still so odd to me that I asked\nCaddy if there were many of them.\n\n\"Four,\" said Caddy. \"One in-door, and three out. They are\nvery good children; only when they get together they WILL\nplay--children-like--instead of attending to their work. So the\nlittle boy you saw just now waltzes by himself in the empty kitchen,\nand we distribute the others over the house as well as we can.\"\n\n\"That is only for their steps, of course?\" said I.\n\n\"Only for their steps,\" said Caddy. \"In that way they practise, so\nmany hours at a time, whatever steps they happen to be upon. They\ndance in the academy, and at this time of year we do figures at five\nevery morning.\"\n\n\"Why, what a laborious life!\" I exclaimed.\n\n\"I assure you, my dear,\" returned Caddy, smiling, \"when the out-door\napprentices ring us up in the morning (the bell rings into our room,\nnot to disturb old Mr. Turveydrop), and when I put up the window and\nsee them standing on the door-step with their little pumps under\ntheir arms, I am actually reminded of the Sweeps.\"\n\nAll this presented the art to me in a singular light, to be sure.\nCaddy enjoyed the effect of her communication and cheerfully\nrecounted the particulars of her own studies.\n\n\"You see, my dear, to save expense I ought to know something of the\npiano, and I ought to know something of the kit too, and consequently\nI have to practise those two instruments as well as the details of\nour profession. If Ma had been like anybody else, I might have had\nsome little musical knowledge to begin upon. However, I hadn't any;\nand that part of the work is, at first, a little discouraging, I must\nallow. But I have a very good ear, and I am used to drudgery--I have\nto thank Ma for that, at all events--and where there's a will there's\na way, you know, Esther, the world over.\" Saying these words, Caddy\nlaughingly sat down at a little jingling square piano and really\nrattled off a quadrille with great spirit. Then she good-humouredly\nand blushingly got up again, and while she still laughed herself,\nsaid, \"Don't laugh at me, please; that's a dear girl!\"\n\nI would sooner have cried, but I did neither. I encouraged her and\npraised her with all my heart. For I conscientiously believed,\ndancing-master's wife though she was, and dancing-mistress though in\nher limited ambition she aspired to be, she had struck out a natural,\nwholesome, loving course of industry and perseverance that was quite\nas good as a mission.\n\n\"My dear,\" said Caddy, delighted, \"you can't think how you cheer me.\nI shall owe you, you don't know how much. What changes, Esther, even\nin my small world! You recollect that first night, when I was so\nunpolite and inky? Who would have thought, then, of my ever teaching\npeople to dance, of all other possibilities and impossibilities!\"\n\nHer husband, who had left us while we had this chat, now coming back,\npreparatory to exercising the apprentices in the ball-room, Caddy\ninformed me she was quite at my disposal. But it was not my time yet,\nI was glad to tell her, for I should have been vexed to take her away\nthen. Therefore we three adjourned to the apprentices together, and I\nmade one in the dance.\n\nThe apprentices were the queerest little people. Besides the\nmelancholy boy, who, I hoped, had not been made so by waltzing alone\nin the empty kitchen, there were two other boys and one dirty little\nlimp girl in a gauzy dress. Such a precocious little girl, with such\na dowdy bonnet on (that, too, of a gauzy texture), who brought her\nsandalled shoes in an old threadbare velvet reticule. Such mean\nlittle boys, when they were not dancing, with string, and marbles,\nand cramp-bones in their pockets, and the most untidy legs and\nfeet--and heels particularly.\n\nI asked Caddy what had made their parents choose this profession for\nthem. Caddy said she didn't know; perhaps they were designed for\nteachers, perhaps for the stage. They were all people in humble\ncircumstances, and the melancholy boy's mother kept a ginger-beer\nshop.\n\nWe danced for an hour with great gravity, the melancholy child doing\nwonders with his lower extremities, in which there appeared to be\nsome sense of enjoyment though it never rose above his waist. Caddy,\nwhile she was observant of her husband and was evidently founded upon\nhim, had acquired a grace and self-possession of her own, which,\nunited to her pretty face and figure, was uncommonly agreeable. She\nalready relieved him of much of the instruction of these young\npeople, and he seldom interfered except to walk his part in the\nfigure if he had anything to do in it. He always played the tune. The\naffectation of the gauzy child, and her condescension to the boys,\nwas a sight. And thus we danced an hour by the clock.\n\nWhen the practice was concluded, Caddy's husband made himself ready\nto go out of town to a school, and Caddy ran away to get ready to go\nout with me. I sat in the ball-room in the interval, contemplating\nthe apprentices. The two out-door boys went upon the staircase to put\non their half-boots and pull the in-door boy's hair, as I judged from\nthe nature of his objections. Returning with their jackets buttoned\nand their pumps stuck in them, they then produced packets of cold\nbread and meat and bivouacked under a painted lyre on the wall. The\nlittle gauzy child, having whisked her sandals into the reticule and\nput on a trodden-down pair of shoes, shook her head into the dowdy\nbonnet at one shake, and answering my inquiry whether she liked\ndancing by replying, \"Not with boys,\" tied it across her chin, and\nwent home contemptuous.\n\n\"Old Mr. Turveydrop is so sorry,\" said Caddy, \"that he has not\nfinished dressing yet and cannot have the pleasure of seeing you\nbefore you go. You are such a favourite of his, Esther.\"\n\nI expressed myself much obliged to him, but did not think it\nnecessary to add that I readily dispensed with this attention.\n\n\"It takes him a long time to dress,\" said Caddy, \"because he is very\nmuch looked up to in such things, you know, and has a reputation to\nsupport. You can't think how kind he is to Pa. He talks to Pa of an\nevening about the Prince Regent, and I never saw Pa so interested.\"\n\nThere was something in the picture of Mr. Turveydrop bestowing his\ndeportment on Mr. Jellyby that quite took my fancy. I asked Caddy if\nhe brought her papa out much.\n\n\"No,\" said Caddy, \"I don't know that he does that, but he talks to\nPa, and Pa greatly admires him, and listens, and likes it. Of course\nI am aware that Pa has hardly any claims to deportment, but they get\non together delightfully. You can't think what good companions they\nmake. I never saw Pa take snuff before in my life, but he takes one\npinch out of Mr. Turveydrop's box regularly and keeps putting it to\nhis nose and taking it away again all the evening.\"\n\nThat old Mr. Turveydrop should ever, in the chances and changes of\nlife, have come to the rescue of Mr. Jellyby from Borrioboola-Gha\nappeared to me to be one of the pleasantest of oddities.\n\n\"As to Peepy,\" said Caddy with a little hesitation, \"whom I was most\nafraid of--next to having any family of my own, Esther--as an\ninconvenience to Mr. Turveydrop, the kindness of the old gentleman to\nthat child is beyond everything. He asks to see him, my dear! He lets\nhim take the newspaper up to him in bed; he gives him the crusts of\nhis toast to eat; he sends him on little errands about the house; he\ntells him to come to me for sixpences. In short,\" said Caddy\ncheerily, \"and not to prose, I am a very fortunate girl and ought to\nbe very grateful. Where are we going, Esther?\"\n\n\"To the Old Street Road,\" said I, \"where I have a few words to say to\nthe solicitor's clerk who was sent to meet me at the coach-office on\nthe very day when I came to London and first saw you, my dear. Now I\nthink of it, the gentleman who brought us to your house.\"\n\n\"Then, indeed, I seem to be naturally the person to go with you,\"\nreturned Caddy.\n\nTo the Old Street Road we went and there inquired at Mrs. Guppy's\nresidence for Mrs. Guppy. Mrs. Guppy, occupying the parlours and\nhaving indeed been visibly in danger of cracking herself like a nut\nin the front-parlour door by peeping out before she was asked for,\nimmediately presented herself and requested us to walk in. She was an\nold lady in a large cap, with rather a red nose and rather an\nunsteady eye, but smiling all over. Her close little sitting-room was\nprepared for a visit, and there was a portrait of her son in it\nwhich, I had almost written here, was more like than life: it\ninsisted upon him with such obstinacy, and was so determined not to\nlet him off.\n\nNot only was the portrait there, but we found the original there too.\nHe was dressed in a great many colours and was discovered at a table\nreading law-papers with his forefinger to his forehead.\n\n\"Miss Summerson,\" said Mr. Guppy, rising, \"this is indeed an oasis.\nMother, will you be so good as to put a chair for the other lady and\nget out of the gangway.\"\n\nMrs. Guppy, whose incessant smiling gave her quite a waggish\nappearance, did as her son requested and then sat down in a corner,\nholding her pocket handkerchief to her chest, like a fomentation,\nwith both hands.\n\nI presented Caddy, and Mr. Guppy said that any friend of mine was\nmore than welcome. I then proceeded to the object of my visit.\n\n\"I took the liberty of sending you a note, sir,\" said I.\n\nMr. Guppy acknowledged the receipt by taking it out of his\nbreast-pocket, putting it to his lips, and returning it to his pocket\nwith a bow. Mr. Guppy's mother was so diverted that she rolled her\nhead as she smiled and made a silent appeal to Caddy with her elbow.\n\n\"Could I speak to you alone for a moment?\" said I.\n\nAnything like the jocoseness of Mr. Guppy's mother just now, I think\nI never saw. She made no sound of laughter, but she rolled her head,\nand shook it, and put her handkerchief to her mouth, and appealed to\nCaddy with her elbow, and her hand, and her shoulder, and was so\nunspeakably entertained altogether that it was with some difficulty\nshe could marshal Caddy through the little folding-door into her\nbedroom adjoining.\n\n\"Miss Summerson,\" said Mr. Guppy, \"you will excuse the waywardness of\na parent ever mindful of a son's appiness. My mother, though highly\nexasperating to the feelings, is actuated by maternal dictates.\"\n\nI could hardly have believed that anybody could in a moment have\nturned so red or changed so much as Mr. Guppy did when I now put up\nmy veil.\n\n\"I asked the favour of seeing you for a few moments here,\" said I,\n\"in preference to calling at Mr. Kenge's because, remembering what\nyou said on an occasion when you spoke to me in confidence, I feared\nI might otherwise cause you some embarrassment, Mr. Guppy.\"\n\nI caused him embarrassment enough as it was, I am sure. I never saw\nsuch faltering, such confusion, such amazement and apprehension.\n\n\"Miss Summerson,\" stammered Mr. Guppy, \"I--I--beg your pardon, but in\nour profession--we--we--find it necessary to be explicit. You have\nreferred to an occasion, miss, when I--when I did myself the honour\nof making a declaration which--\"\n\nSomething seemed to rise in his throat that he could not possibly\nswallow. He put his hand there, coughed, made faces, tried again to\nswallow it, coughed again, made faces again, looked all round the\nroom, and fluttered his papers.\n\n\"A kind of giddy sensation has come upon me, miss,\" he explained,\n\"which rather knocks me over. I--er--a little subject to this sort of\nthing--er--by George!\"\n\nI gave him a little time to recover. He consumed it in putting his\nhand to his forehead and taking it away again, and in backing his\nchair into the corner behind him.\n\n\"My intention was to remark, miss,\" said Mr. Guppy, \"dear\nme--something bronchial, I think--hem!--to remark that you was so\ngood on that occasion as to repel and repudiate that declaration.\nYou--you wouldn't perhaps object to admit that? Though no witnesses\nare present, it might be a satisfaction to--to your mind--if you was\nto put in that admission.\"\n\n\"There can be no doubt,\" said I, \"that I declined your proposal\nwithout any reservation or qualification whatever, Mr. Guppy.\"\n\n\"Thank you, miss,\" he returned, measuring the table with his troubled\nhands. \"So far that's satisfactory, and it does you credit. Er--this\nis certainly bronchial!--must be in the tubes--er--you wouldn't\nperhaps be offended if I was to mention--not that it's necessary, for\nyour own good sense or any person's sense must show 'em that--if I\nwas to mention that such declaration on my part was final, and there\nterminated?\"\n\n\"I quite understand that,\" said I.\n\n\"Perhaps--er--it may not be worth the form, but it might be a\nsatisfaction to your mind--perhaps you wouldn't object to admit that,\nmiss?\" said Mr. Guppy.\n\n\"I admit it most fully and freely,\" said I.\n\n\"Thank you,\" returned Mr. Guppy. \"Very honourable, I am sure. I\nregret that my arrangements in life, combined with circumstances over\nwhich I have no control, will put it out of my power ever to fall\nback upon that offer or to renew it in any shape or form whatever,\nbut it will ever be a retrospect entwined--er--with friendship's\nbowers.\" Mr. Guppy's bronchitis came to his relief and stopped his\nmeasurement of the table.\n\n\"I may now perhaps mention what I wished to say to you?\" I began.\n\n\"I shall be honoured, I am sure,\" said Mr. Guppy. \"I am so persuaded\nthat your own good sense and right feeling, miss, will--will keep you\nas square as possible--that I can have nothing but pleasure, I am\nsure, in hearing any observations you may wish to offer.\"\n\n\"You were so good as to imply, on that occasion--\"\n\n\"Excuse me, miss,\" said Mr. Guppy, \"but we had better not travel out\nof the record into implication. I cannot admit that I implied\nanything.\"\n\n\"You said on that occasion,\" I recommenced, \"that you might possibly\nhave the means of advancing my interests and promoting my fortunes by\nmaking discoveries of which I should be the subject. I presume that\nyou founded that belief upon your general knowledge of my being an\norphan girl, indebted for everything to the benevolence of Mr.\nJarndyce. Now, the beginning and the end of what I have come to beg\nof you is, Mr. Guppy, that you will have the kindness to relinquish\nall idea of so serving me. I have thought of this sometimes, and I\nhave thought of it most lately--since I have been ill. At length I\nhave decided, in case you should at any time recall that purpose and\nact upon it in any way, to come to you and assure you that you are\naltogether mistaken. You could make no discovery in reference to me\nthat would do me the least service or give me the least pleasure. I\nam acquainted with my personal history, and I have it in my power to\nassure you that you never can advance my welfare by such means. You\nmay, perhaps, have abandoned this project a long time. If so, excuse\nmy giving you unnecessary trouble. If not, I entreat you, on the\nassurance I have given you, henceforth to lay it aside. I beg you to\ndo this, for my peace.\"\n\n\"I am bound to confess,\" said Mr. Guppy, \"that you express yourself,\nmiss, with that good sense and right feeling for which I gave you\ncredit. Nothing can be more satisfactory than such right feeling, and\nif I mistook any intentions on your part just now, I am prepared to\ntender a full apology. I should wish to be understood, miss, as\nhereby offering that apology--limiting it, as your own good sense and\nright feeling will point out the necessity of, to the present\nproceedings.\"\n\nI must say for Mr. Guppy that the snuffling manner he had had upon\nhim improved very much. He seemed truly glad to be able to do\nsomething I asked, and he looked ashamed.\n\n\"If you will allow me to finish what I have to say at once so that I\nmay have no occasion to resume,\" I went on, seeing him about to\nspeak, \"you will do me a kindness, sir. I come to you as privately as\npossible because you announced this impression of yours to me in a\nconfidence which I have really wished to respect--and which I always\nhave respected, as you remember. I have mentioned my illness. There\nreally is no reason why I should hesitate to say that I know very\nwell that any little delicacy I might have had in making a request to\nyou is quite removed. Therefore I make the entreaty I have now\npreferred, and I hope you will have sufficient consideration for me\nto accede to it.\"\n\nI must do Mr. Guppy the further justice of saying that he had looked\nmore and more ashamed and that he looked most ashamed and very\nearnest when he now replied with a burning face, \"Upon my word and\nhonour, upon my life, upon my soul, Miss Summerson, as I am a living\nman, I'll act according to your wish! I'll never go another step in\nopposition to it. I'll take my oath to it if it will be any\nsatisfaction to you. In what I promise at this present time touching\nthe matters now in question,\" continued Mr. Guppy rapidly, as if he\nwere repeating a familiar form of words, \"I speak the truth, the\nwhole truth, and nothing but the truth, so--\"\n\n\"I am quite satisfied,\" said I, rising at this point, \"and I thank\nyou very much. Caddy, my dear, I am ready!\"\n\nMr. Guppy's mother returned with Caddy (now making me the recipient\nof her silent laughter and her nudges), and we took our leave. Mr.\nGuppy saw us to the door with the air of one who was either\nimperfectly awake or walking in his sleep; and we left him there,\nstaring.\n\nBut in a minute he came after us down the street without any hat, and\nwith his long hair all blown about, and stopped us, saying fervently,\n\"Miss Summerson, upon my honour and soul, you may depend upon me!\"\n\n\"I do,\" said I, \"quite confidently.\"\n\n\"I beg your pardon, miss,\" said Mr. Guppy, going with one leg and\nstaying with the other, \"but this lady being present--your own\nwitness--it might be a satisfaction to your mind (which I should wish\nto set at rest) if you was to repeat those admissions.\"\n\n\"Well, Caddy,\" said I, turning to her, \"perhaps you will not be\nsurprised when I tell you, my dear, that there never has been any\nengagement--\"\n\n\"No proposal or promise of marriage whatsoever,\" suggested Mr. Guppy.\n\n\"No proposal or promise of marriage whatsoever,\" said I, \"between\nthis gentleman--\"\n\n\"William Guppy, of Penton Place, Pentonville, in the county of\nMiddlesex,\" he murmured.\n\n\"Between this gentleman, Mr. William Guppy, of Penton Place,\nPentonville, in the county of Middlesex, and myself.\"\n\n\"Thank you, miss,\" said Mr. Guppy. \"Very full--er--excuse me--lady's\nname, Christian and surname both?\"\n\nI gave them.\n\n\"Married woman, I believe?\" said Mr. Guppy. \"Married woman. Thank\nyou. Formerly Caroline Jellyby, spinster, then of Thavies Inn, within\nthe city of London, but extra-parochial; now of Newman Street, Oxford\nStreet. Much obliged.\"\n\nHe ran home and came running back again.\n\n\"Touching that matter, you know, I really and truly am very sorry\nthat my arrangements in life, combined with circumstances over which\nI have no control, should prevent a renewal of what was wholly\nterminated some time back,\" said Mr. Guppy to me forlornly and\ndespondently, \"but it couldn't be. Now COULD it, you know! I only put\nit to you.\"\n\nI replied it certainly could not. The subject did not admit of a\ndoubt. He thanked me and ran to his mother's again--and back again.\n\n\"It's very honourable of you, miss, I am sure,\" said Mr. Guppy. \"If\nan altar could be erected in the bowers of friendship--but, upon my\nsoul, you may rely upon me in every respect save and except the\ntender passion only!\"\n\nThe struggle in Mr. Guppy's breast and the numerous oscillations it\noccasioned him between his mother's door and us were sufficiently\nconspicuous in the windy street (particularly as his hair wanted\ncutting) to make us hurry away. I did so with a lightened heart; but\nwhen we last looked back, Mr. Guppy was still oscillating in the same\ntroubled state of mind.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXIX\n\nAttorney and Client\n\n\nThe name of Mr. Vholes, preceded by the legend Ground-Floor, is\ninscribed upon a door-post in Symond's Inn, Chancery Lane--a little,\npale, wall-eyed, woebegone inn like a large dust-binn of two\ncompartments and a sifter. It looks as if Symond were a sparing man\nin his way and constructed his inn of old building materials which\ntook kindly to the dry rot and to dirt and all things decaying and\ndismal, and perpetuated Symond's memory with congenial shabbiness.\nQuartered in this dingy hatchment commemorative of Symond are the\nlegal bearings of Mr. Vholes.\n\nMr. Vholes's office, in disposition retiring and in situation\nretired, is squeezed up in a corner and blinks at a dead wall. Three\nfeet of knotty-floored dark passage bring the client to Mr. Vholes's\njet-black door, in an angle profoundly dark on the brightest\nmidsummer morning and encumbered by a black bulk-head of cellarage\nstaircase against which belated civilians generally strike their\nbrows. Mr. Vholes's chambers are on so small a scale that one clerk\ncan open the door without getting off his stool, while the other who\nelbows him at the same desk has equal facilities for poking the fire.\nA smell as of unwholesome sheep blending with the smell of must and\ndust is referable to the nightly (and often daily) consumption of\nmutton fat in candles and to the fretting of parchment forms and\nskins in greasy drawers. The atmosphere is otherwise stale and close.\nThe place was last painted or whitewashed beyond the memory of man,\nand the two chimneys smoke, and there is a loose outer surface of\nsoot everywhere, and the dull cracked windows in their heavy frames\nhave but one piece of character in them, which is a determination to\nbe always dirty and always shut unless coerced. This accounts for the\nphenomenon of the weaker of the two usually having a bundle of\nfirewood thrust between its jaws in hot weather.\n\nMr. Vholes is a very respectable man. He has not a large business,\nbut he is a very respectable man. He is allowed by the greater\nattorneys who have made good fortunes or are making them to be a most\nrespectable man. He never misses a chance in his practice, which is a\nmark of respectability. He never takes any pleasure, which is another\nmark of respectability. He is reserved and serious, which is another\nmark of respectability. His digestion is impaired, which is highly\nrespectable. And he is making hay of the grass which is flesh, for\nhis three daughters. And his father is dependent on him in the Vale\nof Taunton.\n\nThe one great principle of the English law is to make business for\nitself. There is no other principle distinctly, certainly, and\nconsistently maintained through all its narrow turnings. Viewed by\nthis light it becomes a coherent scheme and not the monstrous maze\nthe laity are apt to think it. Let them but once clearly perceive\nthat its grand principle is to make business for itself at their\nexpense, and surely they will cease to grumble.\n\nBut not perceiving this quite plainly--only seeing it by halves in a\nconfused way--the laity sometimes suffer in peace and pocket, with a\nbad grace, and DO grumble very much. Then this respectability of Mr.\nVholes is brought into powerful play against them. \"Repeal this\nstatute, my good sir?\" says Mr. Kenge to a smarting client. \"Repeal\nit, my dear sir? Never, with my consent. Alter this law, sir, and\nwhat will be the effect of your rash proceeding on a class of\npractitioners very worthily represented, allow me to say to you, by\nthe opposite attorney in the case, Mr. Vholes? Sir, that class of\npractitioners would be swept from the face of the earth. Now you\ncannot afford--I will say, the social system cannot afford--to lose\nan order of men like Mr. Vholes. Diligent, persevering, steady, acute\nin business. My dear sir, I understand your present feelings against\nthe existing state of things, which I grant to be a little hard in\nyour case; but I can never raise my voice for the demolition of a\nclass of men like Mr. Vholes.\" The respectability of Mr. Vholes has\neven been cited with crushing effect before Parliamentary committees,\nas in the following blue minutes of a distinguished attorney's\nevidence. \"Question (number five hundred and seventeen thousand eight\nhundred and sixty-nine): If I understand you, these forms of practice\nindisputably occasion delay? Answer: Yes, some delay. Question: And\ngreat expense? Answer: Most assuredly they cannot be gone through for\nnothing. Question: And unspeakable vexation? Answer: I am not\nprepared to say that. They have never given ME any vexation; quite\nthe contrary. Question: But you think that their abolition would\ndamage a class of practitioners? Answer: I have no doubt of it.\nQuestion: Can you instance any type of that class? Answer: Yes. I\nwould unhesitatingly mention Mr. Vholes. He would be ruined.\nQuestion: Mr. Vholes is considered, in the profession, a respectable\nman? Answer:\"--which proved fatal to the inquiry for ten years--\"Mr.\nVholes is considered, in the profession, a MOST respectable man.\"\n\nSo in familiar conversation, private authorities no less\ndisinterested will remark that they don't know what this age is\ncoming to, that we are plunging down precipices, that now here is\nsomething else gone, that these changes are death to people like\nVholes--a man of undoubted respectability, with a father in the Vale\nof Taunton, and three daughters at home. Take a few steps more in\nthis direction, say they, and what is to become of Vholes's father?\nIs he to perish? And of Vholes's daughters? Are they to be\nshirt-makers, or governesses? As though, Mr. Vholes and his relations\nbeing minor cannibal chiefs and it being proposed to abolish\ncannibalism, indignant champions were to put the case thus: Make\nman-eating unlawful, and you starve the Vholeses!\n\nIn a word, Mr. Vholes, with his three daughters and his father in the\nVale of Taunton, is continually doing duty, like a piece of timber,\nto shore up some decayed foundation that has become a pitfall and a\nnuisance. And with a great many people in a great many instances, the\nquestion is never one of a change from wrong to right (which is quite\nan extraneous consideration), but is always one of injury or\nadvantage to that eminently respectable legion, Vholes.\n\nThe Chancellor is, within these ten minutes, \"up\" for the long\nvacation. Mr. Vholes, and his young client, and several blue bags\nhastily stuffed out of all regularity of form, as the larger sort of\nserpents are in their first gorged state, have returned to the\nofficial den. Mr. Vholes, quiet and unmoved, as a man of so much\nrespectability ought to be, takes off his close black gloves as if he\nwere skinning his hands, lifts off his tight hat as if he were\nscalping himself, and sits down at his desk. The client throws his\nhat and gloves upon the ground--tosses them anywhere, without looking\nafter them or caring where they go; flings himself into a chair, half\nsighing and half groaning; rests his aching head upon his hand and\nlooks the portrait of young despair.\n\n\"Again nothing done!\" says Richard. \"Nothing, nothing done!\"\n\n\"Don't say nothing done, sir,\" returns the placid Vholes. \"That is\nscarcely fair, sir, scarcely fair!\"\n\n\"Why, what IS done?\" says Richard, turning gloomily upon him.\n\n\"That may not be the whole question,\" returns Vholes, \"The question\nmay branch off into what is doing, what is doing?\"\n\n\"And what is doing?\" asks the moody client.\n\nVholes, sitting with his arms on the desk, quietly bringing the tips\nof his five right fingers to meet the tips of his five left fingers,\nand quietly separating them again, and fixedly and slowly looking at\nhis client, replies, \"A good deal is doing, sir. We have put our\nshoulders to the wheel, Mr. Carstone, and the wheel is going round.\"\n\n\"Yes, with Ixion on it. How am I to get through the next four or five\naccursed months?\" exclaims the young man, rising from his chair and\nwalking about the room.\n\n\"Mr. C.,\" returns Vholes, following him close with his eyes wherever\nhe goes, \"your spirits are hasty, and I am sorry for it on your\naccount. Excuse me if I recommend you not to chafe so much, not to be\nso impetuous, not to wear yourself out so. You should have more\npatience. You should sustain yourself better.\"\n\n\"I ought to imitate you, in fact, Mr. Vholes?\" says Richard, sitting\ndown again with an impatient laugh and beating the devil's tattoo\nwith his boot on the patternless carpet.\n\n\"Sir,\" returns Vholes, always looking at the client as if he were\nmaking a lingering meal of him with his eyes as well as with his\nprofessional appetite. \"Sir,\" returns Vholes with his inward manner\nof speech and his bloodless quietude, \"I should not have had the\npresumption to propose myself as a model for your imitation or any\nman's. Let me but leave the good name to my three daughters, and that\nis enough for me; I am not a self-seeker. But since you mention me so\npointedly, I will acknowledge that I should like to impart to you a\nlittle of my--come, sir, you are disposed to call it insensibility,\nand I am sure I have no objection--say insensibility--a little of my\ninsensibility.\"\n\n\"Mr. Vholes,\" explains the client, somewhat abashed, \"I had no\nintention to accuse you of insensibility.\"\n\n\"I think you had, sir, without knowing it,\" returns the equable\nVholes. \"Very naturally. It is my duty to attend to your interests\nwith a cool head, and I can quite understand that to your excited\nfeelings I may appear, at such times as the present, insensible. My\ndaughters may know me better; my aged father may know me better. But\nthey have known me much longer than you have, and the confiding eye\nof affection is not the distrustful eye of business. Not that I\ncomplain, sir, of the eye of business being distrustful; quite the\ncontrary. In attending to your interests, I wish to have all possible\nchecks upon me; it is right that I should have them; I court inquiry.\nBut your interests demand that I should be cool and methodical, Mr.\nCarstone; and I cannot be otherwise--no, sir, not even to please\nyou.\"\n\nMr. Vholes, after glancing at the official cat who is patiently\nwatching a mouse's hole, fixes his charmed gaze again on his young\nclient and proceeds in his buttoned-up, half-audible voice as if\nthere were an unclean spirit in him that will neither come out nor\nspeak out, \"What are you to do, sir, you inquire, during the\nvacation. I should hope you gentlemen of the army may find many means\nof amusing yourselves if you give your minds to it. If you had asked\nme what I was to do during the vacation, I could have answered you\nmore readily. I am to attend to your interests. I am to be found\nhere, day by day, attending to your interests. That is my duty, Mr.\nC., and term-time or vacation makes no difference to me. If you wish\nto consult me as to your interests, you will find me here at all\ntimes alike. Other professional men go out of town. I don't. Not that\nI blame them for going; I merely say I don't go. This desk is your\nrock, sir!\"\n\nMr. Vholes gives it a rap, and it sounds as hollow as a coffin. Not\nto Richard, though. There is encouragement in the sound to him.\nPerhaps Mr. Vholes knows there is.\n\n\"I am perfectly aware, Mr. Vholes,\" says Richard, more familiarly and\ngood-humouredly, \"that you are the most reliable fellow in the world\nand that to have to do with you is to have to do with a man of\nbusiness who is not to be hoodwinked. But put yourself in my case,\ndragging on this dislocated life, sinking deeper and deeper into\ndifficulty every day, continually hoping and continually\ndisappointed, conscious of change upon change for the worse in\nmyself, and of no change for the better in anything else, and you\nwill find it a dark-looking case sometimes, as I do.\"\n\n\"You know,\" says Mr. Vholes, \"that I never give hopes, sir. I told\nyou from the first, Mr. C., that I never give hopes. Particularly in\na case like this, where the greater part of the costs comes out of\nthe estate, I should not be considerate of my good name if I gave\nhopes. It might seem as if costs were my object. Still, when you say\nthere is no change for the better, I must, as a bare matter of fact,\ndeny that.\"\n\n\"Aye?\" returns Richard, brightening. \"But how do you make it out?\"\n\n\"Mr. Carstone, you are represented by--\"\n\n\"You said just now--a rock.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" says Mr. Vholes, gently shaking his head and rapping the\nhollow desk, with a sound as if ashes were falling on ashes, and dust\non dust, \"a rock. That's something. You are separately represented,\nand no longer hidden and lost in the interests of others. THAT'S\nsomething. The suit does not sleep; we wake it up, we air it, we walk\nit about. THAT'S something. It's not all Jarndyce, in fact as well as\nin name. THAT'S something. Nobody has it all his own way now, sir.\nAnd THAT'S something, surely.\"\n\nRichard, his face flushing suddenly, strikes the desk with his\nclenched hand.\n\n\"Mr. Vholes! If any man had told me when I first went to John\nJarndyce's house that he was anything but the disinterested friend he\nseemed--that he was what he has gradually turned out to be--I could\nhave found no words strong enough to repel the slander; I could not\nhave defended him too ardently. So little did I know of the world!\nWhereas now I do declare to you that he becomes to me the embodiment\nof the suit; that in place of its being an abstraction, it is John\nJarndyce; that the more I suffer, the more indignant I am with him;\nthat every new delay and every new disappointment is only a new\ninjury from John Jarndyce's hand.\"\n\n\"No, no,\" says Vholes. \"Don't say so. We ought to have patience, all\nof us. Besides, I never disparage, sir. I never disparage.\"\n\n\"Mr. Vholes,\" returns the angry client. \"You know as well as I that\nhe would have strangled the suit if he could.\"\n\n\"He was not active in it,\" Mr. Vholes admits with an appearance of\nreluctance. \"He certainly was not active in it. But however, but\nhowever, he might have had amiable intentions. Who can read the\nheart, Mr. C.!\"\n\n\"You can,\" returns Richard.\n\n\"I, Mr. C.?\"\n\n\"Well enough to know what his intentions were. Are or are not our\ninterests conflicting? Tell--me--that!\" says Richard, accompanying\nhis last three words with three raps on his rock of trust.\n\n\"Mr. C.,\" returns Vholes, immovable in attitude and never winking his\nhungry eyes, \"I should be wanting in my duty as your professional\nadviser, I should be departing from my fidelity to your interests, if\nI represented those interests as identical with the interests of Mr.\nJarndyce. They are no such thing, sir. I never impute motives; I both\nhave and am a father, and I never impute motives. But I must not\nshrink from a professional duty, even if it sows dissensions in\nfamilies. I understand you to be now consulting me professionally as\nto your interests? You are so? I reply, then, they are not identical\nwith those of Mr. Jarndyce.\"\n\n\"Of course they are not!\" cries Richard. \"You found that out long\nago.\"\n\n\"Mr. C.,\" returns Vholes, \"I wish to say no more of any third party\nthan is necessary. I wish to leave my good name unsullied, together\nwith any little property of which I may become possessed through\nindustry and perseverance, to my daughters Emma, Jane, and Caroline.\nI also desire to live in amity with my professional brethren. When\nMr. Skimpole did me the honour, sir--I will not say the very high\nhonour, for I never stoop to flattery--of bringing us together in\nthis room, I mentioned to you that I could offer no opinion or advice\nas to your interests while those interests were entrusted to another\nmember of the profession. And I spoke in such terms as I was bound to\nspeak of Kenge and Carboy's office, which stands high. You, sir,\nthought fit to withdraw your interests from that keeping nevertheless\nand to offer them to me. You brought them with clean hands, sir, and\nI accepted them with clean hands. Those interests are now paramount\nin this office. My digestive functions, as you may have heard me\nmention, are not in a good state, and rest might improve them; but I\nshall not rest, sir, while I am your representative. Whenever you\nwant me, you will find me here. Summon me anywhere, and I will come.\nDuring the long vacation, sir, I shall devote my leisure to studying\nyour interests more and more closely and to making arrangements for\nmoving heaven and earth (including, of course, the Chancellor) after\nMichaelmas term; and when I ultimately congratulate you, sir,\" says\nMr. Vholes with the severity of a determined man, \"when I ultimately\ncongratulate you, sir, with all my heart, on your accession to\nfortune--which, but that I never give hopes, I might say something\nfurther about--you will owe me nothing beyond whatever little balance\nmay be then outstanding of the costs as between solicitor and client\nnot included in the taxed costs allowed out of the estate. I pretend\nto no claim upon you, Mr. C., but for the zealous and active\ndischarge--not the languid and routine discharge, sir: that much\ncredit I stipulate for--of my professional duty. My duty prosperously\nended, all between us is ended.\"\n\nVholes finally adds, by way of rider to this declaration of his\nprinciples, that as Mr. Carstone is about to rejoin his regiment,\nperhaps Mr. C. will favour him with an order on his agent for twenty\npounds on account.\n\n\"For there have been many little consultations and attendances of\nlate, sir,\" observes Vholes, turning over the leaves of his diary,\n\"and these things mount up, and I don't profess to be a man of\ncapital. When we first entered on our present relations I stated to\nyou openly--it is a principle of mine that there never can be too\nmuch openness between solicitor and client--that I was not a man of\ncapital and that if capital was your object you had better leave your\npapers in Kenge's office. No, Mr. C., you will find none of the\nadvantages or disadvantages of capital here, sir. This,\" Vholes gives\nthe desk one hollow blow again, \"is your rock; it pretends to be\nnothing more.\"\n\nThe client, with his dejection insensibly relieved and his vague\nhopes rekindled, takes pen and ink and writes the draft, not without\nperplexed consideration and calculation of the date it may bear,\nimplying scant effects in the agent's hands. All the while, Vholes,\nbuttoned up in body and mind, looks at him attentively. All the\nwhile, Vholes's official cat watches the mouse's hole.\n\nLastly, the client, shaking hands, beseeches Mr. Vholes, for heaven's\nsake and earth's sake, to do his utmost to \"pull him through\" the\nCourt of Chancery. Mr. Vholes, who never gives hopes, lays his palm\nupon the client's shoulder and answers with a smile, \"Always here,\nsir. Personally, or by letter, you will always find me here, sir,\nwith my shoulder to the wheel.\" Thus they part, and Vholes, left\nalone, employs himself in carrying sundry little matters out of his\ndiary into his draft bill book for the ultimate behoof of his three\ndaughters. So might an industrious fox or bear make up his account of\nchickens or stray travellers with an eye to his cubs, not to\ndisparage by that word the three raw-visaged, lank, and buttoned-up\nmaidens who dwell with the parent Vholes in an earthy cottage\nsituated in a damp garden at Kennington.\n\nRichard, emerging from the heavy shade of Symond's Inn into the\nsunshine of Chancery Lane--for there happens to be sunshine there\nto-day--walks thoughtfully on, and turns into Lincoln's Inn, and\npasses under the shadow of the Lincoln's Inn trees. On many such\nloungers have the speckled shadows of those trees often fallen; on\nthe like bent head, the bitten nail, the lowering eye, the lingering\nstep, the purposeless and dreamy air, the good consuming and\nconsumed, the life turned sour. This lounger is not shabby yet, but\nthat may come. Chancery, which knows no wisdom but in precedent, is\nvery rich in such precedents; and why should one be different from\nten thousand?\n\nYet the time is so short since his depreciation began that as he\nsaunters away, reluctant to leave the spot for some long months\ntogether, though he hates it, Richard himself may feel his own case\nas if it were a startling one. While his heart is heavy with\ncorroding care, suspense, distrust, and doubt, it may have room for\nsome sorrowful wonder when he recalls how different his first visit\nthere, how different he, how different all the colours of his mind.\nBut injustice breeds injustice; the fighting with shadows and being\ndefeated by them necessitates the setting up of substances to combat;\nfrom the impalpable suit which no man alive can understand, the time\nfor that being long gone by, it has become a gloomy relief to turn to\nthe palpable figure of the friend who would have saved him from this\nruin and make HIM his enemy. Richard has told Vholes the truth. Is he\nin a hardened or a softened mood, he still lays his injuries equally\nat that door; he was thwarted, in that quarter, of a set purpose, and\nthat purpose could only originate in the one subject that is\nresolving his existence into itself; besides, it is a justification\nto him in his own eyes to have an embodied antagonist and oppressor.\n\nIs Richard a monster in all this, or would Chancery be found rich in\nsuch precedents too if they could be got for citation from the\nRecording Angel?\n\nTwo pairs of eyes not unused to such people look after him, as,\nbiting his nails and brooding, he crosses the square and is swallowed\nup by the shadow of the southern gateway. Mr. Guppy and Mr. Weevle\nare the possessors of those eyes, and they have been leaning in\nconversation against the low stone parapet under the trees. He passes\nclose by them, seeing nothing but the ground.\n\n\"William,\" says Mr. Weevle, adjusting his whiskers, \"there's\ncombustion going on there! It's not a case of spontaneous, but it's\nsmouldering combustion it is.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" says Mr. Guppy. \"He wouldn't keep out of Jarndyce, and I\nsuppose he's over head and ears in debt. I never knew much of him. He\nwas as high as the monument when he was on trial at our place. A good\nriddance to me, whether as clerk or client! Well, Tony, that as I was\nmentioning is what they're up to.\"\n\nMr. Guppy, refolding his arms, resettles himself against the parapet,\nas resuming a conversation of interest.\n\n\"They are still up to it, sir,\" says Mr. Guppy, \"still taking stock,\nstill examining papers, still going over the heaps and heaps of\nrubbish. At this rate they'll be at it these seven years.\"\n\n\"And Small is helping?\"\n\n\"Small left us at a week's notice. Told Kenge his grandfather's\nbusiness was too much for the old gentleman and he could better\nhimself by undertaking it. There had been a coolness between myself\nand Small on account of his being so close. But he said you and I\nbegan it, and as he had me there--for we did--I put our acquaintance\non the old footing. That's how I come to know what they're up to.\"\n\n\"You haven't looked in at all?\"\n\n\"Tony,\" says Mr. Guppy, a little disconcerted, \"to be unreserved with\nyou, I don't greatly relish the house, except in your company, and\ntherefore I have not; and therefore I proposed this little\nappointment for our fetching away your things. There goes the hour by\nthe clock! Tony\"--Mr. Guppy becomes mysteriously and tenderly\neloquent--\"it is necessary that I should impress upon your mind once\nmore that circumstances over which I have no control have made a\nmelancholy alteration in my most cherished plans and in that\nunrequited image which I formerly mentioned to you as a friend. That\nimage is shattered, and that idol is laid low. My only wish now in\nconnexion with the objects which I had an idea of carrying out in the\ncourt with your aid as a friend is to let 'em alone and bury 'em in\noblivion. Do you think it possible, do you think it at all likely (I\nput it to you, Tony, as a friend), from your knowledge of that\ncapricious and deep old character who fell a prey to the--spontaneous\nelement, do you, Tony, think it at all likely that on second thoughts\nhe put those letters away anywhere, after you saw him alive, and that\nthey were not destroyed that night?\"\n\nMr. Weevle reflects for some time. Shakes his head. Decidedly thinks\nnot.\n\n\"Tony,\" says Mr. Guppy as they walk towards the court, \"once again\nunderstand me, as a friend. Without entering into further\nexplanations, I may repeat that the idol is down. I have no purpose\nto serve now but burial in oblivion. To that I have pledged myself. I\nowe it to myself, and I owe it to the shattered image, as also to the\ncircumstances over which I have no control. If you was to express to\nme by a gesture, by a wink, that you saw lying anywhere in your late\nlodgings any papers that so much as looked like the papers in\nquestion, I would pitch them into the fire, sir, on my own\nresponsibility.\"\n\nMr. Weevle nods. Mr. Guppy, much elevated in his own opinion by\nhaving delivered these observations, with an air in part forensic and\nin part romantic--this gentleman having a passion for conducting\nanything in the form of an examination, or delivering anything in the\nform of a summing up or a speech--accompanies his friend with dignity\nto the court.\n\nNever since it has been a court has it had such a Fortunatus' purse\nof gossip as in the proceedings at the rag and bottle shop.\nRegularly, every morning at eight, is the elder Mr. Smallweed brought\ndown to the corner and carried in, accompanied by Mrs. Smallweed,\nJudy, and Bart; and regularly, all day, do they all remain there\nuntil nine at night, solaced by gipsy dinners, not abundant in\nquantity, from the cook's shop, rummaging and searching, digging,\ndelving, and diving among the treasures of the late lamented. What\nthose treasures are they keep so secret that the court is maddened.\nIn its delirium it imagines guineas pouring out of tea-pots,\ncrown-pieces overflowing punch-bowls, old chairs and mattresses\nstuffed with Bank of England notes. It possesses itself of the\nsixpenny history (with highly coloured folding frontispiece) of Mr.\nDaniel Dancer and his sister, and also of Mr. Elwes, of Suffolk, and\ntransfers all the facts from those authentic narratives to Mr. Krook.\nTwice when the dustman is called in to carry off a cartload of old\npaper, ashes, and broken bottles, the whole court assembles and pries\ninto the baskets as they come forth. Many times the two gentlemen who\nwrite with the ravenous little pens on the tissue-paper are seen\nprowling in the neighbourhood--shy of each other, their late\npartnership being dissolved. The Sol skilfully carries a vein of the\nprevailing interest through the Harmonic nights. Little Swills, in\nwhat are professionally known as \"patter\" allusions to the subject,\nis received with loud applause; and the same vocalist \"gags\" in the\nregular business like a man inspired. Even Miss M. Melvilleson, in\nthe revived Caledonian melody of \"We're a-Nodding,\" points the\nsentiment that \"the dogs love broo\" (whatever the nature of that\nrefreshment may be) with such archness and such a turn of the head\ntowards next door that she is immediately understood to mean Mr.\nSmallweed loves to find money, and is nightly honoured with a double\nencore. For all this, the court discovers nothing; and as Mrs. Piper\nand Mrs. Perkins now communicate to the late lodger whose appearance\nis the signal for a general rally, it is in one continual ferment to\ndiscover everything, and more.\n\nMr. Weevle and Mr. Guppy, with every eye in the court's head upon\nthem, knock at the closed door of the late lamented's house, in a\nhigh state of popularity. But being contrary to the court's\nexpectation admitted, they immediately become unpopular and are\nconsidered to mean no good.\n\nThe shutters are more or less closed all over the house, and the\nground-floor is sufficiently dark to require candles. Introduced into\nthe back shop by Mr. Smallweed the younger, they, fresh from the\nsunlight, can at first see nothing save darkness and shadows; but\nthey gradually discern the elder Mr. Smallweed seated in his chair\nupon the brink of a well or grave of waste-paper, the virtuous Judy\ngroping therein like a female sexton, and Mrs. Smallweed on the level\nground in the vicinity snowed up in a heap of paper fragments, print,\nand manuscript which would appear to be the accumulated compliments\nthat have been sent flying at her in the course of the day. The whole\nparty, Small included, are blackened with dust and dirt and present a\nfiendish appearance not relieved by the general aspect of the room.\nThere is more litter and lumber in it than of old, and it is dirtier\nif possible; likewise, it is ghostly with traces of its dead\ninhabitant and even with his chalked writing on the wall.\n\nOn the entrance of visitors, Mr. Smallweed and Judy simultaneously\nfold their arms and stop in their researches.\n\n\"Aha!\" croaks the old gentleman. \"How de do, gentlemen, how de do!\nCome to fetch your property, Mr. Weevle? That's well, that's well.\nHa! Ha! We should have been forced to sell you up, sir, to pay your\nwarehouse room if you had left it here much longer. You feel quite at\nhome here again, I dare say? Glad to see you, glad to see you!\"\n\nMr. Weevle, thanking him, casts an eye about. Mr. Guppy's eye follows\nMr. Weevle's eye. Mr. Weevle's eye comes back without any new\nintelligence in it. Mr. Guppy's eye comes back and meets Mr.\nSmallweed's eye. That engaging old gentleman is still murmuring, like\nsome wound-up instrument running down, \"How de do, sir--how\nde--how--\" And then having run down, he lapses into grinning silence,\nas Mr. Guppy starts at seeing Mr. Tulkinghorn standing in the\ndarkness opposite with his hands behind him.\n\n\"Gentleman so kind as to act as my solicitor,\" says Grandfather\nSmallweed. \"I am not the sort of client for a gentleman of such note,\nbut he is so good!\"\n\nMr. Guppy, slightly nudging his friend to take another look, makes a\nshuffling bow to Mr. Tulkinghorn, who returns it with an easy nod.\nMr. Tulkinghorn is looking on as if he had nothing else to do and\nwere rather amused by the novelty.\n\n\"A good deal of property here, sir, I should say,\" Mr. Guppy observes\nto Mr. Smallweed.\n\n\"Principally rags and rubbish, my dear friend! Rags and rubbish! Me\nand Bart and my granddaughter Judy are endeavouring to make out an\ninventory of what's worth anything to sell. But we haven't come to\nmuch as yet; we--haven't--come--to--hah!\"\n\nMr. Smallweed has run down again, while Mr. Weevle's eye, attended by\nMr. Guppy's eye, has again gone round the room and come back.\n\n\"Well, sir,\" says Mr. Weevle. \"We won't intrude any longer if you'll\nallow us to go upstairs.\"\n\n\"Anywhere, my dear sir, anywhere! You're at home. Make yourself so,\npray!\"\n\nAs they go upstairs, Mr. Guppy lifts his eyebrows inquiringly and\nlooks at Tony. Tony shakes his head. They find the old room very dull\nand dismal, with the ashes of the fire that was burning on that\nmemorable night yet in the discoloured grate. They have a great\ndisinclination to touch any object, and carefully blow the dust from\nit first. Nor are they desirous to prolong their visit, packing the\nfew movables with all possible speed and never speaking above a\nwhisper.\n\n\"Look here,\" says Tony, recoiling. \"Here's that horrible cat coming\nin!\"\n\nMr. Guppy retreats behind a chair. \"Small told me of her. She went\nleaping and bounding and tearing about that night like a dragon, and\ngot out on the house-top, and roamed about up there for a fortnight,\nand then came tumbling down the chimney very thin. Did you ever see\nsuch a brute? Looks as if she knew all about it, don't she? Almost\nlooks as if she was Krook. Shoohoo! Get out, you goblin!\"\n\nLady Jane, in the doorway, with her tiger snarl from ear to ear and\nher club of a tail, shows no intention of obeying; but Mr.\nTulkinghorn stumbling over her, she spits at his rusty legs, and\nswearing wrathfully, takes her arched back upstairs. Possibly to roam\nthe house-tops again and return by the chimney.\n\n\"Mr. Guppy,\" says Mr. Tulkinghorn, \"could I have a word with you?\"\n\nMr. Guppy is engaged in collecting the Galaxy Gallery of British\nBeauty from the wall and depositing those works of art in their old\nignoble band-box. \"Sir,\" he returns, reddening, \"I wish to act with\ncourtesy towards every member of the profession, and especially, I am\nsure, towards a member of it so well known as yourself--I will truly\nadd, sir, so distinguished as yourself. Still, Mr. Tulkinghorn, sir,\nI must stipulate that if you have any word with me, that word is\nspoken in the presence of my friend.\"\n\n\"Oh, indeed?\" says Mr. Tulkinghorn.\n\n\"Yes, sir. My reasons are not of a personal nature at all, but they\nare amply sufficient for myself.\"\n\n\"No doubt, no doubt.\" Mr. Tulkinghorn is as imperturbable as the\nhearthstone to which he has quietly walked. \"The matter is not of\nthat consequence that I need put you to the trouble of making any\nconditions, Mr. Guppy.\" He pauses here to smile, and his smile is as\ndull and rusty as his pantaloons. \"You are to be congratulated, Mr.\nGuppy; you are a fortunate young man, sir.\"\n\n\"Pretty well so, Mr. Tulkinghorn; I don't complain.\"\n\n\"Complain? High friends, free admission to great houses, and access\nto elegant ladies! Why, Mr. Guppy, there are people in London who\nwould give their ears to be you.\"\n\nMr. Guppy, looking as if he would give his own reddening and still\nreddening ears to be one of those people at present instead of\nhimself, replies, \"Sir, if I attend to my profession and do what is\nright by Kenge and Carboy, my friends and acquaintances are of no\nconsequence to them nor to any member of the profession, not\nexcepting Mr. Tulkinghorn of the Fields. I am not under any\nobligation to explain myself further; and with all respect for you,\nsir, and without offence--I repeat, without offence--\"\n\n\"Oh, certainly!\"\n\n\"--I don't intend to do it.\"\n\n\"Quite so,\" says Mr. Tulkinghorn with a calm nod. \"Very good; I see\nby these portraits that you take a strong interest in the fashionable\ngreat, sir?\"\n\nHe addresses this to the astounded Tony, who admits the soft\nimpeachment.\n\n\"A virtue in which few Englishmen are deficient,\" observes Mr.\nTulkinghorn. He has been standing on the hearthstone with his back to\nthe smoked chimney-piece, and now turns round with his glasses to his\neyes. \"Who is this? 'Lady Dedlock.' Ha! A very good likeness in its\nway, but it wants force of character. Good day to you, gentlemen;\ngood day!\"\n\nWhen he has walked out, Mr. Guppy, in a great perspiration, nerves\nhimself to the hasty completion of the taking down of the Galaxy\nGallery, concluding with Lady Dedlock.\n\n\"Tony,\" he says hurriedly to his astonished companion, \"let us be\nquick in putting the things together and in getting out of this\nplace. It were in vain longer to conceal from you, Tony, that between\nmyself and one of the members of a swan-like aristocracy whom I now\nhold in my hand, there has been undivulged communication and\nassociation. The time might have been when I might have revealed it\nto you. It never will be more. It is due alike to the oath I have\ntaken, alike to the shattered idol, and alike to circumstances over\nwhich I have no control, that the whole should be buried in oblivion.\nI charge you as a friend, by the interest you have ever testified in\nthe fashionable intelligence, and by any little advances with which I\nmay have been able to accommodate you, so to bury it without a word\nof inquiry!\"\n\nThis charge Mr. Guppy delivers in a state little short of forensic\nlunacy, while his friend shows a dazed mind in his whole head of hair\nand even in his cultivated whiskers.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XL\n\nNational and Domestic\n\n\nEngland has been in a dreadful state for some weeks. Lord Coodle\nwould go out, Sir Thomas Doodle wouldn't come in, and there being\nnobody in Great Britain (to speak of) except Coodle and Doodle, there\nhas been no government. It is a mercy that the hostile meeting\nbetween those two great men, which at one time seemed inevitable, did\nnot come off, because if both pistols had taken effect, and Coodle\nand Doodle had killed each other, it is to be presumed that England\nmust have waited to be governed until young Coodle and young Doodle,\nnow in frocks and long stockings, were grown up. This stupendous\nnational calamity, however, was averted by Lord Coodle's making the\ntimely discovery that if in the heat of debate he had said that he\nscorned and despised the whole ignoble career of Sir Thomas Doodle,\nhe had merely meant to say that party differences should never induce\nhim to withhold from it the tribute of his warmest admiration; while\nit as opportunely turned out, on the other hand, that Sir Thomas\nDoodle had in his own bosom expressly booked Lord Coodle to go down\nto posterity as the mirror of virtue and honour. Still England has\nbeen some weeks in the dismal strait of having no pilot (as was well\nobserved by Sir Leicester Dedlock) to weather the storm; and the\nmarvellous part of the matter is that England has not appeared to\ncare very much about it, but has gone on eating and drinking and\nmarrying and giving in marriage as the old world did in the days\nbefore the flood. But Coodle knew the danger, and Doodle knew the\ndanger, and all their followers and hangers-on had the clearest\npossible perception of the danger. At last Sir Thomas Doodle has not\nonly condescended to come in, but has done it handsomely, bringing in\nwith him all his nephews, all his male cousins, and all his\nbrothers-in-law. So there is hope for the old ship yet.\n\nDoodle has found that he must throw himself upon the country, chiefly\nin the form of sovereigns and beer. In this metamorphosed state he is\navailable in a good many places simultaneously and can throw himself\nupon a considerable portion of the country at one time. Britannia\nbeing much occupied in pocketing Doodle in the form of sovereigns,\nand swallowing Doodle in the form of beer, and in swearing herself\nblack in the face that she does neither--plainly to the advancement\nof her glory and morality--the London season comes to a sudden end,\nthrough all the Doodleites and Coodleites dispersing to assist\nBritannia in those religious exercises.\n\nHence Mrs. Rouncewell, housekeeper at Chesney Wold, foresees, though\nno instructions have yet come down, that the family may shortly be\nexpected, together with a pretty large accession of cousins and\nothers who can in any way assist the great Constitutional work. And\nhence the stately old dame, taking Time by the forelock, leads him up\nand down the staircases, and along the galleries and passages, and\nthrough the rooms, to witness before he grows any older that\neverything is ready, that floors are rubbed bright, carpets spread,\ncurtains shaken out, beds puffed and patted, still-room and kitchen\ncleared for action--all things prepared as beseems the Dedlock\ndignity.\n\nThis present summer evening, as the sun goes down, the preparations\nare complete. Dreary and solemn the old house looks, with so many\nappliances of habitation and with no inhabitants except the pictured\nforms upon the walls. So did these come and go, a Dedlock in\npossession might have ruminated passing along; so did they see this\ngallery hushed and quiet, as I see it now; so think, as I think, of\nthe gap that they would make in this domain when they were gone; so\nfind it, as I find it, difficult to believe that it could be without\nthem; so pass from my world, as I pass from theirs, now closing the\nreverberating door; so leave no blank to miss them, and so die.\n\nThrough some of the fiery windows beautiful from without, and set, at\nthis sunset hour, not in dull-grey stone but in a glorious house of\ngold, the light excluded at other windows pours in rich, lavish,\noverflowing like the summer plenty in the land. Then do the frozen\nDedlocks thaw. Strange movements come upon their features as the\nshadows of leaves play there. A dense justice in a corner is beguiled\ninto a wink. A staring baronet, with a truncheon, gets a dimple in\nhis chin. Down into the bosom of a stony shepherdess there steals a\nfleck of light and warmth that would have done it good a hundred\nyears ago. One ancestress of Volumnia, in high-heeled shoes, very\nlike her--casting the shadow of that virgin event before her full two\ncenturies--shoots out into a halo and becomes a saint. A maid of\nhonour of the court of Charles the Second, with large round eyes (and\nother charms to correspond), seems to bathe in glowing water, and it\nripples as it glows.\n\nBut the fire of the sun is dying. Even now the floor is dusky, and\nshadow slowly mounts the walls, bringing the Dedlocks down like age\nand death. And now, upon my Lady's picture over the great\nchimney-piece, a weird shade falls from some old tree, that turns it\npale, and flutters it, and looks as if a great arm held a veil or\nhood, watching an opportunity to draw it over her. Higher and darker\nrises shadow on the wall--now a red gloom on the ceiling--now the\nfire is out.\n\nAll that prospect, which from the terrace looked so near, has moved\nsolemnly away and changed--not the first nor the last of beautiful\nthings that look so near and will so change--into a distant phantom.\nLight mists arise, and the dew falls, and all the sweet scents in the\ngarden are heavy in the air. Now the woods settle into great masses\nas if they were each one profound tree. And now the moon rises to\nseparate them, and to glimmer here and there in horizontal lines\nbehind their stems, and to make the avenue a pavement of light among\nhigh cathedral arches fantastically broken.\n\nNow the moon is high; and the great house, needing habitation more\nthan ever, is like a body without life. Now it is even awful,\nstealing through it, to think of the live people who have slept in\nthe solitary bedrooms, to say nothing of the dead. Now is the time\nfor shadow, when every corner is a cavern and every downward step a\npit, when the stained glass is reflected in pale and faded hues upon\nthe floors, when anything and everything can be made of the heavy\nstaircase beams excepting their own proper shapes, when the armour\nhas dull lights upon it not easily to be distinguished from stealthy\nmovement, and when barred helmets are frightfully suggestive of heads\ninside. But of all the shadows in Chesney Wold, the shadow in the\nlong drawing-room upon my Lady's picture is the first to come, the\nlast to be disturbed. At this hour and by this light it changes into\nthreatening hands raised up and menacing the handsome face with every\nbreath that stirs.\n\n\"She is not well, ma'am,\" says a groom in Mrs. Rouncewell's\naudience-chamber.\n\n\"My Lady not well! What's the matter?\"\n\n\"Why, my Lady has been but poorly, ma'am, since she was last here--I\ndon't mean with the family, ma'am, but when she was here as a bird of\npassage like. My Lady has not been out much, for her, and has kept\nher room a good deal.\"\n\n\"Chesney Wold, Thomas,\" rejoins the housekeeper with proud\ncomplacency, \"will set my Lady up! There is no finer air and no\nhealthier soil in the world!\"\n\nThomas may have his own personal opinions on this subject, probably\nhints them in his manner of smoothing his sleek head from the nape of\nhis neck to his temples, but he forbears to express them further and\nretires to the servants' hall to regale on cold meat-pie and ale.\n\nThis groom is the pilot-fish before the nobler shark. Next evening,\ndown come Sir Leicester and my Lady with their largest retinue, and\ndown come the cousins and others from all the points of the compass.\nThenceforth for some weeks backward and forward rush mysterious men\nwith no names, who fly about all those particular parts of the\ncountry on which Doodle is at present throwing himself in an\nauriferous and malty shower, but who are merely persons of a restless\ndisposition and never do anything anywhere.\n\nOn these national occasions Sir Leicester finds the cousins useful. A\nbetter man than the Honourable Bob Stables to meet the Hunt at\ndinner, there could not possibly be. Better got up gentlemen than the\nother cousins to ride over to polling-booths and hustings here and\nthere, and show themselves on the side of England, it would be hard\nto find. Volumnia is a little dim, but she is of the true descent;\nand there are many who appreciate her sprightly conversation, her\nFrench conundrums so old as to have become in the cycles of time\nalmost new again, the honour of taking the fair Dedlock in to dinner,\nor even the privilege of her hand in the dance. On these national\noccasions dancing may be a patriotic service, and Volumnia is\nconstantly seen hopping about for the good of an ungrateful and\nunpensioning country.\n\nMy Lady takes no great pains to entertain the numerous guests, and\nbeing still unwell, rarely appears until late in the day. But at all\nthe dismal dinners, leaden lunches, basilisk balls, and other\nmelancholy pageants, her mere appearance is a relief. As to Sir\nLeicester, he conceives it utterly impossible that anything can be\nwanting, in any direction, by any one who has the good fortune to be\nreceived under that roof; and in a state of sublime satisfaction, he\nmoves among the company, a magnificent refrigerator.\n\nDaily the cousins trot through dust and canter over roadside turf,\naway to hustings and polling-booths (with leather gloves and\nhunting-whips for the counties and kid gloves and riding-canes for\nthe boroughs), and daily bring back reports on which Sir Leicester\nholds forth after dinner. Daily the restless men who have no\noccupation in life present the appearance of being rather busy. Daily\nVolumnia has a little cousinly talk with Sir Leicester on the state\nof the nation, from which Sir Leicester is disposed to conclude that\nVolumnia is a more reflecting woman than he had thought her.\n\n\"How are we getting on?\" says Miss Volumnia, clasping her hands. \"ARE\nwe safe?\"\n\nThe mighty business is nearly over by this time, and Doodle will\nthrow himself off the country in a few days more. Sir Leicester has\njust appeared in the long drawing-room after dinner, a bright\nparticular star surrounded by clouds of cousins.\n\n\"Volumnia,\" replies Sir Leicester, who has a list in his hand, \"we\nare doing tolerably.\"\n\n\"Only tolerably!\"\n\nAlthough it is summer weather, Sir Leicester always has his own\nparticular fire in the evening. He takes his usual screened seat near\nit and repeats with much firmness and a little displeasure, as who\nshould say, I am not a common man, and when I say tolerably, it must\nnot be understood as a common expression, \"Volumnia, we are doing\ntolerably.\"\n\n\"At least there is no opposition to YOU,\" Volumnia asserts with\nconfidence.\n\n\"No, Volumnia. This distracted country has lost its senses in many\nrespects, I grieve to say, but--\"\n\n\"It is not so mad as that. I am glad to hear it!\"\n\nVolumnia's finishing the sentence restores her to favour. Sir\nLeicester, with a gracious inclination of his head, seems to say to\nhimself, \"A sensible woman this, on the whole, though occasionally\nprecipitate.\"\n\nIn fact, as to this question of opposition, the fair Dedlock's\nobservation was superfluous, Sir Leicester on these occasions always\ndelivering in his own candidateship, as a kind of handsome wholesale\norder to be promptly executed. Two other little seats that belong to\nhim he treats as retail orders of less importance, merely sending\ndown the men and signifying to the tradespeople, \"You will have the\ngoodness to make these materials into two members of Parliament and\nto send them home when done.\"\n\n\"I regret to say, Volumnia, that in many places the people have shown\na bad spirit, and that this opposition to the government has been of\na most determined and most implacable description.\"\n\n\"W-r-retches!\" says Volumnia.\n\n\"Even,\" proceeds Sir Leicester, glancing at the circumjacent cousins\non sofas and ottomans, \"even in many--in fact, in most--of those\nplaces in which the government has carried it against a faction--\"\n\n(Note, by the way, that the Coodleites are always a faction with the\nDoodleites, and that the Doodleites occupy exactly the same position\ntowards the Coodleites.)\n\n\"--Even in them I am shocked, for the credit of Englishmen, to be\nconstrained to inform you that the party has not triumphed without\nbeing put to an enormous expense. Hundreds,\" says Sir Leicester,\neyeing the cousins with increasing dignity and swelling indignation,\n\"hundreds of thousands of pounds!\"\n\nIf Volumnia have a fault, it is the fault of being a trifle too\ninnocent, seeing that the innocence which would go extremely well\nwith a sash and tucker is a little out of keeping with the rouge and\npearl necklace. Howbeit, impelled by innocence, she asks, \"What for?\"\n\n\"Volumnia,\" remonstrates Sir Leicester with his utmost severity.\n\"Volumnia!\"\n\n\"No, no, I don't mean what for,\" cries Volumnia with her favourite\nlittle scream. \"How stupid I am! I mean what a pity!\"\n\n\"I am glad,\" returns Sir Leicester, \"that you do mean what a pity.\"\n\nVolumnia hastens to express her opinion that the shocking people\nought to be tried as traitors and made to support the party.\n\n\"I am glad, Volumnia,\" repeats Sir Leicester, unmindful of these\nmollifying sentiments, \"that you do mean what a pity. It is\ndisgraceful to the electors. But as you, though inadvertently and\nwithout intending so unreasonable a question, asked me 'what for?'\nlet me reply to you. For necessary expenses. And I trust to your good\nsense, Volumnia, not to pursue the subject, here or elsewhere.\"\n\nSir Leicester feels it incumbent on him to observe a crushing aspect\ntowards Volumnia because it is whispered abroad that these necessary\nexpenses will, in some two hundred election petitions, be\nunpleasantly connected with the word bribery, and because some\ngraceless jokers have consequently suggested the omission from the\nChurch service of the ordinary supplication in behalf of the High\nCourt of Parliament and have recommended instead that the prayers of\nthe congregation be requested for six hundred and fifty-eight\ngentlemen in a very unhealthy state.\n\n\"I suppose,\" observes Volumnia, having taken a little time to recover\nher spirits after her late castigation, \"I suppose Mr. Tulkinghorn\nhas been worked to death.\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" says Sir Leicester, opening his eyes, \"why Mr.\nTulkinghorn should be worked to death. I don't know what Mr.\nTulkinghorn's engagements may be. He is not a candidate.\"\n\nVolumnia had thought he might have been employed. Sir Leicester could\ndesire to know by whom, and what for. Volumnia, abashed again,\nsuggests, by somebody--to advise and make arrangements. Sir Leicester\nis not aware that any client of Mr. Tulkinghorn has been in need of\nhis assistance.\n\nLady Dedlock, seated at an open window with her arm upon its\ncushioned ledge and looking out at the evening shadows falling on the\npark, has seemed to attend since the lawyer's name was mentioned.\n\nA languid cousin with a moustache in a state of extreme debility now\nobserves from his couch that man told him ya'as'dy that Tulkinghorn\nhad gone down t' that iron place t' give legal 'pinion 'bout\nsomething, and that contest being over t' day, 'twould be highly\njawlly thing if Tulkinghorn should 'pear with news that Coodle man\nwas floored.\n\nMercury in attendance with coffee informs Sir Leicester, hereupon,\nthat Mr. Tulkinghorn has arrived and is taking dinner. My Lady turns\nher head inward for the moment, then looks out again as before.\n\nVolumnia is charmed to hear that her delight is come. He is so\noriginal, such a stolid creature, such an immense being for knowing\nall sorts of things and never telling them! Volumnia is persuaded\nthat he must be a Freemason. Is sure he is at the head of a lodge,\nand wears short aprons, and is made a perfect idol of with\ncandlesticks and trowels. These lively remarks the fair Dedlock\ndelivers in her youthful manner, while making a purse.\n\n\"He has not been here once,\" she adds, \"since I came. I really had\nsome thoughts of breaking my heart for the inconstant creature. I had\nalmost made up my mind that he was dead.\"\n\nIt may be the gathering gloom of evening, or it may be the darker\ngloom within herself, but a shade is on my Lady's face, as if she\nthought, \"I would he were!\"\n\n\"Mr. Tulkinghorn,\" says Sir Leicester, \"is always welcome here and\nalways discreet wheresoever he is. A very valuable person, and\ndeservedly respected.\"\n\nThe debilitated cousin supposes he is \"'normously rich fler.\"\n\n\"He has a stake in the country,\" says Sir Leicester, \"I have no\ndoubt. He is, of course, handsomely paid, and he associates almost on\na footing of equality with the highest society.\"\n\nEverybody starts. For a gun is fired close by.\n\n\"Good gracious, what's that?\" cries Volumnia with her little withered\nscream.\n\n\"A rat,\" says my Lady. \"And they have shot him.\"\n\nEnter Mr. Tulkinghorn, followed by Mercuries with lamps and candles.\n\n\"No, no,\" says Sir Leicester, \"I think not. My Lady, do you object to\nthe twilight?\"\n\nOn the contrary, my Lady prefers it.\n\n\"Volumnia?\"\n\nOh! Nothing is so delicious to Volumnia as to sit and talk in the\ndark.\n\n\"Then take them away,\" says Sir Leicester. \"Tulkinghorn, I beg your\npardon. How do you do?\"\n\nMr. Tulkinghorn with his usual leisurely ease advances, renders his\npassing homage to my Lady, shakes Sir Leicester's hand, and subsides\ninto the chair proper to him when he has anything to communicate, on\nthe opposite side of the Baronet's little newspaper-table. Sir\nLeicester is apprehensive that my Lady, not being very well, will\ntake cold at that open window. My Lady is obliged to him, but would\nrather sit there for the air. Sir Leicester rises, adjusts her scarf\nabout her, and returns to his seat. Mr. Tulkinghorn in the meanwhile\ntakes a pinch of snuff.\n\n\"Now,\" says Sir Leicester. \"How has that contest gone?\"\n\n\"Oh, hollow from the beginning. Not a chance. They have brought in\nboth their people. You are beaten out of all reason. Three to one.\"\n\nIt is a part of Mr. Tulkinghorn's policy and mastery to have no\npolitical opinions; indeed, NO opinions. Therefore he says \"you\" are\nbeaten, and not \"we.\"\n\nSir Leicester is majestically wroth. Volumnia never heard of such a\nthing. 'The debilitated cousin holds that it's sort of thing that's\nsure tapn slongs votes--giv'n--Mob.\n\n\"It's the place, you know,\" Mr. Tulkinghorn goes on to say in the\nfast-increasing darkness when there is silence again, \"where they\nwanted to put up Mrs. Rouncewell's son.\"\n\n\"A proposal which, as you correctly informed me at the time, he had\nthe becoming taste and perception,\" observes Sir Leicester, \"to\ndecline. I cannot say that I by any means approve of the sentiments\nexpressed by Mr. Rouncewell when he was here for some half-hour in\nthis room, but there was a sense of propriety in his decision which I\nam glad to acknowledge.\"\n\n\"Ha!\" says Mr. Tulkinghorn. \"It did not prevent him from being very\nactive in this election, though.\"\n\nSir Leicester is distinctly heard to gasp before speaking. \"Did I\nunderstand you? Did you say that Mr. Rouncewell had been very active\nin this election?\"\n\n\"Uncommonly active.\"\n\n\"Against--\"\n\n\"Oh, dear yes, against you. He is a very good speaker. Plain and\nemphatic. He made a damaging effect, and has great influence. In the\nbusiness part of the proceedings he carried all before him.\"\n\nIt is evident to the whole company, though nobody can see him, that\nSir Leicester is staring majestically.\n\n\"And he was much assisted,\" says Mr. Tulkinghorn as a wind-up, \"by\nhis son.\"\n\n\"By his son, sir?\" repeats Sir Leicester with awful politeness.\n\n\"By his son.\"\n\n\"The son who wished to marry the young woman in my Lady's service?\"\n\n\"That son. He has but one.\"\n\n\"Then upon my honour,\" says Sir Leicester after a terrific pause\nduring which he has been heard to snort and felt to stare, \"then\nupon my honour, upon my life, upon my reputation and principles,\nthe floodgates of society are burst open, and the waters\nhave--a--obliterated the landmarks of the framework of the cohesion\nby which things are held together!\"\n\nGeneral burst of cousinly indignation. Volumnia thinks it is\nreally high time, you know, for somebody in power to step in\nand do something strong. Debilitated cousin thinks--country's\ngoing--Dayvle--steeple-chase pace.\n\n\"I beg,\" says Sir Leicester in a breathless condition, \"that we may\nnot comment further on this circumstance. Comment is superfluous. My\nLady, let me suggest in reference to that young woman--\"\n\n\"I have no intention,\" observes my Lady from her window in a low but\ndecided tone, \"of parting with her.\"\n\n\"That was not my meaning,\" returns Sir Leicester. \"I am glad to hear\nyou say so. I would suggest that as you think her worthy of your\npatronage, you should exert your influence to keep her from these\ndangerous hands. You might show her what violence would be done in\nsuch association to her duties and principles, and you might preserve\nher for a better fate. You might point out to her that she probably\nwould, in good time, find a husband at Chesney Wold by whom she would\nnot be--\" Sir Leicester adds, after a moment's consideration,\n\"dragged from the altars of her forefathers.\"\n\nThese remarks he offers with his unvarying politeness and deference\nwhen he addresses himself to his wife. She merely moves her head in\nreply. The moon is rising, and where she sits there is a little\nstream of cold pale light, in which her head is seen.\n\n\"It is worthy of remark,\" says Mr. Tulkinghorn, \"however, that these\npeople are, in their way, very proud.\"\n\n\"Proud?\" Sir Leicester doubts his hearing.\n\n\"I should not be surprised if they all voluntarily abandoned the\ngirl--yes, lover and all--instead of her abandoning them, supposing\nshe remained at Chesney Wold under such circumstances.\"\n\n\"Well!\" says Sir Leicester tremulously. \"Well! You should know, Mr.\nTulkinghorn. You have been among them.\"\n\n\"Really, Sir Leicester,\" returns the lawyer, \"I state the fact. Why,\nI could tell you a story--with Lady Dedlock's permission.\"\n\nHer head concedes it, and Volumnia is enchanted. A story! Oh, he is\ngoing to tell something at last! A ghost in it, Volumnia hopes?\n\n\"No. Real flesh and blood.\" Mr. Tulkinghorn stops for an instant and\nrepeats with some little emphasis grafted upon his usual monotony,\n\"Real flesh and blood, Miss Dedlock. Sir Leicester, these particulars\nhave only lately become known to me. They are very brief. They\nexemplify what I have said. I suppress names for the present. Lady\nDedlock will not think me ill-bred, I hope?\"\n\nBy the light of the fire, which is low, he can be seen looking\ntowards the moonlight. By the light of the moon Lady Dedlock can be\nseen, perfectly still.\n\n\"A townsman of this Mrs. Rouncewell, a man in exactly parallel\ncircumstances as I am told, had the good fortune to have a daughter\nwho attracted the notice of a great lady. I speak of really a great\nlady, not merely great to him, but married to a gentleman of your\ncondition, Sir Leicester.\"\n\nSir Leicester condescendingly says, \"Yes, Mr. Tulkinghorn,\" implying\nthat then she must have appeared of very considerable moral\ndimensions indeed in the eyes of an iron-master.\n\n\"The lady was wealthy and beautiful, and had a liking for the girl,\nand treated her with great kindness, and kept her always near her.\nNow this lady preserved a secret under all her greatness, which she\nhad preserved for many years. In fact, she had in early life been\nengaged to marry a young rake--he was a captain in the army--nothing\nconnected with whom came to any good. She never did marry him, but\nshe gave birth to a child of which he was the father.\"\n\nBy the light of the fire he can be seen looking towards the\nmoonlight. By the moonlight, Lady Dedlock can be seen in profile,\nperfectly still.\n\n\"The captain in the army being dead, she believed herself safe; but a\ntrain of circumstances with which I need not trouble you led to\ndiscovery. As I received the story, they began in an imprudence on\nher own part one day when she was taken by surprise, which shows how\ndifficult it is for the firmest of us (she was very firm) to be\nalways guarded. There was great domestic trouble and amazement, you\nmay suppose; I leave you to imagine, Sir Leicester, the husband's\ngrief. But that is not the present point. When Mr. Rouncewell's\ntownsman heard of the disclosure, he no more allowed the girl to be\npatronized and honoured than he would have suffered her to be trodden\nunderfoot before his eyes. Such was his pride, that he indignantly\ntook her away, as if from reproach and disgrace. He had no sense of\nthe honour done him and his daughter by the lady's condescension; not\nthe least. He resented the girl's position, as if the lady had been\nthe commonest of commoners. That is the story. I hope Lady Dedlock\nwill excuse its painful nature.\"\n\nThere are various opinions on the merits, more or less conflicting\nwith Volumnia's. That fair young creature cannot believe there ever\nwas any such lady and rejects the whole history on the threshold. The\nmajority incline to the debilitated cousin's sentiment, which is in\nfew words--\"no business--Rouncewell's fernal townsman.\" Sir Leicester\ngenerally refers back in his mind to Wat Tyler and arranges a\nsequence of events on a plan of his own.\n\nThere is not much conversation in all, for late hours have been kept\nat Chesney Wold since the necessary expenses elsewhere began, and\nthis is the first night in many on which the family have been alone.\nIt is past ten when Sir Leicester begs Mr. Tulkinghorn to ring for\ncandles. Then the stream of moonlight has swelled into a lake, and\nthen Lady Dedlock for the first time moves, and rises, and comes\nforward to a table for a glass of water. Winking cousins, bat-like in\nthe candle glare, crowd round to give it; Volumnia (always ready for\nsomething better if procurable) takes another, a very mild sip of\nwhich contents her; Lady Dedlock, graceful, self-possessed, looked\nafter by admiring eyes, passes away slowly down the long perspective\nby the side of that nymph, not at all improving her as a question of\ncontrast.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLI\n\nIn Mr. Tulkinghorn's Room\n\n\nMr. Tulkinghorn arrives in his turret-room a little breathed by the\njourney up, though leisurely performed. There is an expression on his\nface as if he had discharged his mind of some grave matter and were,\nin his close way, satisfied. To say of a man so severely and strictly\nself-repressed that he is triumphant would be to do him as great an\ninjustice as to suppose him troubled with love or sentiment or any\nromantic weakness. He is sedately satisfied. Perhaps there is a\nrather increased sense of power upon him as he loosely grasps one of\nhis veinous wrists with his other hand and holding it behind his back\nwalks noiselessly up and down.\n\nThere is a capacious writing-table in the room on which is a pretty\nlarge accumulation of papers. The green lamp is lighted, his\nreading-glasses lie upon the desk, the easy-chair is wheeled up to\nit, and it would seem as though he had intended to bestow an hour or\nso upon these claims on his attention before going to bed. But he\nhappens not to be in a business mind. After a glance at the documents\nawaiting his notice--with his head bent low over the table, the old\nman's sight for print or writing being defective at night--he opens\nthe French window and steps out upon the leads. There he again walks\nslowly up and down in the same attitude, subsiding, if a man so cool\nmay have any need to subside, from the story he has related\ndownstairs.\n\nThe time was once when men as knowing as Mr. Tulkinghorn would walk\non turret-tops in the starlight and look up into the sky to read\ntheir fortunes there. Hosts of stars are visible to-night, though\ntheir brilliancy is eclipsed by the splendour of the moon. If he be\nseeking his own star as he methodically turns and turns upon the\nleads, it should be but a pale one to be so rustily represented\nbelow. If he be tracing out his destiny, that may be written in other\ncharacters nearer to his hand.\n\nAs he paces the leads with his eyes most probably as high above his\nthoughts as they are high above the earth, he is suddenly stopped in\npassing the window by two eyes that meet his own. The ceiling of his\nroom is rather low; and the upper part of the door, which is opposite\nthe window, is of glass. There is an inner baize door, too, but the\nnight being warm he did not close it when he came upstairs. These\neyes that meet his own are looking in through the glass from the\ncorridor outside. He knows them well. The blood has not flushed into\nhis face so suddenly and redly for many a long year as when he\nrecognizes Lady Dedlock.\n\nHe steps into the room, and she comes in too, closing both the doors\nbehind her. There is a wild disturbance--is it fear or anger?--in her\neyes. In her carriage and all else she looks as she looked downstairs\ntwo hours ago.\n\nIs it fear or is it anger now? He cannot be sure. Both might be as\npale, both as intent.\n\n\"Lady Dedlock?\"\n\nShe does not speak at first, nor even when she has slowly dropped\ninto the easy-chair by the table. They look at each other, like two\npictures.\n\n\"Why have you told my story to so many persons?\"\n\n\"Lady Dedlock, it was necessary for me to inform you that I knew it.\"\n\n\"How long have you known it?\"\n\n\"I have suspected it a long while--fully known it a little while.\"\n\n\"Months?\"\n\n\"Days.\"\n\nHe stands before her with one hand on a chair-back and the other in\nhis old-fashioned waistcoat and shirt-frill, exactly as he has stood\nbefore her at any time since her marriage. The same formal\npoliteness, the same composed deference that might as well be\ndefiance; the whole man the same dark, cold object, at the same\ndistance, which nothing has ever diminished.\n\n\"Is this true concerning the poor girl?\"\n\nHe slightly inclines and advances his head as not quite understanding\nthe question.\n\n\"You know what you related. Is it true? Do her friends know my story\nalso? Is it the town-talk yet? Is it chalked upon the walls and cried\nin the streets?\"\n\nSo! Anger, and fear, and shame. All three contending. What power this\nwoman has to keep these raging passions down! Mr. Tulkinghorn's\nthoughts take such form as he looks at her, with his ragged grey\neyebrows a hair's breadth more contracted than usual under her gaze.\n\n\"No, Lady Dedlock. That was a hypothetical case, arising out of Sir\nLeicester's unconsciously carrying the matter with so high a hand.\nBut it would be a real case if they knew--what we know.\"\n\n\"Then they do not know it yet?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Can I save the poor girl from injury before they know it?\"\n\n\"Really, Lady Dedlock,\" Mr. Tulkinghorn replies, \"I cannot give a\nsatisfactory opinion on that point.\"\n\nAnd he thinks, with the interest of attentive curiosity, as he\nwatches the struggle in her breast, \"The power and force of this\nwoman are astonishing!\"\n\n\"Sir,\" she says, for the moment obliged to set her lips with all the\nenergy she has, that she may speak distinctly, \"I will make it\nplainer. I do not dispute your hypothetical case. I anticipated it,\nand felt its truth as strongly as you can do, when I saw Mr.\nRouncewell here. I knew very well that if he could have had the power\nof seeing me as I was, he would consider the poor girl tarnished by\nhaving for a moment been, although most innocently, the subject of my\ngreat and distinguished patronage. But I have an interest in her, or\nI should rather say--no longer belonging to this place--I had, and if\nyou can find so much consideration for the woman under your foot as\nto remember that, she will be very sensible of your mercy.\"\n\nMr. Tulkinghorn, profoundly attentive, throws this off with a shrug\nof self-depreciation and contracts his eyebrows a little more.\n\n\"You have prepared me for my exposure, and I thank you for that too.\nIs there anything that you require of me? Is there any claim that I\ncan release or any charge or trouble that I can spare my husband in\nobtaining HIS release by certifying to the exactness of your\ndiscovery? I will write anything, here and now, that you will\ndictate. I am ready to do it.\"\n\nAnd she would do it, thinks the lawyer, watchful of the firm hand\nwith which she takes the pen!\n\n\"I will not trouble you, Lady Dedlock. Pray spare yourself.\"\n\n\"I have long expected this, as you know. I neither wish to spare\nmyself nor to be spared. You can do nothing worse to me than you have\ndone. Do what remains now.\"\n\n\"Lady Dedlock, there is nothing to be done. I will take leave to say\na few words when you have finished.\"\n\nTheir need for watching one another should be over now, but they do\nit all this time, and the stars watch them both through the opened\nwindow. Away in the moonlight lie the woodland fields at rest, and\nthe wide house is as quiet as the narrow one. The narrow one! Where\nare the digger and the spade, this peaceful night, destined to add\nthe last great secret to the many secrets of the Tulkinghorn\nexistence? Is the man born yet, is the spade wrought yet? Curious\nquestions to consider, more curious perhaps not to consider, under\nthe watching stars upon a summer night.\n\n\"Of repentance or remorse or any feeling of mine,\" Lady Dedlock\npresently proceeds, \"I say not a word. If I were not dumb, you would\nbe deaf. Let that go by. It is not for your ears.\"\n\nHe makes a feint of offering a protest, but she sweeps it away with\nher disdainful hand.\n\n\"Of other and very different things I come to speak to you. My jewels\nare all in their proper places of keeping. They will be found there.\nSo, my dresses. So, all the valuables I have. Some ready money I had\nwith me, please to say, but no large amount. I did not wear my own\ndress, in order that I might avoid observation. I went to be\nhenceforward lost. Make this known. I leave no other charge with\nyou.\"\n\n\"Excuse me, Lady Dedlock,\" says Mr. Tulkinghorn, quite unmoved. \"I am\nnot sure that I understand you. You want--\"\n\n\"To be lost to all here. I leave Chesney Wold to-night. I go this\nhour.\"\n\nMr. Tulkinghorn shakes his head. She rises, but he, without moving\nhand from chair-back or from old-fashioned waistcoat and shirt-frill,\nshakes his head.\n\n\"What? Not go as I have said?\"\n\n\"No, Lady Dedlock,\" he very calmly replies.\n\n\"Do you know the relief that my disappearance will be? Have you\nforgotten the stain and blot upon this place, and where it is, and\nwho it is?\"\n\n\"No, Lady Dedlock, not by any means.\"\n\nWithout deigning to rejoin, she moves to the inner door and has it in\nher hand when he says to her, without himself stirring hand or foot\nor raising his voice, \"Lady Dedlock, have the goodness to stop and\nhear me, or before you reach the staircase I shall ring the\nalarm-bell and rouse the house. And then I must speak out before\nevery guest and servant, every man and woman, in it.\"\n\nHe has conquered her. She falters, trembles, and puts her hand\nconfusedly to her head. Slight tokens these in any one else, but when\nso practised an eye as Mr. Tulkinghorn's sees indecision for a moment\nin such a subject, he thoroughly knows its value.\n\nHe promptly says again, \"Have the goodness to hear me, Lady Dedlock,\"\nand motions to the chair from which she has risen. She hesitates, but\nhe motions again, and she sits down.\n\n\"The relations between us are of an unfortunate description, Lady\nDedlock; but as they are not of my making, I will not apologize for\nthem. The position I hold in reference to Sir Leicester is so well\nknown to you that I can hardly imagine but that I must long have\nappeared in your eyes the natural person to make this discovery.\"\n\n\"Sir,\" she returns without looking up from the ground on which her\neyes are now fixed, \"I had better have gone. It would have been far\nbetter not to have detained me. I have no more to say.\"\n\n\"Excuse me, Lady Dedlock, if I add a little more to hear.\"\n\n\"I wish to hear it at the window, then. I can't breathe where I am.\"\n\nHis jealous glance as she walks that way betrays an instant's\nmisgiving that she may have it in her thoughts to leap over, and\ndashing against ledge and cornice, strike her life out upon the\nterrace below. But a moment's observation of her figure as she stands\nin the window without any support, looking out at the stars--not\nup--gloomily out at those stars which are low in the heavens,\nreassures him. By facing round as she has moved, he stands a little\nbehind her.\n\n\"Lady Dedlock, I have not yet been able to come to a decision\nsatisfactory to myself on the course before me. I am not clear what\nto do or how to act next. I must request you, in the meantime, to\nkeep your secret as you have kept it so long and not to wonder that I\nkeep it too.\"\n\nHe pauses, but she makes no reply.\n\n\"Pardon me, Lady Dedlock. This is an important subject. You are\nhonouring me with your attention?\"\n\n\"I am.\"\n\n\"Thank you. I might have known it from what I have seen of your\nstrength of character. I ought not to have asked the question, but I\nhave the habit of making sure of my ground, step by step, as I go on.\nThe sole consideration in this unhappy case is Sir Leicester.\"\n\n\"Then why,\" she asks in a low voice and without removing her gloomy\nlook from those distant stars, \"do you detain me in his house?\"\n\n\"Because he IS the consideration. Lady Dedlock, I have no occasion to\ntell you that Sir Leicester is a very proud man, that his reliance\nupon you is implicit, that the fall of that moon out of the sky would\nnot amaze him more than your fall from your high position as his\nwife.\"\n\nShe breathes quickly and heavily, but she stands as unflinchingly as\never he has seen her in the midst of her grandest company.\n\n\"I declare to you, Lady Dedlock, that with anything short of this\ncase that I have, I would as soon have hoped to root up by means of\nmy own strength and my own hands the oldest tree on this estate as to\nshake your hold upon Sir Leicester and Sir Leicester's trust and\nconfidence in you. And even now, with this case, I hesitate. Not that\nhe could doubt (that, even with him, is impossible), but that nothing\ncan prepare him for the blow.\"\n\n\"Not my flight?\" she returned. \"Think of it again.\"\n\n\"Your flight, Lady Dedlock, would spread the whole truth, and a\nhundred times the whole truth, far and wide. It would be impossible\nto save the family credit for a day. It is not to be thought of.\"\n\nThere is a quiet decision in his reply which admits of no\nremonstrance.\n\n\"When I speak of Sir Leicester being the sole consideration, he and\nthe family credit are one. Sir Leicester and the baronetcy, Sir\nLeicester and Chesney Wold, Sir Leicester and his ancestors and his\npatrimony\"--Mr. Tulkinghorn very dry here--\"are, I need not say to\nyou, Lady Dedlock, inseparable.\"\n\n\"Go on!\"\n\n\"Therefore,\" says Mr. Tulkinghorn, pursuing his case in his jog-trot\nstyle, \"I have much to consider. This is to be hushed up if it can\nbe. How can it be, if Sir Leicester is driven out of his wits or laid\nupon a death-bed? If I inflicted this shock upon him to-morrow\nmorning, how could the immediate change in him be accounted for? What\ncould have caused it? What could have divided you? Lady Dedlock, the\nwall-chalking and the street-crying would come on directly, and you\nare to remember that it would not affect you merely (whom I cannot at\nall consider in this business) but your husband, Lady Dedlock, your\nhusband.\"\n\nHe gets plainer as he gets on, but not an atom more emphatic or\nanimated.\n\n\"There is another point of view,\" he continues, \"in which the case\npresents itself. Sir Leicester is devoted to you almost to\ninfatuation. He might not be able to overcome that infatuation, even\nknowing what we know. I am putting an extreme case, but it might be\nso. If so, it were better that he knew nothing. Better for common\nsense, better for him, better for me. I must take all this into\naccount, and it combines to render a decision very difficult.\"\n\nShe stands looking out at the same stars without a word. They are\nbeginning to pale, and she looks as if their coldness froze her.\n\n\"My experience teaches me,\" says Mr. Tulkinghorn, who has by this\ntime got his hands in his pockets and is going on in his business\nconsideration of the matter like a machine. \"My experience teaches\nme, Lady Dedlock, that most of the people I know would do far better\nto leave marriage alone. It is at the bottom of three fourths of\ntheir troubles. So I thought when Sir Leicester married, and so I\nalways have thought since. No more about that. I must now be guided\nby circumstances. In the meanwhile I must beg you to keep your own\ncounsel, and I will keep mine.\"\n\n\"I am to drag my present life on, holding its pains at your pleasure,\nday by day?\" she asks, still looking at the distant sky.\n\n\"Yes, I am afraid so, Lady Dedlock.\"\n\n\"It is necessary, you think, that I should be so tied to the stake?\"\n\n\"I am sure that what I recommend is necessary.\"\n\n\"I am to remain on this gaudy platform on which my miserable\ndeception has been so long acted, and it is to fall beneath me when\nyou give the signal?\" she said slowly.\n\n\"Not without notice, Lady Dedlock. I shall take no step without\nforewarning you.\"\n\nShe asks all her questions as if she were repeating them from memory\nor calling them over in her sleep.\n\n\"We are to meet as usual?\"\n\n\"Precisely as usual, if you please.\"\n\n\"And I am to hide my guilt, as I have done so many years?\"\n\n\"As you have done so many years. I should not have made that\nreference myself, Lady Dedlock, but I may now remind you that your\nsecret can be no heavier to you than it was, and is no worse and no\nbetter than it was. I know it certainly, but I believe we have never\nwholly trusted each other.\"\n\nShe stands absorbed in the same frozen way for some little time\nbefore asking, \"Is there anything more to be said to-night?\"\n\n\"Why,\" Mr. Tulkinghorn returns methodically as he softly rubs his\nhands, \"I should like to be assured of your acquiescence in my\narrangements, Lady Dedlock.\"\n\n\"You may be assured of it.\"\n\n\"Good. And I would wish in conclusion to remind you, as a business\nprecaution, in case it should be necessary to recall the fact in any\ncommunication with Sir Leicester, that throughout our interview I\nhave expressly stated my sole consideration to be Sir Leicester's\nfeelings and honour and the family reputation. I should have been\nhappy to have made Lady Dedlock a prominent consideration, too, if\nthe case had admitted of it; but unfortunately it does not.\"\n\n\"I can attest your fidelity, sir.\"\n\nBoth before and after saying it she remains absorbed, but at length\nmoves, and turns, unshaken in her natural and acquired presence,\ntowards the door. Mr. Tulkinghorn opens both the doors exactly as he\nwould have done yesterday, or as he would have done ten years ago,\nand makes his old-fashioned bow as she passes out. It is not an\nordinary look that he receives from the handsome face as it goes into\nthe darkness, and it is not an ordinary movement, though a very\nslight one, that acknowledges his courtesy. But as he reflects when\nhe is left alone, the woman has been putting no common constraint\nupon herself.\n\nHe would know it all the better if he saw the woman pacing her own\nrooms with her hair wildly thrown from her flung-back face, her hands\nclasped behind her head, her figure twisted as if by pain. He would\nthink so all the more if he saw the woman thus hurrying up and down\nfor hours, without fatigue, without intermission, followed by the\nfaithful step upon the Ghost's Walk. But he shuts out the now chilled\nair, draws the window-curtain, goes to bed, and falls asleep. And\ntruly when the stars go out and the wan day peeps into the\nturret-chamber, finding him at his oldest, he looks as if the digger\nand the spade were both commissioned and would soon be digging.\n\nThe same wan day peeps in at Sir Leicester pardoning the repentant\ncountry in a majestically condescending dream; and at the cousins\nentering on various public employments, principally receipt of\nsalary; and at the chaste Volumnia, bestowing a dower of fifty\nthousand pounds upon a hideous old general with a mouth of false\nteeth like a pianoforte too full of keys, long the admiration of Bath\nand the terror of every other community. Also into rooms high in the\nroof, and into offices in court-yards, and over stables, where\nhumbler ambition dreams of bliss, in keepers' lodges, and in holy\nmatrimony with Will or Sally. Up comes the bright sun, drawing\neverything up with it--the Wills and Sallys, the latent vapour in the\nearth, the drooping leaves and flowers, the birds and beasts and\ncreeping things, the gardeners to sweep the dewy turf and unfold\nemerald velvet where the roller passes, the smoke of the great\nkitchen fire wreathing itself straight and high into the lightsome\nair. Lastly, up comes the flag over Mr. Tulkinghorn's unconscious\nhead cheerfully proclaiming that Sir Leicester and Lady Dedlock are\nin their happy home and that there is hospitality at the place in\nLincolnshire.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLII\n\nIn Mr. Tulkinghorn's Chambers\n\n\nFrom the verdant undulations and the spreading oaks of the Dedlock\nproperty, Mr. Tulkinghorn transfers himself to the stale heat and\ndust of London. His manner of coming and going between the two places\nis one of his impenetrabilities. He walks into Chesney Wold as if it\nwere next door to his chambers and returns to his chambers as if he\nhad never been out of Lincoln's Inn Fields. He neither changes his\ndress before the journey nor talks of it afterwards. He melted out of\nhis turret-room this morning, just as now, in the late twilight, he\nmelts into his own square.\n\nLike a dingy London bird among the birds at roost in these pleasant\nfields, where the sheep are all made into parchment, the goats into\nwigs, and the pasture into chaff, the lawyer, smoke-dried and faded,\ndwelling among mankind but not consorting with them, aged without\nexperience of genial youth, and so long used to make his cramped nest\nin holes and corners of human nature that he has forgotten its\nbroader and better range, comes sauntering home. In the oven made by\nthe hot pavements and hot buildings, he has baked himself dryer than\nusual; and he has in his thirsty mind his mellowed port-wine half a\ncentury old.\n\nThe lamplighter is skipping up and down his ladder on Mr.\nTulkinghorn's side of the Fields when that high-priest of noble\nmysteries arrives at his own dull court-yard. He ascends the\ndoor-steps and is gliding into the dusky hall when he encounters, on\nthe top step, a bowing and propitiatory little man.\n\n\"Is that Snagsby?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir. I hope you are well, sir. I was just giving you up, sir,\nand going home.\"\n\n\"Aye? What is it? What do you want with me?\"\n\n\"Well, sir,\" says Mr. Snagsby, holding his hat at the side of his\nhead in his deference towards his best customer, \"I was wishful to\nsay a word to you, sir.\"\n\n\"Can you say it here?\"\n\n\"Perfectly, sir.\"\n\n\"Say it then.\" The lawyer turns, leans his arms on the iron railing\nat the top of the steps, and looks at the lamplighter lighting the\ncourt-yard.\n\n\"It is relating,\" says Mr. Snagsby in a mysterious low voice, \"it is\nrelating--not to put too fine a point upon it--to the foreigner,\nsir!\"\n\nMr. Tulkinghorn eyes him with some surprise. \"What foreigner?\"\n\n\"The foreign female, sir. French, if I don't mistake? I am not\nacquainted with that language myself, but I should judge from her\nmanners and appearance that she was French; anyways, certainly\nforeign. Her that was upstairs, sir, when Mr. Bucket and me had the\nhonour of waiting upon you with the sweeping-boy that night.\"\n\n\"Oh! Yes, yes. Mademoiselle Hortense.\"\n\n\"Indeed, sir?\" Mr. Snagsby coughs his cough of submission behind his\nhat. \"I am not acquainted myself with the names of foreigners in\ngeneral, but I have no doubt it WOULD be that.\" Mr. Snagsby appears\nto have set out in this reply with some desperate design of repeating\nthe name, but on reflection coughs again to excuse himself.\n\n\"And what can you have to say, Snagsby,\" demands Mr. Tulkinghorn,\n\"about her?\"\n\n\"Well, sir,\" returns the stationer, shading his communication with\nhis hat, \"it falls a little hard upon me. My domestic happiness is\nvery great--at least, it's as great as can be expected, I'm sure--but\nmy little woman is rather given to jealousy. Not to put too fine a\npoint upon it, she is very much given to jealousy. And you see, a\nforeign female of that genteel appearance coming into the shop, and\nhovering--I should be the last to make use of a strong expression if\nI could avoid it, but hovering, sir--in the court--you know it\nis--now ain't it? I only put it to yourself, sir.\"\n\nMr. Snagsby, having said this in a very plaintive manner, throws in a\ncough of general application to fill up all the blanks.\n\n\"Why, what do you mean?\" asks Mr. Tulkinghorn.\n\n\"Just so, sir,\" returns Mr. Snagsby; \"I was sure you would feel it\nyourself and would excuse the reasonableness of MY feelings when\ncoupled with the known excitableness of my little woman. You see, the\nforeign female--which you mentioned her name just now, with quite a\nnative sound I am sure--caught up the word Snagsby that night, being\nuncommon quick, and made inquiry, and got the direction and come at\ndinner-time. Now Guster, our young woman, is timid and has fits, and\nshe, taking fright at the foreigner's looks--which are fierce--and at\na grinding manner that she has of speaking--which is calculated to\nalarm a weak mind--gave way to it, instead of bearing up against it,\nand tumbled down the kitchen stairs out of one into another, such\nfits as I do sometimes think are never gone into, or come out of, in\nany house but ours. Consequently there was by good fortune ample\noccupation for my little woman, and only me to answer the shop. When\nshe DID say that Mr. Tulkinghorn, being always denied to her by his\nemployer (which I had no doubt at the time was a foreign mode of\nviewing a clerk), she would do herself the pleasure of continually\ncalling at my place until she was let in here. Since then she has\nbeen, as I began by saying, hovering, hovering, sir\"--Mr. Snagsby\nrepeats the word with pathetic emphasis--\"in the court. The effects\nof which movement it is impossible to calculate. I shouldn't wonder\nif it might have already given rise to the painfullest mistakes even\nin the neighbours' minds, not mentioning (if such a thing was\npossible) my little woman. Whereas, goodness knows,\" says Mr.\nSnagsby, shaking his head, \"I never had an idea of a foreign female,\nexcept as being formerly connected with a bunch of brooms and a baby,\nor at the present time with a tambourine and earrings. I never had, I\ndo assure you, sir!\"\n\nMr. Tulkinghorn had listened gravely to this complaint and inquires\nwhen the stationer has finished, \"And that's all, is it, Snagsby?\"\n\n\"Why yes, sir, that's all,\" says Mr. Snagsby, ending with a cough\nthat plainly adds, \"and it's enough too--for me.\"\n\n\"I don't know what Mademoiselle Hortense may want or mean, unless she\nis mad,\" says the lawyer.\n\n\"Even if she was, you know, sir,\" Mr. Snagsby pleads, \"it wouldn't be\na consolation to have some weapon or another in the form of a foreign\ndagger planted in the family.\"\n\n\"No,\" says the other. \"Well, well! This shall be stopped. I am sorry\nyou have been inconvenienced. If she comes again, send her here.\"\n\nMr. Snagsby, with much bowing and short apologetic coughing, takes\nhis leave, lightened in heart. Mr. Tulkinghorn goes upstairs, saying\nto himself, \"These women were created to give trouble the whole earth\nover. The mistress not being enough to deal with, here's the maid\nnow! But I will be short with THIS jade at least!\"\n\nSo saying, he unlocks his door, gropes his way into his murky rooms,\nlights his candles, and looks about him. It is too dark to see much\nof the Allegory overhead there, but that importunate Roman, who is\nfor ever toppling out of the clouds and pointing, is at his old work\npretty distinctly. Not honouring him with much attention, Mr.\nTulkinghorn takes a small key from his pocket, unlocks a drawer in\nwhich there is another key, which unlocks a chest in which there is\nanother, and so comes to the cellar-key, with which he prepares to\ndescend to the regions of old wine. He is going towards the door with\na candle in his hand when a knock comes.\n\n\"Who's this? Aye, aye, mistress, it's you, is it? You appear at a\ngood time. I have just been hearing of you. Now! What do you want?\"\n\nHe stands the candle on the chimney-piece in the clerk's hall and\ntaps his dry cheek with the key as he addresses these words of\nwelcome to Mademoiselle Hortense. That feline personage, with her\nlips tightly shut and her eyes looking out at him sideways, softly\ncloses the door before replying.\n\n\"I have had great deal of trouble to find you, sir.\"\n\n\"HAVE you!\"\n\n\"I have been here very often, sir. It has always been said to me, he\nis not at home, he is engage, he is this and that, he is not for\nyou.\"\n\n\"Quite right, and quite true.\"\n\n\"Not true. Lies!\"\n\nAt times there is a suddenness in the manner of Mademoiselle Hortense\nso like a bodily spring upon the subject of it that such subject\ninvoluntarily starts and fails back. It is Mr. Tulkinghorn's case at\npresent, though Mademoiselle Hortense, with her eyes almost shut up\n(but still looking out sideways), is only smiling contemptuously and\nshaking her head.\n\n\"Now, mistress,\" says the lawyer, tapping the key hastily upon the\nchimney-piece. \"If you have anything to say, say it, say it.\"\n\n\"Sir, you have not use me well. You have been mean and shabby.\"\n\n\"Mean and shabby, eh?\" returns the lawyer, rubbing his nose with the\nkey.\n\n\"Yes. What is it that I tell you? You know you have. You have\nattrapped me--catched me--to give you information; you have asked me\nto show you the dress of mine my Lady must have wore that night, you\nhave prayed me to come in it here to meet that boy. Say! Is it not?\"\nMademoiselle Hortense makes another spring.\n\n\"You are a vixen, a vixen!\" Mr. Tulkinghorn seems to meditate as he\nlooks distrustfully at her, then he replies, \"Well, wench, well. I\npaid you.\"\n\n\"You paid me!\" she repeats with fierce disdain. \"Two sovereign! I\nhave not change them, I re-fuse them, I des-pise them, I throw them\nfrom me!\" Which she literally does, taking them out of her bosom as\nshe speaks and flinging them with such violence on the floor that\nthey jerk up again into the light before they roll away into corners\nand slowly settle down there after spinning vehemently.\n\n\"Now!\" says Mademoiselle Hortense, darkening her large eyes again.\n\"You have paid me? Eh, my God, oh yes!\"\n\nMr. Tulkinghorn rubs his head with the key while she entertains\nherself with a sarcastic laugh.\n\n\"You must be rich, my fair friend,\" he composedly observes, \"to throw\nmoney about in that way!\"\n\n\"I AM rich,\" she returns. \"I am very rich in hate. I hate my Lady, of\nall my heart. You know that.\"\n\n\"Know it? How should I know it?\"\n\n\"Because you have known it perfectly before you prayed me to give you\nthat information. Because you have known perfectly that I was\nen-r-r-r-raged!\" It appears impossible for mademoiselle to roll the\nletter \"r\" sufficiently in this word, notwithstanding that she\nassists her energetic delivery by clenching both her hands and\nsetting all her teeth.\n\n\"Oh! I knew that, did I?\" says Mr. Tulkinghorn, examining the wards\nof the key.\n\n\"Yes, without doubt. I am not blind. You have made sure of me because\nyou knew that. You had reason! I det-est her.\" Mademoiselle folds her\narms and throws this last remark at him over one of her shoulders.\n\n\"Having said this, have you anything else to say, mademoiselle?\"\n\n\"I am not yet placed. Place me well. Find me a good condition! If you\ncannot, or do not choose to do that, employ me to pursue her, to\nchase her, to disgrace and to dishonour her. I will help you well,\nand with a good will. It is what YOU do. Do I not know that?\"\n\n\"You appear to know a good deal,\" Mr. Tulkinghorn retorts.\n\n\"Do I not? Is it that I am so weak as to believe, like a child, that\nI come here in that dress to rec-eive that boy only to decide a\nlittle bet, a wager? Eh, my God, oh yes!\" In this reply, down to the\nword \"wager\" inclusive, mademoiselle has been ironically polite and\ntender, then as suddenly dashed into the bitterest and most defiant\nscorn, with her black eyes in one and the same moment very nearly\nshut and staringly wide open.\n\n\"Now, let us see,\" says Mr. Tulkinghorn, tapping his chin with the\nkey and looking imperturbably at her, \"how this matter stands.\"\n\n\"Ah! Let us see,\" mademoiselle assents, with many angry and tight\nnods of her head.\n\n\"You come here to make a remarkably modest demand, which you have\njust stated, and it not being conceded, you will come again.\"\n\n\"And again,\" says mademoiselle with more tight and angry nods. \"And\nyet again. And yet again. And many times again. In effect, for ever!\"\n\n\"And not only here, but you will go to Mr. Snagsby's too, perhaps?\nThat visit not succeeding either, you will go again perhaps?\"\n\n\"And again,\" repeats mademoiselle, cataleptic with determination.\n\"And yet again. And yet again. And many times again. In effect, for\never!\"\n\n\"Very well. Now, Mademoiselle Hortense, let me recommend you to take\nthe candle and pick up that money of yours. I think you will find it\nbehind the clerk's partition in the corner yonder.\"\n\nShe merely throws a laugh over her shoulder and stands her ground\nwith folded arms.\n\n\"You will not, eh?\"\n\n\"No, I will not!\"\n\n\"So much the poorer you; so much the richer I! Look, mistress, this\nis the key of my wine-cellar. It is a large key, but the keys of\nprisons are larger. In this city there are houses of correction\n(where the treadmills are, for women), the gates of which are very\nstrong and heavy, and no doubt the keys too. I am afraid a lady of\nyour spirit and activity would find it an inconvenience to have one\nof those keys turned upon her for any length of time. What do you\nthink?\"\n\n\"I think,\" mademoiselle replies without any action and in a clear,\nobliging voice, \"that you are a miserable wretch.\"\n\n\"Probably,\" returns Mr. Tulkinghorn, quietly blowing his nose. \"But I\ndon't ask what you think of myself; I ask what you think of the\nprison.\"\n\n\"Nothing. What does it matter to me?\"\n\n\"Why, it matters this much, mistress,\" says the lawyer, deliberately\nputting away his handkerchief and adjusting his frill; \"the law is so\ndespotic here that it interferes to prevent any of our good English\ncitizens from being troubled, even by a lady's visits against his\ndesire. And on his complaining that he is so troubled, it takes hold\nof the troublesome lady and shuts her up in prison under hard\ndiscipline. Turns the key upon her, mistress.\" Illustrating with the\ncellar-key.\n\n\"Truly?\" returns mademoiselle in the same pleasant voice. \"That is\ndroll! But--my faith!--still what does it matter to me?\"\n\n\"My fair friend,\" says Mr. Tulkinghorn, \"make another visit here, or\nat Mr. Snagsby's, and you shall learn.\"\n\n\"In that case you will send me to the prison, perhaps?\"\n\n\"Perhaps.\"\n\nIt would be contradictory for one in mademoiselle's state of\nagreeable jocularity to foam at the mouth, otherwise a tigerish\nexpansion thereabouts might look as if a very little more would make\nher do it.\n\n\"In a word, mistress,\" says Mr. Tulkinghorn, \"I am sorry to be\nunpolite, but if you ever present yourself uninvited here--or\nthere--again, I will give you over to the police. Their gallantry is\ngreat, but they carry troublesome people through the streets in an\nignominious manner, strapped down on a board, my good wench.\"\n\n\"I will prove you,\" whispers mademoiselle, stretching out her hand,\n\"I will try if you dare to do it!\"\n\n\"And if,\" pursues the lawyer without minding her, \"I place you in\nthat good condition of being locked up in jail, it will be some time\nbefore you find yourself at liberty again.\"\n\n\"I will prove you,\" repeats mademoiselle in her former whisper.\n\n\"And now,\" proceeds the lawyer, still without minding her, \"you had\nbetter go. Think twice before you come here again.\"\n\n\"Think you,\" she answers, \"twice two hundred times!\"\n\n\"You were dismissed by your lady, you know,\" Mr. Tulkinghorn\nobserves, following her out upon the staircase, \"as the most\nimplacable and unmanageable of women. Now turn over a new leaf and\ntake warning by what I say to you. For what I say, I mean; and what I\nthreaten, I will do, mistress.\"\n\nShe goes down without answering or looking behind her. When she is\ngone, he goes down too, and returning with his cobweb-covered bottle,\ndevotes himself to a leisurely enjoyment of its contents, now and\nthen, as he throws his head back in his chair, catching sight of the\npertinacious Roman pointing from the ceiling.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLIII\n\nEsther's Narrative\n\n\nIt matters little now how much I thought of my living mother who had\ntold me evermore to consider her dead. I could not venture to\napproach her or to communicate with her in writing, for my sense of\nthe peril in which her life was passed was only to be equalled by my\nfears of increasing it. Knowing that my mere existence as a living\ncreature was an unforeseen danger in her way, I could not always\nconquer that terror of myself which had seized me when I first knew\nthe secret. At no time did I dare to utter her name. I felt as if I\ndid not even dare to hear it. If the conversation anywhere, when I\nwas present, took that direction, as it sometimes naturally did, I\ntried not to hear: I mentally counted, repeated something that I\nknew, or went out of the room. I am conscious now that I often did\nthese things when there can have been no danger of her being spoken\nof, but I did them in the dread I had of hearing anything that might\nlead to her betrayal, and to her betrayal through me.\n\nIt matters little now how often I recalled the tones of my mother's\nvoice, wondered whether I should ever hear it again as I so longed to\ndo, and thought how strange and desolate it was that it should be so\nnew to me. It matters little that I watched for every public mention\nof my mother's name; that I passed and repassed the door of her house\nin town, loving it, but afraid to look at it; that I once sat in the\ntheatre when my mother was there and saw me, and when we were so wide\nasunder before the great company of all degrees that any link or\nconfidence between us seemed a dream. It is all, all over. My lot has\nbeen so blest that I can relate little of myself which is not a story\nof goodness and generosity in others. I may well pass that little and\ngo on.\n\nWhen we were settled at home again, Ada and I had many conversations\nwith my guardian of which Richard was the theme. My dear girl was\ndeeply grieved that he should do their kind cousin so much wrong, but\nshe was so faithful to Richard that she could not bear to blame him\neven for that. My guardian was assured of it, and never coupled his\nname with a word of reproof. \"Rick is mistaken, my dear,\" he would\nsay to her. \"Well, well! We have all been mistaken over and over\nagain. We must trust to you and time to set him right.\"\n\nWe knew afterwards what we suspected then, that he did not trust to\ntime until he had often tried to open Richard's eyes. That he had\nwritten to him, gone to him, talked with him, tried every gentle and\npersuasive art his kindness could devise. Our poor devoted Richard\nwas deaf and blind to all. If he were wrong, he would make amends\nwhen the Chancery suit was over. If he were groping in the dark,\nhe could not do better than do his utmost to clear away those\nclouds in which so much was confused and obscured. Suspicion and\nmisunderstanding were the fault of the suit? Then let him work the\nsuit out and come through it to his right mind. This was his\nunvarying reply. Jarndyce and Jarndyce had obtained such possession\nof his whole nature that it was impossible to place any consideration\nbefore him which he did not, with a distorted kind of reason, make a\nnew argument in favour of his doing what he did. \"So that it is even\nmore mischievous,\" said my guardian once to me, \"to remonstrate with\nthe poor dear fellow than to leave him alone.\"\n\nI took one of these opportunities of mentioning my doubts of Mr.\nSkimpole as a good adviser for Richard.\n\n\"Adviser!\" returned my guardian, laughing, \"My dear, who would advise\nwith Skimpole?\"\n\n\"Encourager would perhaps have been a better word,\" said I.\n\n\"Encourager!\" returned my guardian again. \"Who could be encouraged by\nSkimpole?\"\n\n\"Not Richard?\" I asked.\n\n\"No,\" he replied. \"Such an unworldly, uncalculating, gossamer\ncreature is a relief to him and an amusement. But as to advising or\nencouraging or occupying a serious station towards anybody or\nanything, it is simply not to be thought of in such a child as\nSkimpole.\"\n\n\"Pray, cousin John,\" said Ada, who had just joined us and now looked\nover my shoulder, \"what made him such a child?\"\n\n\"What made him such a child?\" inquired my guardian, rubbing his head,\na little at a loss.\n\n\"Yes, cousin John.\"\n\n\"Why,\" he slowly replied, roughening his head more and more, \"he is\nall sentiment, and--and susceptibility, and--and sensibility,\nand--and imagination. And these qualities are not regulated in him,\nsomehow. I suppose the people who admired him for them in his youth\nattached too much importance to them and too little to any training\nthat would have balanced and adjusted them, and so he became what he\nis. Hey?\" said my guardian, stopping short and looking at us\nhopefully. \"What do you think, you two?\"\n\nAda, glancing at me, said she thought it was a pity he should be an\nexpense to Richard.\n\n\"So it is, so it is,\" returned my guardian hurriedly. \"That must not\nbe. We must arrange that. I must prevent it. That will never do.\"\n\nAnd I said I thought it was to be regretted that he had ever\nintroduced Richard to Mr. Vholes for a present of five pounds.\n\n\"Did he?\" said my guardian with a passing shade of vexation on his\nface. \"But there you have the man. There you have the man! There is\nnothing mercenary in that with him. He has no idea of the value of\nmoney. He introduces Rick, and then he is good friends with Mr.\nVholes and borrows five pounds of him. He means nothing by it and\nthinks nothing of it. He told you himself, I'll be bound, my dear?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes!\" said I.\n\n\"Exactly!\" cried my guardian, quite triumphant. \"There you have the\nman! If he had meant any harm by it or was conscious of any harm in\nit, he wouldn't tell it. He tells it as he does it in mere\nsimplicity. But you shall see him in his own home, and then you'll\nunderstand him better. We must pay a visit to Harold Skimpole and\ncaution him on these points. Lord bless you, my dears, an infant, an\ninfant!\"\n\nIn pursuance of this plan, we went into London on an early day and\npresented ourselves at Mr. Skimpole's door.\n\nHe lived in a place called the Polygon, in Somers Town, where there\nwere at that time a number of poor Spanish refugees walking about in\ncloaks, smoking little paper cigars. Whether he was a better tenant\nthan one might have supposed, in consequence of his friend Somebody\nalways paying his rent at last, or whether his inaptitude for\nbusiness rendered it particularly difficult to turn him out, I don't\nknow; but he had occupied the same house some years. It was in a\nstate of dilapidation quite equal to our expectation. Two or three of\nthe area railings were gone, the water-butt was broken, the knocker\nwas loose, the bell-handle had been pulled off a long time to judge\nfrom the rusty state of the wire, and dirty footprints on the steps\nwere the only signs of its being inhabited.\n\nA slatternly full-blown girl who seemed to be bursting out at the\nrents in her gown and the cracks in her shoes like an over-ripe berry\nanswered our knock by opening the door a very little way and stopping\nup the gap with her figure. As she knew Mr. Jarndyce (indeed Ada and\nI both thought that she evidently associated him with the receipt of\nher wages), she immediately relented and allowed us to pass in. The\nlock of the door being in a disabled condition, she then applied\nherself to securing it with the chain, which was not in good action\neither, and said would we go upstairs?\n\nWe went upstairs to the first floor, still seeing no other furniture\nthan the dirty footprints. Mr. Jarndyce without further ceremony\nentered a room there, and we followed. It was dingy enough and not at\nall clean, but furnished with an odd kind of shabby luxury, with a\nlarge footstool, a sofa, and plenty of cushions, an easy-chair, and\nplenty of pillows, a piano, books, drawing materials, music,\nnewspapers, and a few sketches and pictures. A broken pane of glass\nin one of the dirty windows was papered and wafered over, but there\nwas a little plate of hothouse nectarines on the table, and there was\nanother of grapes, and another of sponge-cakes, and there was a\nbottle of light wine. Mr. Skimpole himself reclined upon the sofa in\na dressing-gown, drinking some fragrant coffee from an old china\ncup--it was then about mid-day--and looking at a collection of\nwallflowers in the balcony.\n\nHe was not in the least disconcerted by our appearance, but rose and\nreceived us in his usual airy manner.\n\n\"Here I am, you see!\" he said when we were seated, not without some\nlittle difficulty, the greater part of the chairs being broken. \"Here\nI am! This is my frugal breakfast. Some men want legs of beef and\nmutton for breakfast; I don't. Give me my peach, my cup of coffee,\nand my claret; I am content. I don't want them for themselves, but\nthey remind me of the sun. There's nothing solar about legs of beef\nand mutton. Mere animal satisfaction!\"\n\n\"This is our friend's consulting-room (or would be, if he ever\nprescribed), his sanctum, his studio,\" said my guardian to us.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Mr. Skimpole, turning his bright face about, \"this is the\nbird's cage. This is where the bird lives and sings. They pluck his\nfeathers now and then and clip his wings, but he sings, he sings!\"\n\nHe handed us the grapes, repeating in his radiant way, \"He sings! Not\nan ambitious note, but still he sings.\"\n\n\"These are very fine,\" said my guardian. \"A present?\"\n\n\"No,\" he answered. \"No! Some amiable gardener sells them. His man\nwanted to know, when he brought them last evening, whether he should\nwait for the money. 'Really, my friend,' I said, 'I think not--if\nyour time is of any value to you.' I suppose it was, for he went\naway.\"\n\nMy guardian looked at us with a smile, as though he asked us, \"Is it\npossible to be worldly with this baby?\"\n\n\"This is a day,\" said Mr. Skimpole, gaily taking a little claret in a\ntumbler, \"that will ever be remembered here. We shall call it Saint\nClare and Saint Summerson day. You must see my daughters. I have a\nblue-eyed daughter who is my Beauty daughter, I have a Sentiment\ndaughter, and I have a Comedy daughter. You must see them all.\nThey'll be enchanted.\"\n\nHe was going to summon them when my guardian interposed and asked him\nto pause a moment, as he wished to say a word to him first. \"My dear\nJarndyce,\" he cheerfully replied, going back to his sofa, \"as many\nmoments as you please. Time is no object here. We never know what\no'clock it is, and we never care. Not the way to get on in life,\nyou'll tell me? Certainly. But we DON'T get on in life. We don't\npretend to do it.\"\n\nMy guardian looked at us again, plainly saying, \"You hear him?\"\n\n\"Now, Harold,\" he began, \"the word I have to say relates to Rick.\"\n\n\"The dearest friend I have!\" returned Mr. Skimpole cordially. \"I\nsuppose he ought not to be my dearest friend, as he is not on terms\nwith you. But he is, I can't help it; he is full of youthful poetry,\nand I love him. If you don't like it, I can't help it. I love him.\"\n\nThe engaging frankness with which he made this declaration really had\na disinterested appearance and captivated my guardian, if not, for\nthe moment, Ada too.\n\n\"You are welcome to love him as much as you like,\" returned Mr.\nJarndyce, \"but we must save his pocket, Harold.\"\n\n\"Oh!\" said Mr. Skimpole. \"His pocket? Now you are coming to what I\ndon't understand.\" Taking a little more claret and dipping one of the\ncakes in it, he shook his head and smiled at Ada and me with an\ningenuous foreboding that he never could be made to understand.\n\n\"If you go with him here or there,\" said my guardian plainly, \"you\nmust not let him pay for both.\"\n\n\"My dear Jarndyce,\" returned Mr. Skimpole, his genial face irradiated\nby the comicality of this idea, \"what am I to do? If he takes me\nanywhere, I must go. And how can I pay? I never have any money. If I\nhad any money, I don't know anything about it. Suppose I say to a\nman, how much? Suppose the man says to me seven and sixpence? I know\nnothing about seven and sixpence. It is impossible for me to pursue\nthe subject with any consideration for the man. I don't go about\nasking busy people what seven and sixpence is in Moorish--which I\ndon't understand. Why should I go about asking them what seven and\nsixpence is in Money--which I don't understand?\"\n\n\"Well,\" said my guardian, by no means displeased with this artless\nreply, \"if you come to any kind of journeying with Rick, you must\nborrow the money of me (never breathing the least allusion to that\ncircumstance), and leave the calculation to him.\"\n\n\"My dear Jarndyce,\" returned Mr. Skimpole, \"I will do anything to\ngive you pleasure, but it seems an idle form--a superstition.\nBesides, I give you my word, Miss Clare and my dear Miss Summerson, I\nthought Mr. Carstone was immensely rich. I thought he had only to\nmake over something, or to sign a bond, or a draft, or a cheque, or a\nbill, or to put something on a file somewhere, to bring down a shower\nof money.\"\n\n\"Indeed it is not so, sir,\" said Ada. \"He is poor.\"\n\n\"No, really?\" returned Mr. Skimpole with his bright smile. \"You\nsurprise me.\n\n\"And not being the richer for trusting in a rotten reed,\" said my\nguardian, laying his hand emphatically on the sleeve of Mr.\nSkimpole's dressing-gown, \"be you very careful not to encourage him\nin that reliance, Harold.\"\n\n\"My dear good friend,\" returned Mr. Skimpole, \"and my dear Miss\nSimmerson, and my dear Miss Clare, how can I do that? It's business,\nand I don't know business. It is he who encourages me. He emerges\nfrom great feats of business, presents the brightest prospects before\nme as their result, and calls upon me to admire them. I do admire\nthem--as bright prospects. But I know no more about them, and I tell\nhim so.\"\n\nThe helpless kind of candour with which he presented this before us,\nthe light-hearted manner in which he was amused by his innocence, the\nfantastic way in which he took himself under his own protection and\nargued about that curious person, combined with the delightful ease\nof everything he said exactly to make out my guardian's case. The\nmore I saw of him, the more unlikely it seemed to me, when he was\npresent, that he could design, conceal, or influence anything; and\nyet the less likely that appeared when he was not present, and the\nless agreeable it was to think of his having anything to do with any\none for whom I cared.\n\nHearing that his examination (as he called it) was now over, Mr.\nSkimpole left the room with a radiant face to fetch his daughters\n(his sons had run away at various times), leaving my guardian quite\ndelighted by the manner in which he had vindicated his childish\ncharacter. He soon came back, bringing with him the three young\nladies and Mrs. Skimpole, who had once been a beauty but was now a\ndelicate high-nosed invalid suffering under a complication of\ndisorders.\n\n\"This,\" said Mr. Skimpole, \"is my Beauty daughter, Arethusa--plays\nand sings odds and ends like her father. This is my Sentiment\ndaughter, Laura--plays a little but don't sing. This is my Comedy\ndaughter, Kitty--sings a little but don't play. We all draw a little\nand compose a little, and none of us have any idea of time or money.\"\n\nMrs. Skimpole sighed, I thought, as if she would have been glad to\nstrike out this item in the family attainments. I also thought that\nshe rather impressed her sigh upon my guardian and that she took\nevery opportunity of throwing in another.\n\n\"It is pleasant,\" said Mr. Skimpole, turning his sprightly eyes from\none to the other of us, \"and it is whimsically interesting to trace\npeculiarities in families. In this family we are all children, and I\nam the youngest.\"\n\nThe daughters, who appeared to be very fond of him, were amused by\nthis droll fact, particularly the Comedy daughter.\n\n\"My dears, it is true,\" said Mr. Skimpole, \"is it not? So it is, and\nso it must be, because like the dogs in the hymn, 'it is our nature\nto.' Now, here is Miss Summerson with a fine administrative capacity\nand a knowledge of details perfectly surprising. It will sound very\nstrange in Miss Summerson's ears, I dare say, that we know nothing\nabout chops in this house. But we don't, not the least. We can't cook\nanything whatever. A needle and thread we don't know how to use. We\nadmire the people who possess the practical wisdom we want, but we\ndon't quarrel with them. Then why should they quarrel with us? Live\nand let live, we say to them. Live upon your practical wisdom, and\nlet us live upon you!\"\n\nHe laughed, but as usual seemed quite candid and really to mean what\nhe said.\n\n\"We have sympathy, my roses,\" said Mr. Skimpole, \"sympathy for\neverything. Have we not?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, papa!\" cried the three daughters.\n\n\"In fact, that is our family department,\" said Mr. Skimpole, \"in this\nhurly-burly of life. We are capable of looking on and of being\ninterested, and we DO look on, and we ARE interested. What more can\nwe do? Here is my Beauty daughter, married these three years. Now I\ndare say her marrying another child, and having two more, was all\nwrong in point of political economy, but it was very agreeable. We\nhad our little festivities on those occasions and exchanged social\nideas. She brought her young husband home one day, and they and their\nyoung fledglings have their nest upstairs. I dare say at some time or\nother Sentiment and Comedy will bring THEIR husbands home and have\nTHEIR nests upstairs too. So we get on, we don't know how, but\nsomehow.\"\n\nShe looked very young indeed to be the mother of two children, and I\ncould not help pitying both her and them. It was evident that the\nthree daughters had grown up as they could and had had just as little\nhaphazard instruction as qualified them to be their father's\nplaythings in his idlest hours. His pictorial tastes were consulted,\nI observed, in their respective styles of wearing their hair, the\nBeauty daughter being in the classic manner, the Sentiment daughter\nluxuriant and flowing, and the Comedy daughter in the arch style,\nwith a good deal of sprightly forehead, and vivacious little curls\ndotted about the corners of her eyes. They were dressed to\ncorrespond, though in a most untidy and negligent way.\n\nAda and I conversed with these young ladies and found them\nwonderfully like their father. In the meanwhile Mr. Jarndyce (who had\nbeen rubbing his head to a great extent, and hinted at a change in\nthe wind) talked with Mrs. Skimpole in a corner, where we could not\nhelp hearing the chink of money. Mr. Skimpole had previously\nvolunteered to go home with us and had withdrawn to dress himself for\nthe purpose.\n\n\"My roses,\" he said when he came back, \"take care of mama. She is\npoorly to-day. By going home with Mr. Jarndyce for a day or two, I\nshall hear the larks sing and preserve my amiability. It has been\ntried, you know, and would be tried again if I remained at home.\"\n\n\"That bad man!\" said the Comedy daughter.\n\n\"At the very time when he knew papa was lying ill by his wallflowers,\nlooking at the blue sky,\" Laura complained.\n\n\"And when the smell of hay was in the air!\" said Arethusa.\n\n\"It showed a want of poetry in the man,\" Mr. Skimpole assented, but\nwith perfect good humour. \"It was coarse. There was an absence of the\nfiner touches of humanity in it! My daughters have taken great\noffence,\" he explained to us, \"at an honest man--\"\n\n\"Not honest, papa. Impossible!\" they all three protested.\n\n\"At a rough kind of fellow--a sort of human hedgehog rolled up,\" said\nMr. Skimpole, \"who is a baker in this neighbourhood and from whom we\nborrowed a couple of arm-chairs. We wanted a couple of arm-chairs,\nand we hadn't got them, and therefore of course we looked to a man\nwho HAD got them, to lend them. Well! This morose person lent them,\nand we wore them out. When they were worn out, he wanted them back.\nHe had them back. He was contented, you will say. Not at all. He\nobjected to their being worn. I reasoned with him, and pointed out\nhis mistake. I said, 'Can you, at your time of life, be so\nheadstrong, my friend, as to persist that an arm-chair is a thing to\nput upon a shelf and look at? That it is an object to contemplate, to\nsurvey from a distance, to consider from a point of sight? Don't you\nKNOW that these arm-chairs were borrowed to be sat upon?' He was\nunreasonable and unpersuadable and used intemperate language. Being\nas patient as I am at this minute, I addressed another appeal to him.\nI said, 'Now, my good man, however our business capacities may vary,\nwe are all children of one great mother, Nature. On this blooming\nsummer morning here you see me' (I was on the sofa) 'with flowers\nbefore me, fruit upon the table, the cloudless sky above me, the air\nfull of fragrance, contemplating Nature. I entreat you, by our common\nbrotherhood, not to interpose between me and a subject so sublime,\nthe absurd figure of an angry baker!' But he did,\" said Mr. Skimpole,\nraising his laughing eyes in playful astonishment; \"he did interpose\nthat ridiculous figure, and he does, and he will again. And therefore\nI am very glad to get out of his way and to go home with my friend\nJarndyce.\"\n\nIt seemed to escape his consideration that Mrs. Skimpole and the\ndaughters remained behind to encounter the baker, but this was so old\na story to all of them that it had become a matter of course. He took\nleave of his family with a tenderness as airy and graceful as any\nother aspect in which he showed himself and rode away with us in\nperfect harmony of mind. We had an opportunity of seeing through some\nopen doors, as we went downstairs, that his own apartment was a\npalace to the rest of the house.\n\nI could have no anticipation, and I had none, that something very\nstartling to me at the moment, and ever memorable to me in what\nensued from it, was to happen before this day was out. Our guest was\nin such spirits on the way home that I could do nothing but listen to\nhim and wonder at him; nor was I alone in this, for Ada yielded to\nthe same fascination. As to my guardian, the wind, which had\nthreatened to become fixed in the east when we left Somers Town,\nveered completely round before we were a couple of miles from it.\n\nWhether of questionable childishness or not in any other matters, Mr.\nSkimpole had a child's enjoyment of change and bright weather. In no\nway wearied by his sallies on the road, he was in the drawing-room\nbefore any of us; and I heard him at the piano while I was yet\nlooking after my housekeeping, singing refrains of barcaroles and\ndrinking songs, Italian and German, by the score.\n\nWe were all assembled shortly before dinner, and he was still at the\npiano idly picking out in his luxurious way little strains of music,\nand talking between whiles of finishing some sketches of the ruined\nold Verulam wall to-morrow, which he had begun a year or two ago and\nhad got tired of, when a card was brought in and my guardian read\naloud in a surprised voice, \"Sir Leicester Dedlock!\"\n\nThe visitor was in the room while it was yet turning round with me\nand before I had the power to stir. If I had had it, I should have\nhurried away. I had not even the presence of mind, in my giddiness,\nto retire to Ada in the window, or to see the window, or to know\nwhere it was. I heard my name and found that my guardian was\npresenting me before I could move to a chair.\n\n\"Pray be seated, Sir Leicester.\"\n\n\"Mr. Jarndyce,\" said Sir Leicester in reply as he bowed and seated\nhimself, \"I do myself the honour of calling here--\"\n\n\"You do ME the honour, Sir Leicester.\"\n\n\"Thank you--of calling here on my road from Lincolnshire to express\nmy regret that any cause of complaint, however strong, that I may\nhave against a gentleman who--who is known to you and has been your\nhost, and to whom therefore I will make no farther reference, should\nhave prevented you, still more ladies under your escort and charge,\nfrom seeing whatever little there may be to gratify a polite and\nrefined taste at my house, Chesney Wold.\"\n\n\"You are exceedingly obliging, Sir Leicester, and on behalf of those\nladies (who are present) and for myself, I thank you very much.\"\n\n\"It is possible, Mr. Jarndyce, that the gentleman to whom, for the\nreasons I have mentioned, I refrain from making further allusion--it\nis possible, Mr. Jarndyce, that that gentleman may have done me the\nhonour so far to misapprehend my character as to induce you to\nbelieve that you would not have been received by my local\nestablishment in Lincolnshire with that urbanity, that courtesy,\nwhich its members are instructed to show to all ladies and gentlemen\nwho present themselves at that house. I merely beg to observe, sir,\nthat the fact is the reverse.\"\n\nMy guardian delicately dismissed this remark without making any\nverbal answer.\n\n\"It has given me pain, Mr. Jarndyce,\" Sir Leicester weightily\nproceeded. \"I assure you, sir, it has given--me--pain--to learn from\nthe housekeeper at Chesney Wold that a gentleman who was in your\ncompany in that part of the county, and who would appear to possess a\ncultivated taste for the fine arts, was likewise deterred by some\nsuch cause from examining the family pictures with that leisure, that\nattention, that care, which he might have desired to bestow upon them\nand which some of them might possibly have repaid.\" Here he produced\na card and read, with much gravity and a little trouble, through his\neye-glass, \"Mr. Hirrold--Herald--Harold--Skampling--Skumpling--I beg\nyour pardon--Skimpole.\"\n\n\"This is Mr. Harold Skimpole,\" said my guardian, evidently surprised.\n\n\"Oh!\" exclaimed Sir Leicester, \"I am happy to meet Mr. Skimpole and\nto have the opportunity of tendering my personal regrets. I hope,\nsir, that when you again find yourself in my part of the county, you\nwill be under no similar sense of restraint.\"\n\n\"You are very obliging, Sir Leicester Dedlock. So encouraged, I shall\ncertainly give myself the pleasure and advantage of another visit to\nyour beautiful house. The owners of such places as Chesney Wold,\"\nsaid Mr. Skimpole with his usual happy and easy air, \"are public\nbenefactors. They are good enough to maintain a number of delightful\nobjects for the admiration and pleasure of us poor men; and not to\nreap all the admiration and pleasure that they yield is to be\nungrateful to our benefactors.\"\n\nSir Leicester seemed to approve of this sentiment highly. \"An artist,\nsir?\"\n\n\"No,\" returned Mr. Skimpole. \"A perfectly idle man. A mere amateur.\"\n\nSir Leicester seemed to approve of this even more. He hoped he might\nhave the good fortune to be at Chesney Wold when Mr. Skimpole next\ncame down into Lincolnshire. Mr. Skimpole professed himself much\nflattered and honoured.\n\n\"Mr. Skimpole mentioned,\" pursued Sir Leicester, addressing himself\nagain to my guardian, \"mentioned to the housekeeper, who, as he may\nhave observed, is an old and attached retainer of the family--\"\n\n(\"That is, when I walked through the house the other day, on the\noccasion of my going down to visit Miss Summerson and Miss Clare,\"\nMr. Skimpole airily explained to us.)\n\n\"--That the friend with whom he had formerly been staying there was\nMr. Jarndyce.\" Sir Leicester bowed to the bearer of that name. \"And\nhence I became aware of the circumstance for which I have professed\nmy regret. That this should have occurred to any gentleman, Mr.\nJarndyce, but especially a gentleman formerly known to Lady Dedlock,\nand indeed claiming some distant connexion with her, and for whom (as\nI learn from my Lady herself) she entertains a high respect, does, I\nassure you, give--me--pain.\"\n\n\"Pray say no more about it, Sir Leicester,\" returned my guardian. \"I\nam very sensible, as I am sure we all are, of your consideration.\nIndeed the mistake was mine, and I ought to apologize for it.\"\n\nI had not once looked up. I had not seen the visitor and had not even\nappeared to myself to hear the conversation. It surprises me to find\nthat I can recall it, for it seemed to make no impression on me as it\npassed. I heard them speaking, but my mind was so confused and my\ninstinctive avoidance of this gentleman made his presence so\ndistressing to me that I thought I understood nothing, through the\nrushing in my head and the beating of my heart.\n\n\"I mentioned the subject to Lady Dedlock,\" said Sir Leicester,\nrising, \"and my Lady informed me that she had had the pleasure of\nexchanging a few words with Mr. Jarndyce and his wards on the\noccasion of an accidental meeting during their sojourn in the\nvicinity. Permit me, Mr. Jarndyce, to repeat to yourself, and to\nthese ladies, the assurance I have already tendered to Mr. Skimpole.\nCircumstances undoubtedly prevent my saying that it would afford me\nany gratification to hear that Mr. Boythorn had favoured my house\nwith his presence, but those circumstances are confined to that\ngentleman himself and do not extend beyond him.\"\n\n\"You know my old opinion of him,\" said Mr. Skimpole, lightly\nappealing to us. \"An amiable bull who is determined to make every\ncolour scarlet!\"\n\nSir Leicester Dedlock coughed as if he could not possibly hear\nanother word in reference to such an individual and took his leave\nwith great ceremony and politeness. I got to my own room with all\npossible speed and remained there until I had recovered my\nself-command. It had been very much disturbed, but I was thankful to\nfind when I went downstairs again that they only rallied me for\nhaving been shy and mute before the great Lincolnshire baronet.\n\nBy that time I had made up my mind that the period was come when I\nmust tell my guardian what I knew. The possibility of my being\nbrought into contact with my mother, of my being taken to her house,\neven of Mr. Skimpole's, however distantly associated with me,\nreceiving kindnesses and obligations from her husband, was so painful\nthat I felt I could no longer guide myself without his assistance.\n\nWhen we had retired for the night, and Ada and I had had our usual\ntalk in our pretty room, I went out at my door again and sought my\nguardian among his books. I knew he always read at that hour, and as\nI drew near I saw the light shining out into the passage from his\nreading-lamp.\n\n\"May I come in, guardian?\"\n\n\"Surely, little woman. What's the matter?\"\n\n\"Nothing is the matter. I thought I would like to take this quiet\ntime of saying a word to you about myself.\"\n\nHe put a chair for me, shut his book, and put it by, and turned his\nkind attentive face towards me. I could not help observing that it\nwore that curious expression I had observed in it once before--on\nthat night when he had said that he was in no trouble which I could\nreadily understand.\n\n\"What concerns you, my dear Esther,\" said he, \"concerns us all. You\ncannot be more ready to speak than I am to hear.\"\n\n\"I know that, guardian. But I have such need of your advice and\nsupport. Oh! You don't know how much need I have to-night.\"\n\nHe looked unprepared for my being so earnest, and even a little\nalarmed.\n\n\"Or how anxious I have been to speak to you,\" said I, \"ever since the\nvisitor was here to-day.\"\n\n\"The visitor, my dear! Sir Leicester Dedlock?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nHe folded his arms and sat looking at me with an air of the\nprofoundest astonishment, awaiting what I should say next. I did not\nknow how to prepare him.\n\n\"Why, Esther,\" said he, breaking into a smile, \"our visitor and you\nare the two last persons on earth I should have thought of connecting\ntogether!\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, guardian, I know it. And I too, but a little while ago.\"\n\nThe smile passed from his face, and he became graver than before. He\ncrossed to the door to see that it was shut (but I had seen to that)\nand resumed his seat before me.\n\n\"Guardian,\" said I, \"do you remember, when we were overtaken by the\nthunder-storm, Lady Dedlock's speaking to you of her sister?\"\n\n\"Of course. Of course I do.\"\n\n\"And reminding you that she and her sister had differed, had gone\ntheir several ways?\"\n\n\"Of course.\"\n\n\"Why did they separate, guardian?\"\n\nHis face quite altered as he looked at me. \"My child, what questions\nare these! I never knew. No one but themselves ever did know, I\nbelieve. Who could tell what the secrets of those two handsome and\nproud women were! You have seen Lady Dedlock. If you had ever seen\nher sister, you would know her to have been as resolute and haughty\nas she.\"\n\n\"Oh, guardian, I have seen her many and many a time!\"\n\n\"Seen her?\"\n\nHe paused a little, biting his lip. \"Then, Esther, when you spoke to\nme long ago of Boythorn, and when I told you that he was all but\nmarried once, and that the lady did not die, but died to him, and\nthat that time had had its influence on his later life--did you know\nit all, and know who the lady was?\"\n\n\"No, guardian,\" I returned, fearful of the light that dimly broke\nupon me. \"Nor do I know yet.\"\n\n\"Lady Dedlock's sister.\"\n\n\"And why,\" I could scarcely ask him, \"why, guardian, pray tell me why\nwere THEY parted?\"\n\n\"It was her act, and she kept its motives in her inflexible heart. He\nafterwards did conjecture (but it was mere conjecture) that some\ninjury which her haughty spirit had received in her cause of quarrel\nwith her sister had wounded her beyond all reason, but she wrote him\nthat from the date of that letter she died to him--as in literal\ntruth she did--and that the resolution was exacted from her by her\nknowledge of his proud temper and his strained sense of honour, which\nwere both her nature too. In consideration for those master points in\nhim, and even in consideration for them in herself, she made the\nsacrifice, she said, and would live in it and die in it. She did\nboth, I fear; certainly he never saw her, never heard of her from\nthat hour. Nor did any one.\"\n\n\"Oh, guardian, what have I done!\" I cried, giving way to my grief;\n\"what sorrow have I innocently caused!\"\n\n\"You caused, Esther?\"\n\n\"Yes, guardian. Innocently, but most surely. That secluded sister is\nmy first remembrance.\"\n\n\"No, no!\" he cried, starting.\n\n\"Yes, guardian, yes! And HER sister is my mother!\"\n\nI would have told him all my mother's letter, but he would not hear\nit then. He spoke so tenderly and wisely to me, and he put so plainly\nbefore me all I had myself imperfectly thought and hoped in my better\nstate of mind, that, penetrated as I had been with fervent gratitude\ntowards him through so many years, I believed I had never loved him\nso dearly, never thanked him in my heart so fully, as I did that\nnight. And when he had taken me to my room and kissed me at the door,\nand when at last I lay down to sleep, my thought was how could I ever\nbe busy enough, how could I ever be good enough, how in my little way\ncould I ever hope to be forgetful enough of myself, devoted enough to\nhim, and useful enough to others, to show him how I blessed and\nhonoured him.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLIV\n\nThe Letter and the Answer\n\n\nMy guardian called me into his room next morning, and then I told him\nwhat had been left untold on the previous night. There was nothing to\nbe done, he said, but to keep the secret and to avoid another such\nencounter as that of yesterday. He understood my feeling and entirely\nshared it. He charged himself even with restraining Mr. Skimpole from\nimproving his opportunity. One person whom he need not name to me, it\nwas not now possible for him to advise or help. He wished it were,\nbut no such thing could be. If her mistrust of the lawyer whom she\nhad mentioned were well-founded, which he scarcely doubted, he\ndreaded discovery. He knew something of him, both by sight and by\nreputation, and it was certain that he was a dangerous man. Whatever\nhappened, he repeatedly impressed upon me with anxious affection and\nkindness, I was as innocent of as himself and as unable to influence.\n\n\"Nor do I understand,\" said he, \"that any doubts tend towards you, my\ndear. Much suspicion may exist without that connexion.\"\n\n\"With the lawyer,\" I returned. \"But two other persons have come into\nmy mind since I have been anxious. Then I told him all about Mr.\nGuppy, who I feared might have had his vague surmises when I little\nunderstood his meaning, but in whose silence after our last interview\nI expressed perfect confidence.\n\n\"Well,\" said my guardian. \"Then we may dismiss him for the present.\nWho is the other?\"\n\nI called to his recollection the French maid and the eager offer of\nherself she had made to me.\n\n\"Ha!\" he returned thoughtfully. \"That is a more alarming person than\nthe clerk. But after all, my dear, it was but seeking for a new\nservice. She had seen you and Ada a little while before, and it was\nnatural that you should come into her head. She merely proposed\nherself for your maid, you know. She did nothing more.\"\n\n\"Her manner was strange,\" said I.\n\n\"Yes, and her manner was strange when she took her shoes off and\nshowed that cool relish for a walk that might have ended in her\ndeath-bed,\" said my guardian. \"It would be useless self-distress and\ntorment to reckon up such chances and possibilities. There are very\nfew harmless circumstances that would not seem full of perilous\nmeaning, so considered. Be hopeful, little woman. You can be nothing\nbetter than yourself; be that, through this knowledge, as you were\nbefore you had it. It is the best you can do for everybody's sake. I,\nsharing the secret with you--\"\n\n\"And lightening it, guardian, so much,\" said I.\n\n\"--will be attentive to what passes in that family, so far as I can\nobserve it from my distance. And if the time should come when I can\nstretch out a hand to render the least service to one whom it is\nbetter not to name even here, I will not fail to do it for her dear\ndaughter's sake.\"\n\nI thanked him with my whole heart. What could I ever do but thank\nhim! I was going out at the door when he asked me to stay a moment.\nQuickly turning round, I saw that same expression on his face again;\nand all at once, I don't know how, it flashed upon me as a new and\nfar-off possibility that I understood it.\n\n\"My dear Esther,\" said my guardian, \"I have long had something in my\nthoughts that I have wished to say to you.\"\n\n\"Indeed?\"\n\n\"I have had some difficulty in approaching it, and I still have. I\nshould wish it to be so deliberately said, and so deliberately\nconsidered. Would you object to my writing it?\"\n\n\"Dear guardian, how could I object to your writing anything for ME to\nread?\"\n\n\"Then see, my love,\" said he with his cheery smile, \"am I at this\nmoment quite as plain and easy--do I seem as open, as honest and\nold-fashioned--as I am at any time?\"\n\nI answered in all earnestness, \"Quite.\" With the strictest truth, for\nhis momentary hesitation was gone (it had not lasted a minute), and\nhis fine, sensible, cordial, sterling manner was restored.\n\n\"Do I look as if I suppressed anything, meant anything but what I\nsaid, had any reservation at all, no matter what?\" said he with his\nbright clear eyes on mine.\n\nI answered, most assuredly he did not.\n\n\"Can you fully trust me, and thoroughly rely on what I profess,\nEsther?\"\n\n\"Most thoroughly,\" said I with my whole heart.\n\n\"My dear girl,\" returned my guardian, \"give me your hand.\"\n\nHe took it in his, holding me lightly with his arm, and looking down\ninto my face with the same genuine freshness and faithfulness of\nmanner--the old protecting manner which had made that house my home\nin a moment--said, \"You have wrought changes in me, little woman,\nsince the winter day in the stage-coach. First and last you have done\nme a world of good since that time.\"\n\n\"Ah, guardian, what have you done for me since that time!\"\n\n\"But,\" said he, \"that is not to be remembered now.\"\n\n\"It never can be forgotten.\"\n\n\"Yes, Esther,\" said he with a gentle seriousness, \"it is to be\nforgotten now, to be forgotten for a while. You are only to remember\nnow that nothing can change me as you know me. Can you feel quite\nassured of that, my dear?\"\n\n\"I can, and I do,\" I said.\n\n\"That's much,\" he answered. \"That's everything. But I must not take\nthat at a word. I will not write this something in my thoughts until\nyou have quite resolved within yourself that nothing can change me as\nyou know me. If you doubt that in the least degree, I will never\nwrite it. If you are sure of that, on good consideration, send\nCharley to me this night week--'for the letter.' But if you are not\nquite certain, never send. Mind, I trust to your truth, in this thing\nas in everything. If you are not quite certain on that one point,\nnever send!\"\n\n\"Guardian,\" said I, \"I am already certain, I can no more be changed\nin that conviction than you can be changed towards me. I shall send\nCharley for the letter.\"\n\nHe shook my hand and said no more. Nor was any more said in reference\nto this conversation, either by him or me, through the whole week.\nWhen the appointed night came, I said to Charley as soon as I was\nalone, \"Go and knock at Mr. Jarndyce's door, Charley, and say you\nhave come from me--'for the letter.'\" Charley went up the stairs, and\ndown the stairs, and along the passages--the zig-zag way about the\nold-fashioned house seemed very long in my listening ears that\nnight--and so came back, along the passages, and down the stairs, and\nup the stairs, and brought the letter. \"Lay it on the table,\nCharley,\" said I. So Charley laid it on the table and went to bed,\nand I sat looking at it without taking it up, thinking of many\nthings.\n\nI began with my overshadowed childhood, and passed through those\ntimid days to the heavy time when my aunt lay dead, with her resolute\nface so cold and set, and when I was more solitary with Mrs. Rachael\nthan if I had had no one in the world to speak to or to look at. I\npassed to the altered days when I was so blest as to find friends in\nall around me, and to be beloved. I came to the time when I first saw\nmy dear girl and was received into that sisterly affection which was\nthe grace and beauty of my life. I recalled the first bright gleam of\nwelcome which had shone out of those very windows upon our expectant\nfaces on that cold bright night, and which had never paled. I lived\nmy happy life there over again, I went through my illness and\nrecovery, I thought of myself so altered and of those around me so\nunchanged; and all this happiness shone like a light from one central\nfigure, represented before me by the letter on the table.\n\nI opened it and read it. It was so impressive in its love for me, and\nin the unselfish caution it gave me, and the consideration it showed\nfor me in every word, that my eyes were too often blinded to read\nmuch at a time. But I read it through three times before I laid it\ndown. I had thought beforehand that I knew its purport, and I did. It\nasked me, would I be the mistress of Bleak House.\n\nIt was not a love letter, though it expressed so much love, but was\nwritten just as he would at any time have spoken to me. I saw his\nface, and heard his voice, and felt the influence of his kind\nprotecting manner in every line. It addressed me as if our places\nwere reversed, as if all the good deeds had been mine and all the\nfeelings they had awakened his. It dwelt on my being young, and he\npast the prime of life; on his having attained a ripe age, while I\nwas a child; on his writing to me with a silvered head, and knowing\nall this so well as to set it in full before me for mature\ndeliberation. It told me that I would gain nothing by such a marriage\nand lose nothing by rejecting it, for no new relation could enhance\nthe tenderness in which he held me, and whatever my decision was, he\nwas certain it would be right. But he had considered this step anew\nsince our late confidence and had decided on taking it, if it only\nserved to show me through one poor instance that the whole world\nwould readily unite to falsify the stern prediction of my childhood.\nI was the last to know what happiness I could bestow upon him, but of\nthat he said no more, for I was always to remember that I owed him\nnothing and that he was my debtor, and for very much. He had often\nthought of our future, and foreseeing that the time must come, and\nfearing that it might come soon, when Ada (now very nearly of age)\nwould leave us, and when our present mode of life must be broken up,\nhad become accustomed to reflect on this proposal. Thus he made it.\nIf I felt that I could ever give him the best right he could have to\nbe my protector, and if I felt that I could happily and justly become\nthe dear companion of his remaining life, superior to all lighter\nchances and changes than death, even then he could not have me bind\nmyself irrevocably while this letter was yet so new to me, but even\nthen I must have ample time for reconsideration. In that case, or in\nthe opposite case, let him be unchanged in his old relation, in his\nold manner, in the old name by which I called him. And as to his\nbright Dame Durden and little housekeeper, she would ever be the\nsame, he knew.\n\nThis was the substance of the letter, written throughout with a\njustice and a dignity as if he were indeed my responsible guardian\nimpartially representing the proposal of a friend against whom in his\nintegrity he stated the full case.\n\nBut he did not hint to me that when I had been better looking he had\nhad this same proceeding in his thoughts and had refrained from it.\nThat when my old face was gone from me, and I had no attractions, he\ncould love me just as well as in my fairer days. That the discovery\nof my birth gave him no shock. That his generosity rose above my\ndisfigurement and my inheritance of shame. That the more I stood in\nneed of such fidelity, the more firmly I might trust in him to the\nlast.\n\nBut I knew it, I knew it well now. It came upon me as the close of\nthe benignant history I had been pursuing, and I felt that I had but\none thing to do. To devote my life to his happiness was to thank him\npoorly, and what had I wished for the other night but some new means\nof thanking him?\n\nStill I cried very much, not only in the fullness of my heart after\nreading the letter, not only in the strangeness of the prospect--for\nit was strange though I had expected the contents--but as if\nsomething for which there was no name or distinct idea were\nindefinitely lost to me. I was very happy, very thankful, very\nhopeful; but I cried very much.\n\nBy and by I went to my old glass. My eyes were red and swollen, and I\nsaid, \"Oh, Esther, Esther, can that be you!\" I am afraid the face in\nthe glass was going to cry again at this reproach, but I held up my\nfinger at it, and it stopped.\n\n\"That is more like the composed look you comforted me with, my dear,\nwhen you showed me such a change!\" said I, beginning to let down my\nhair. \"When you are mistress of Bleak House, you are to be as\ncheerful as a bird. In fact, you are always to be cheerful; so let us\nbegin for once and for all.\"\n\nI went on with my hair now, quite comfortably. I sobbed a little\nstill, but that was because I had been crying, not because I was\ncrying then.\n\n\"And so Esther, my dear, you are happy for life. Happy with your best\nfriends, happy in your old home, happy in the power of doing a great\ndeal of good, and happy in the undeserved love of the best of men.\"\n\nI thought, all at once, if my guardian had married some one else, how\nshould I have felt, and what should I have done! That would have been\na change indeed. It presented my life in such a new and blank form\nthat I rang my housekeeping keys and gave them a kiss before I laid\nthem down in their basket again.\n\nThen I went on to think, as I dressed my hair before the glass, how\noften had I considered within myself that the deep traces of my\nillness and the circumstances of my birth were only new reasons why I\nshould be busy, busy, busy--useful, amiable, serviceable, in all\nhonest, unpretending ways. This was a good time, to be sure, to sit\ndown morbidly and cry! As to its seeming at all strange to me at\nfirst (if that were any excuse for crying, which it was not) that I\nwas one day to be the mistress of Bleak House, why should it seem\nstrange? Other people had thought of such things, if I had not.\n\"Don't you remember, my plain dear,\" I asked myself, looking at the\nglass, \"what Mrs. Woodcourt said before those scars were there about\nyour marrying--\"\n\nPerhaps the name brought them to my remembrance. The dried remains of\nthe flowers. It would be better not to keep them now. They had only\nbeen preserved in memory of something wholly past and gone, but it\nwould be better not to keep them now.\n\nThey were in a book, and it happened to be in the next room--our\nsitting-room, dividing Ada's chamber from mine. I took a candle and\nwent softly in to fetch it from its shelf. After I had it in my hand,\nI saw my beautiful darling, through the open door, lying asleep, and\nI stole in to kiss her.\n\nIt was weak in me, I know, and I could have no reason for crying; but\nI dropped a tear upon her dear face, and another, and another. Weaker\nthan that, I took the withered flowers out and put them for a moment\nto her lips. I thought about her love for Richard, though, indeed,\nthe flowers had nothing to do with that. Then I took them into my own\nroom and burned them at the candle, and they were dust in an instant.\n\nOn entering the breakfast-room next morning, I found my guardian just\nas usual, quite as frank, as open, and free. There being not the\nleast constraint in his manner, there was none (or I think there was\nnone) in mine. I was with him several times in the course of the\nmorning, in and out, when there was no one there, and I thought it\nnot unlikely that he might speak to me about the letter, but he did\nnot say a word.\n\nSo, on the next morning, and the next, and for at least a week, over\nwhich time Mr. Skimpole prolonged his stay. I expected, every day,\nthat my guardian might speak to me about the letter, but he never\ndid.\n\nI thought then, growing uneasy, that I ought to write an answer. I\ntried over and over again in my own room at night, but I could not\nwrite an answer that at all began like a good answer, so I thought\neach night I would wait one more day. And I waited seven more days,\nand he never said a word.\n\nAt last, Mr. Skimpole having departed, we three were one afternoon\ngoing out for a ride; and I, being dressed before Ada and going down,\ncame upon my guardian, with his back towards me, standing at the\ndrawing-room window looking out.\n\nHe turned on my coming in and said, smiling, \"Aye, it's you, little\nwoman, is it?\" and looked out again.\n\nI had made up my mind to speak to him now. In short, I had come down\non purpose. \"Guardian,\" I said, rather hesitating and trembling,\n\"when would you like to have the answer to the letter Charley came\nfor?\"\n\n\"When it's ready, my dear,\" he replied.\n\n\"I think it is ready,\" said I.\n\n\"Is Charley to bring it?\" he asked pleasantly.\n\n\"No. I have brought it myself, guardian,\" I returned.\n\nI put my two arms round his neck and kissed him, and he said was this\nthe mistress of Bleak House, and I said yes; and it made no\ndifference presently, and we all went out together, and I said\nnothing to my precious pet about it.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLV\n\nIn Trust\n\n\nOne morning when I had done jingling about with my baskets of keys,\nas my beauty and I were walking round and round the garden I happened\nto turn my eyes towards the house and saw a long thin shadow going in\nwhich looked like Mr. Vholes. Ada had been telling me only that\nmorning of her hopes that Richard might exhaust his ardour in the\nChancery suit by being so very earnest in it; and therefore, not to\ndamp my dear girl's spirits, I said nothing about Mr. Vholes's\nshadow.\n\nPresently came Charley, lightly winding among the bushes and tripping\nalong the paths, as rosy and pretty as one of Flora's attendants\ninstead of my maid, saying, \"Oh, if you please, miss, would you step\nand speak to Mr. Jarndyce!\"\n\nIt was one of Charley's peculiarities that whenever she was charged\nwith a message she always began to deliver it as soon as she beheld,\nat any distance, the person for whom it was intended. Therefore I saw\nCharley asking me in her usual form of words to \"step and speak\" to\nMr. Jarndyce long before I heard her. And when I did hear her, she\nhad said it so often that she was out of breath.\n\nI told Ada I would make haste back and inquired of Charley as we went\nin whether there was not a gentleman with Mr. Jarndyce. To which\nCharley, whose grammar, I confess to my shame, never did any credit\nto my educational powers, replied, \"Yes, miss. Him as come down in\nthe country with Mr. Richard.\"\n\nA more complete contrast than my guardian and Mr. Vholes I suppose\nthere could not be. I found them looking at one another across a\ntable, the one so open and the other so close, the one so broad and\nupright and the other so narrow and stooping, the one giving out what\nhe had to say in such a rich ringing voice and the other keeping it\nin in such a cold-blooded, gasping, fish-like manner that I thought I\nnever had seen two people so unmatched.\n\n\"You know Mr. Vholes, my dear,\" said my guardian. Not with the\ngreatest urbanity, I must say.\n\nMr. Vholes rose, gloved and buttoned up as usual, and seated himself\nagain, just as he had seated himself beside Richard in the gig. Not\nhaving Richard to look at, he looked straight before him.\n\n\"Mr. Vholes,\" said my guardian, eyeing his black figure as if he were\na bird of ill omen, \"has brought an ugly report of our most\nunfortunate Rick.\" Laying a marked emphasis on \"most unfortunate\" as\nif the words were rather descriptive of his connexion with Mr.\nVholes.\n\nI sat down between them; Mr. Vholes remained immovable, except that\nhe secretly picked at one of the red pimples on his yellow face with\nhis black glove.\n\n\"And as Rick and you are happily good friends, I should like to\nknow,\" said my guardian, \"what you think, my dear. Would you be so\ngood as to--as to speak up, Mr. Vholes?\"\n\nDoing anything but that, Mr. Vholes observed, \"I have been saying\nthat I have reason to know, Miss Summerson, as Mr. C.'s professional\nadviser, that Mr. C.'s circumstances are at the present moment in an\nembarrassed state. Not so much in point of amount as owing to the\npeculiar and pressing nature of liabilities Mr. C. has incurred and\nthe means he has of liquidating or meeting the same. I have staved\noff many little matters for Mr. C., but there is a limit to staving\noff, and we have reached it. I have made some advances out of pocket\nto accommodate these unpleasantnesses, but I necessarily look to\nbeing repaid, for I do not pretend to be a man of capital, and I have\na father to support in the Vale of Taunton, besides striving to\nrealize some little independence for three dear girls at home. My\napprehension is, Mr. C.'s circumstances being such, lest it should\nend in his obtaining leave to part with his commission, which at all\nevents is desirable to be made known to his connexions.\"\n\nMr. Vholes, who had looked at me while speaking, here emerged into\nthe silence he could hardly be said to have broken, so stifled was\nhis tone, and looked before him again.\n\n\"Imagine the poor fellow without even his present resource,\" said my\nguardian to me. \"Yet what can I do? You know him, Esther. He would\nnever accept of help from me now. To offer it or hint at it would be\nto drive him to an extremity, if nothing else did.\"\n\nMr. Vholes hereupon addressed me again.\n\n\"What Mr. Jarndyce remarks, miss, is no doubt the case, and is the\ndifficulty. I do not see that anything is to be done. I do not say\nthat anything is to be done. Far from it. I merely come down here\nunder the seal of confidence and mention it in order that everything\nmay be openly carried on and that it may not be said afterwards that\neverything was not openly carried on. My wish is that everything\nshould be openly carried on. I desire to leave a good name behind me.\nIf I consulted merely my own interests with Mr. C., I should not be\nhere. So insurmountable, as you must well know, would be his\nobjections. This is not a professional attendance. This can he\ncharged to nobody. I have no interest in it except as a member of\nsociety and a father--AND a son,\" said Mr. Vholes, who had nearly\nforgotten that point.\n\nIt appeared to us that Mr. Vholes said neither more nor less than the\ntruth in intimating that he sought to divide the responsibility, such\nas it was, of knowing Richard's situation. I could only suggest that\nI should go down to Deal, where Richard was then stationed, and see\nhim, and try if it were possible to avert the worst. Without\nconsulting Mr. Vholes on this point, I took my guardian aside to\npropose it, while Mr. Vholes gauntly stalked to the fire and warmed\nhis funeral gloves.\n\nThe fatigue of the journey formed an immediate objection on my\nguardian's part, but as I saw he had no other, and as I was only too\nhappy to go, I got his consent. We had then merely to dispose of Mr.\nVholes.\n\n\"Well, sir,\" said Mr. Jarndyce, \"Miss Summerson will communicate with\nMr. Carstone, and you can only hope that his position may be yet\nretrievable. You will allow me to order you lunch after your journey,\nsir.\"\n\n\"I thank you, Mr. Jarndyce,\" said Mr. Vholes, putting out his long\nblack sleeve to check the ringing of the bell, \"not any. I thank you,\nno, not a morsel. My digestion is much impaired, and I am but a poor\nknife and fork at any time. If I was to partake of solid food at this\nperiod of the day, I don't know what the consequences might be.\nEverything having been openly carried on, sir, I will now with your\npermission take my leave.\"\n\n\"And I would that you could take your leave, and we could all take\nour leave, Mr. Vholes,\" returned my guardian bitterly, \"of a cause\nyou know of.\"\n\nMr. Vholes, whose black dye was so deep from head to foot that it had\nquite steamed before the fire, diffusing a very unpleasant perfume,\nmade a short one-sided inclination of his head from the neck and\nslowly shook it.\n\n\"We whose ambition it is to be looked upon in the light of\nrespectable practitioners, sir, can but put our shoulders to the\nwheel. We do it, sir. At least, I do it myself; and I wish to think\nwell of my professional brethren, one and all. You are sensible of an\nobligation not to refer to me, miss, in communicating with Mr. C.?\"\n\nI said I would be careful not to do it.\n\n\"Just so, miss. Good morning. Mr. Jarndyce, good morning, sir.\" Mr.\nVholes put his dead glove, which scarcely seemed to have any hand in\nit, on my fingers, and then on my guardian's fingers, and took his\nlong thin shadow away. I thought of it on the outside of the coach,\npassing over all the sunny landscape between us and London, chilling\nthe seed in the ground as it glided along.\n\nOf course it became necessary to tell Ada where I was going and why I\nwas going, and of course she was anxious and distressed. But she was\ntoo true to Richard to say anything but words of pity and words of\nexcuse, and in a more loving spirit still--my dear devoted girl!--she\nwrote him a long letter, of which I took charge.\n\nCharley was to be my travelling companion, though I am sure I wanted\nnone and would willingly have left her at home. We all went to London\nthat afternoon, and finding two places in the mail, secured them. At\nour usual bed-time, Charley and I were rolling away seaward with the\nKentish letters.\n\nIt was a night's journey in those coach times, but we had the mail to\nourselves and did not find the night very tedious. It passed with me\nas I suppose it would with most people under such circumstances. At\none while my journey looked hopeful, and at another hopeless. Now I\nthought I should do some good, and now I wondered how I could ever\nhave supposed so. Now it seemed one of the most reasonable things in\nthe world that I should have come, and now one of the most\nunreasonable. In what state I should find Richard, what I should say\nto him, and what he would say to me occupied my mind by turns with\nthese two states of feeling; and the wheels seemed to play one tune\n(to which the burden of my guardian's letter set itself) over and\nover again all night.\n\nAt last we came into the narrow streets of Deal, and very gloomy they\nwere upon a raw misty morning. The long flat beach, with its little\nirregular houses, wooden and brick, and its litter of capstans, and\ngreat boats, and sheds, and bare upright poles with tackle and\nblocks, and loose gravelly waste places overgrown with grass and\nweeds, wore as dull an appearance as any place I ever saw. The sea\nwas heaving under a thick white fog; and nothing else was moving but\na few early ropemakers, who, with the yarn twisted round their\nbodies, looked as if, tired of their present state of existence, they\nwere spinning themselves into cordage.\n\nBut when we got into a warm room in an excellent hotel and sat down,\ncomfortably washed and dressed, to an early breakfast (for it was too\nlate to think of going to bed), Deal began to look more cheerful. Our\nlittle room was like a ship's cabin, and that delighted Charley very\nmuch. Then the fog began to rise like a curtain, and numbers of ships\nthat we had had no idea were near appeared. I don't know how many\nsail the waiter told us were then lying in the downs. Some of these\nvessels were of grand size--one was a large Indiaman just come home;\nand when the sun shone through the clouds, making silvery pools in\nthe dark sea, the way in which these ships brightened, and shadowed,\nand changed, amid a bustle of boats pulling off from the shore to\nthem and from them to the shore, and a general life and motion in\nthemselves and everything around them, was most beautiful.\n\nThe large Indiaman was our great attraction because she had come into\nthe downs in the night. She was surrounded by boats, and we said how\nglad the people on board of her must be to come ashore. Charley was\ncurious, too, about the voyage, and about the heat in India, and the\nserpents and the tigers; and as she picked up such information much\nfaster than grammar, I told her what I knew on those points. I told\nher, too, how people in such voyages were sometimes wrecked and cast\non rocks, where they were saved by the intrepidity and humanity of\none man. And Charley asking how that could be, I told her how we knew\nat home of such a case.\n\nI had thought of sending Richard a note saying I was there, but it\nseemed so much better to go to him without preparation. As he lived\nin barracks I was a little doubtful whether this was feasible, but we\nwent out to reconnoitre. Peeping in at the gate of the barrack-yard,\nwe found everything very quiet at that time in the morning, and I\nasked a sergeant standing on the guardhouse-steps where he lived. He\nsent a man before to show me, who went up some bare stairs, and\nknocked with his knuckles at a door, and left us.\n\n\"Now then!\" cried Richard from within. So I left Charley in the\nlittle passage, and going on to the half-open door, said, \"Can I come\nin, Richard? It's only Dame Durden.\"\n\nHe was writing at a table, with a great confusion of clothes, tin\ncases, books, boots, brushes, and portmanteaus strewn all about the\nfloor. He was only half dressed--in plain clothes, I observed, not in\nuniform--and his hair was unbrushed, and he looked as wild as his\nroom. All this I saw after he had heartily welcomed me and I was\nseated near him, for he started upon hearing my voice and caught me\nin his arms in a moment. Dear Richard! He was ever the same to me.\nDown to--ah, poor poor fellow!--to the end, he never received me but\nwith something of his old merry boyish manner.\n\n\"Good heaven, my dear little woman,\" said he, \"how do you come here?\nWho could have thought of seeing you! Nothing the matter? Ada is\nwell?\"\n\n\"Quite well. Lovelier than ever, Richard!\"\n\n\"Ah!\" he said, leaning back in his chair. \"My poor cousin! I was\nwriting to you, Esther.\"\n\nSo worn and haggard as he looked, even in the fullness of his\nhandsome youth, leaning back in his chair and crushing the closely\nwritten sheet of paper in his hand!\n\n\"Have you been at the trouble of writing all that, and am I not to\nread it after all?\" I asked.\n\n\"Oh, my dear,\" he returned with a hopeless gesture. \"You may read it\nin the whole room. It is all over here.\"\n\nI mildly entreated him not to be despondent. I told him that I had\nheard by chance of his being in difficulty and had come to consult\nwith him what could best be done.\n\n\"Like you, Esther, but useless, and so NOT like you!\" said he with a\nmelancholy smile. \"I am away on leave this day--should have been gone\nin another hour--and that is to smooth it over, for my selling out.\nWell! Let bygones be bygones. So this calling follows the rest. I\nonly want to have been in the church to have made the round of all\nthe professions.\"\n\n\"Richard,\" I urged, \"it is not so hopeless as that?\"\n\n\"Esther,\" he returned, \"it is indeed. I am just so near disgrace as\nthat those who are put in authority over me (as the catechism goes)\nwould far rather be without me than with me. And they are right.\nApart from debts and duns and all such drawbacks, I am not fit even\nfor this employment. I have no care, no mind, no heart, no soul, but\nfor one thing. Why, if this bubble hadn't broken now,\" he said,\ntearing the letter he had written into fragments and moodily casting\nthem away, by driblets, \"how could I have gone abroad? I must have\nbeen ordered abroad, but how could I have gone? How could I, with my\nexperience of that thing, trust even Vholes unless I was at his\nback!\"\n\nI suppose he knew by my face what I was about to say, but he caught\nthe hand I had laid upon his arm and touched my own lips with it to\nprevent me from going on.\n\n\"No, Dame Durden! Two subjects I forbid--must forbid. The first is\nJohn Jarndyce. The second, you know what. Call it madness, and I tell\nyou I can't help it now, and can't be sane. But it is no such thing;\nit is the one object I have to pursue. It is a pity I ever was\nprevailed upon to turn out of my road for any other. It would be\nwisdom to abandon it now, after all the time, anxiety, and pains I\nhave bestowed upon it! Oh, yes, true wisdom. It would be very\nagreeable, too, to some people; but I never will.\"\n\nHe was in that mood in which I thought it best not to increase his\ndetermination (if anything could increase it) by opposing him. I took\nout Ada's letter and put it in his hand.\n\n\"Am I to read it now?\" he asked.\n\nAs I told him yes, he laid it on the table, and resting his head upon\nhis hand, began. He had not read far when he rested his head upon his\ntwo hands--to hide his face from me. In a little while he rose as if\nthe light were bad and went to the window. He finished reading it\nthere, with his back towards me, and after he had finished and had\nfolded it up, stood there for some minutes with the letter in his\nhand. When he came back to his chair, I saw tears in his eyes.\n\n\"Of course, Esther, you know what she says here?\" He spoke in a\nsoftened voice and kissed the letter as he asked me.\n\n\"Yes, Richard.\"\n\n\"Offers me,\" he went on, tapping his foot upon the floor, \"the little\ninheritance she is certain of so soon--just as little and as much as\nI have wasted--and begs and prays me to take it, set myself right\nwith it, and remain in the service.\"\n\n\"I know your welfare to be the dearest wish of her heart,\" said I.\n\"And, oh, my dear Richard, Ada's is a noble heart.\"\n\n\"I am sure it is. I--I wish I was dead!\"\n\nHe went back to the window, and laying his arm across it, leaned his\nhead down on his arm. It greatly affected me to see him so, but I\nhoped he might become more yielding, and I remained silent. My\nexperience was very limited; I was not at all prepared for his\nrousing himself out of this emotion to a new sense of injury.\n\n\"And this is the heart that the same John Jarndyce, who is not\notherwise to be mentioned between us, stepped in to estrange from\nme,\" said he indignantly. \"And the dear girl makes me this generous\noffer from under the same John Jarndyce's roof, and with the same\nJohn Jarndyce's gracious consent and connivance, I dare say, as a new\nmeans of buying me off.\"\n\n\"Richard!\" I cried out, rising hastily. \"I will not hear you say such\nshameful words!\" I was very angry with him indeed, for the first time\nin my life, but it only lasted a moment. When I saw his worn young\nface looking at me as if he were sorry, I put my hand on his shoulder\nand said, \"If you please, my dear Richard, do not speak in such a\ntone to me. Consider!\"\n\nHe blamed himself exceedingly and told me in the most generous manner\nthat he had been very wrong and that he begged my pardon a thousand\ntimes. At that I laughed, but trembled a little too, for I was rather\nfluttered after being so fiery.\n\n\"To accept this offer, my dear Esther,\" said he, sitting down beside\nme and resuming our conversation, \"--once more, pray, pray forgive\nme; I am deeply grieved--to accept my dearest cousin's offer is, I\nneed not say, impossible. Besides, I have letters and papers that I\ncould show you which would convince you it is all over here. I have\ndone with the red coat, believe me. But it is some satisfaction, in\nthe midst of my troubles and perplexities, to know that I am pressing\nAda's interests in pressing my own. Vholes has his shoulder to the\nwheel, and he cannot help urging it on as much for her as for me,\nthank God!\"\n\nHis sanguine hopes were rising within him and lighting up his\nfeatures, but they made his face more sad to me than it had been\nbefore.\n\n\"No, no!\" cried Richard exultingly. \"If every farthing of Ada's\nlittle fortune were mine, no part of it should be spent in retaining\nme in what I am not fit for, can take no interest in, and am weary\nof. It should be devoted to what promises a better return, and should\nbe used where she has a larger stake. Don't be uneasy for me! I shall\nnow have only one thing on my mind, and Vholes and I will work it. I\nshall not be without means. Free of my commission, I shall be able to\ncompound with some small usurers who will hear of nothing but their\nbond now--Vholes says so. I should have a balance in my favour\nanyway, but that would swell it. Come, come! You shall carry a letter\nto Ada from me, Esther, and you must both of you be more hopeful of\nme and not believe that I am quite cast away just yet, my dear.\"\n\nI will not repeat what I said to Richard. I know it was tiresome, and\nnobody is to suppose for a moment that it was at all wise. It only\ncame from my heart. He heard it patiently and feelingly, but I saw\nthat on the two subjects he had reserved it was at present hopeless\nto make any representation to him. I saw too, and had experienced in\nthis very interview, the sense of my guardian's remark that it was\neven more mischievous to use persuasion with him than to leave him as\nhe was.\n\nTherefore I was driven at last to asking Richard if he would mind\nconvincing me that it really was all over there, as he had said, and\nthat it was not his mere impression. He showed me without hesitation\na correspondence making it quite plain that his retirement was\narranged. I found, from what he told me, that Mr. Vholes had copies\nof these papers and had been in consultation with him throughout.\nBeyond ascertaining this, and having been the bearer of Ada's letter,\nand being (as I was going to be) Richard's companion back to London,\nI had done no good by coming down. Admitting this to myself with a\nreluctant heart, I said I would return to the hotel and wait until he\njoined me there, so he threw a cloak over his shoulders and saw me to\nthe gate, and Charley and I went back along the beach.\n\nThere was a concourse of people in one spot, surrounding some naval\nofficers who were landing from a boat, and pressing about them with\nunusual interest. I said to Charley this would be one of the great\nIndiaman's boats now, and we stopped to look.\n\nThe gentlemen came slowly up from the waterside, speaking\ngood-humouredly to each other and to the people around and glancing\nabout them as if they were glad to be in England again. \"Charley,\nCharley,\" said I, \"come away!\" And I hurried on so swiftly that my\nlittle maid was surprised.\n\nIt was not until we were shut up in our cabin-room and I had had time\nto take breath that I began to think why I had made such haste. In\none of the sunburnt faces I had recognized Mr. Allan Woodcourt, and I\nhad been afraid of his recognizing me. I had been unwilling that he\nshould see my altered looks. I had been taken by surprise, and my\ncourage had quite failed me.\n\nBut I knew this would not do, and I now said to myself, \"My dear,\nthere is no reason--there is and there can be no reason at all--why\nit should be worse for you now than it ever has been. What you were\nlast month, you are to-day; you are no worse, you are no better. This\nis not your resolution; call it up, Esther, call it up!\" I was in a\ngreat tremble--with running--and at first was quite unable to calm\nmyself; but I got better, and I was very glad to know it.\n\nThe party came to the hotel. I heard them speaking on the staircase.\nI was sure it was the same gentlemen because I knew their voices\nagain--I mean I knew Mr. Woodcourt's. It would still have been a\ngreat relief to me to have gone away without making myself known, but\nI was determined not to do so. \"No, my dear, no. No, no, no!\"\n\nI untied my bonnet and put my veil half up--I think I mean half down,\nbut it matters very little--and wrote on one of my cards that I\nhappened to be there with Mr. Richard Carstone, and I sent it in to\nMr. Woodcourt. He came immediately. I told him I was rejoiced to be\nby chance among the first to welcome him home to England. And I saw\nthat he was very sorry for me.\n\n\"You have been in shipwreck and peril since you left us, Mr.\nWoodcourt,\" said I, \"but we can hardly call that a misfortune which\nenabled you to be so useful and so brave. We read of it with the\ntruest interest. It first came to my knowledge through your old\npatient, poor Miss Flite, when I was recovering from my severe\nillness.\"\n\n\"Ah! Little Miss Flite!\" he said. \"She lives the same life yet?\"\n\n\"Just the same.\"\n\nI was so comfortable with myself now as not to mind the veil and to\nbe able to put it aside.\n\n\"Her gratitude to you, Mr. Woodcourt, is delightful. She is a most\naffectionate creature, as I have reason to say.\"\n\n\"You--you have found her so?\" he returned. \"I--I am glad of that.\" He\nwas so very sorry for me that he could scarcely speak.\n\n\"I assure you,\" said I, \"that I was deeply touched by her sympathy\nand pleasure at the time I have referred to.\"\n\n\"I was grieved to hear that you had been very ill.\"\n\n\"I was very ill.\"\n\n\"But you have quite recovered?\"\n\n\"I have quite recovered my health and my cheerfulness,\" said I. \"You\nknow how good my guardian is and what a happy life we lead, and I\nhave everything to be thankful for and nothing in the world to\ndesire.\"\n\nI felt as if he had greater commiseration for me than I had ever had\nfor myself. It inspired me with new fortitude and new calmness to\nfind that it was I who was under the necessity of reassuring him. I\nspoke to him of his voyage out and home, and of his future plans, and\nof his probable return to India. He said that was very doubtful. He\nhad not found himself more favoured by fortune there than here. He\nhad gone out a poor ship's surgeon and had come home nothing better.\nWhile we were talking, and when I was glad to believe that I had\nalleviated (if I may use such a term) the shock he had had in seeing\nme, Richard came in. He had heard downstairs who was with me, and\nthey met with cordial pleasure.\n\nI saw that after their first greetings were over, and when they spoke\nof Richard's career, Mr. Woodcourt had a perception that all was not\ngoing well with him. He frequently glanced at his face as if there\nwere something in it that gave him pain, and more than once he looked\ntowards me as though he sought to ascertain whether I knew what the\ntruth was. Yet Richard was in one of his sanguine states and in good\nspirits and was thoroughly pleased to see Mr. Woodcourt again, whom\nhe had always liked.\n\nRichard proposed that we all should go to London together; but Mr.\nWoodcourt, having to remain by his ship a little longer, could not\njoin us. He dined with us, however, at an early hour, and became so\nmuch more like what he used to be that I was still more at peace to\nthink I had been able to soften his regrets. Yet his mind was not\nrelieved of Richard. When the coach was almost ready and Richard ran\ndown to look after his luggage, he spoke to me about him.\n\nI was not sure that I had a right to lay his whole story open, but I\nreferred in a few words to his estrangement from Mr Jarndyce and to\nhis being entangled in the ill-fated Chancery suit. Mr. Woodcourt\nlistened with interest and expressed his regret.\n\n\"I saw you observe him rather closely,\" said I, \"Do you think him so\nchanged?\"\n\n\"He is changed,\" he returned, shaking his head.\n\nI felt the blood rush into my face for the first time, but it was\nonly an instantaneous emotion. I turned my head aside, and it was\ngone.\n\n\"It is not,\" said Mr. Woodcourt, \"his being so much younger or older,\nor thinner or fatter, or paler or ruddier, as there being upon his\nface such a singular expression. I never saw so remarkable a look in\na young person. One cannot say that it is all anxiety or all\nweariness; yet it is both, and like ungrown despair.\"\n\n\"You do not think he is ill?\" said I.\n\nNo. He looked robust in body.\n\n\"That he cannot be at peace in mind, we have too much reason to\nknow,\" I proceeded. \"Mr. Woodcourt, you are going to London?\"\n\n\"To-morrow or the next day.\"\n\n\"There is nothing Richard wants so much as a friend. He always liked\nyou. Pray see him when you get there. Pray help him sometimes with\nyour companionship if you can. You do not know of what service it\nmight be. You cannot think how Ada, and Mr. Jarndyce, and even I--how\nwe should all thank you, Mr. Woodcourt!\"\n\n\"Miss Summerson,\" he said, more moved than he had been from the\nfirst, \"before heaven, I will be a true friend to him! I will accept\nhim as a trust, and it shall be a sacred one!\"\n\n\"God bless you!\" said I, with my eyes filling fast; but I thought\nthey might, when it was not for myself. \"Ada loves him--we all love\nhim, but Ada loves him as we cannot. I will tell her what you say.\nThank you, and God bless you, in her name!\"\n\nRichard came back as we finished exchanging these hurried words and\ngave me his arm to take me to the coach.\n\n\"Woodcourt,\" he said, unconscious with what application, \"pray let us\nmeet in London!\"\n\n\"Meet?\" returned the other. \"I have scarcely a friend there now but\nyou. Where shall I find you?\"\n\n\"Why, I must get a lodging of some sort,\" said Richard, pondering.\n\"Say at Vholes's, Symond's Inn.\"\n\n\"Good! Without loss of time.\"\n\nThey shook hands heartily. When I was seated in the coach and Richard\nwas yet standing in the street, Mr. Woodcourt laid his friendly hand\non Richard's shoulder and looked at me. I understood him and waved\nmine in thanks.\n\nAnd in his last look as we drove away, I saw that he was very sorry\nfor me. I was glad to see it. I felt for my old self as the dead may\nfeel if they ever revisit these scenes. I was glad to be tenderly\nremembered, to be gently pitied, not to be quite forgotten.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLVI\n\nStop Him!\n\n\nDarkness rests upon Tom-All-Alone's. Dilating and dilating since the\nsun went down last night, it has gradually swelled until it fills\nevery void in the place. For a time there were some dungeon lights\nburning, as the lamp of life hums in Tom-all-Alone's, heavily,\nheavily, in the nauseous air, and winking--as that lamp, too, winks\nin Tom-all-Alone's--at many horrible things. But they are blotted\nout. The moon has eyed Tom with a dull cold stare, as admitting some\npuny emulation of herself in his desert region unfit for life and\nblasted by volcanic fires; but she has passed on and is gone. The\nblackest nightmare in the infernal stables grazes on Tom-all-Alone's,\nand Tom is fast asleep.\n\nMuch mighty speech-making there has been, both in and out of\nParliament, concerning Tom, and much wrathful disputation how Tom\nshall be got right. Whether he shall be put into the main road by\nconstables, or by beadles, or by bell-ringing, or by force of\nfigures, or by correct principles of taste, or by high church, or by\nlow church, or by no church; whether he shall be set to splitting\ntrusses of polemical straws with the crooked knife of his mind or\nwhether he shall be put to stone-breaking instead. In the midst of\nwhich dust and noise there is but one thing perfectly clear, to wit,\nthat Tom only may and can, or shall and will, be reclaimed according\nto somebody's theory but nobody's practice. And in the hopeful\nmeantime, Tom goes to perdition head foremost in his old determined\nspirit.\n\nBut he has his revenge. Even the winds are his messengers, and they\nserve him in these hours of darkness. There is not a drop of Tom's\ncorrupted blood but propagates infection and contagion somewhere. It\nshall pollute, this very night, the choice stream (in which chemists\non analysis would find the genuine nobility) of a Norman house, and\nhis Grace shall not be able to say nay to the infamous alliance.\nThere is not an atom of Tom's slime, not a cubic inch of any\npestilential gas in which he lives, not one obscenity or degradation\nabout him, not an ignorance, not a wickedness, not a brutality of his\ncommitting, but shall work its retribution through every order of\nsociety up to the proudest of the proud and to the highest of the\nhigh. Verily, what with tainting, plundering, and spoiling, Tom has\nhis revenge.\n\nIt is a moot point whether Tom-all-Alone's be uglier by day or by\nnight, but on the argument that the more that is seen of it the more\nshocking it must be, and that no part of it left to the imagination\nis at all likely to be made so bad as the reality, day carries it.\nThe day begins to break now; and in truth it might be better for the\nnational glory even that the sun should sometimes set upon the\nBritish dominions than that it should ever rise upon so vile a wonder\nas Tom.\n\nA brown sunburnt gentleman, who appears in some inaptitude for sleep\nto be wandering abroad rather than counting the hours on a restless\npillow, strolls hitherward at this quiet time. Attracted by\ncuriosity, he often pauses and looks about him, up and down the\nmiserable by-ways. Nor is he merely curious, for in his bright dark\neye there is compassionate interest; and as he looks here and there,\nhe seems to understand such wretchedness and to have studied it\nbefore.\n\nOn the banks of the stagnant channel of mud which is the main street\nof Tom-all-Alone's, nothing is to be seen but the crazy houses, shut\nup and silent. No waking creature save himself appears except in one\ndirection, where he sees the solitary figure of a woman sitting on a\ndoor-step. He walks that way. Approaching, he observes that she has\njourneyed a long distance and is footsore and travel-stained. She\nsits on the door-step in the manner of one who is waiting, with her\nelbow on her knee and her head upon her hand. Beside her is a canvas\nbag, or bundle, she has carried. She is dozing probably, for she\ngives no heed to his steps as he comes toward her.\n\nThe broken footway is so narrow that when Allan Woodcourt comes to\nwhere the woman sits, he has to turn into the road to pass her.\nLooking down at her face, his eye meets hers, and he stops.\n\n\"What is the matter?\"\n\n\"Nothing, sir.\"\n\n\"Can't you make them hear? Do you want to be let in?\"\n\n\"I'm waiting till they get up at another house--a lodging-house--not\nhere,\" the woman patiently returns. \"I'm waiting here because there\nwill be sun here presently to warm me.\"\n\n\"I am afraid you are tired. I am sorry to see you sitting in the\nstreet.\"\n\n\"Thank you, sir. It don't matter.\"\n\nA habit in him of speaking to the poor and of avoiding patronage or\ncondescension or childishness (which is the favourite device, many\npeople deeming it quite a subtlety to talk to them like little\nspelling books) has put him on good terms with the woman easily.\n\n\"Let me look at your forehead,\" he says, bending down. \"I am a\ndoctor. Don't be afraid. I wouldn't hurt you for the world.\"\n\nHe knows that by touching her with his skilful and accustomed hand he\ncan soothe her yet more readily. She makes a slight objection,\nsaying, \"It's nothing\"; but he has scarcely laid his fingers on the\nwounded place when she lifts it up to the light.\n\n\"Aye! A bad bruise, and the skin sadly broken. This must be very\nsore.\"\n\n\"It do ache a little, sir,\" returns the woman with a started tear\nupon her cheek.\n\n\"Let me try to make it more comfortable. My handkerchief won't hurt\nyou.\"\n\n\"Oh, dear no, sir, I'm sure of that!\"\n\nHe cleanses the injured place and dries it, and having carefully\nexamined it and gently pressed it with the palm of his hand, takes a\nsmall case from his pocket, dresses it, and binds it up. While he is\nthus employed, he says, after laughing at his establishing a surgery\nin the street, \"And so your husband is a brickmaker?\"\n\n\"How do you know that, sir?\" asks the woman, astonished.\n\n\"Why, I suppose so from the colour of the clay upon your bag and on\nyour dress. And I know brickmakers go about working at piecework in\ndifferent places. And I am sorry to say I have known them cruel to\ntheir wives too.\"\n\nThe woman hastily lifts up her eyes as if she would deny that her\ninjury is referable to such a cause. But feeling the hand upon her\nforehead, and seeing his busy and composed face, she quietly drops\nthem again.\n\n\"Where is he now?\" asks the surgeon.\n\n\"He got into trouble last night, sir; but he'll look for me at the\nlodging-house.\"\n\n\"He will get into worse trouble if he often misuses his large and\nheavy hand as he has misused it here. But you forgive him, brutal as\nhe is, and I say no more of him, except that I wish he deserved it.\nYou have no young child?\"\n\nThe woman shakes her head. \"One as I calls mine, sir, but it's\nLiz's.\"\n\n\"Your own is dead. I see! Poor little thing!\"\n\nBy this time he has finished and is putting up his case. \"I suppose\nyou have some settled home. Is it far from here?\" he asks,\ngood-humouredly making light of what he has done as she gets up and\ncurtsys.\n\n\"It's a good two or three and twenty mile from here, sir. At Saint\nAlbans. You know Saint Albans, sir? I thought you gave a start like,\nas if you did.\"\n\n\"Yes, I know something of it. And now I will ask you a question in\nreturn. Have you money for your lodging?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" she says, \"really and truly.\" And she shows it. He tells\nher, in acknowledgment of her many subdued thanks, that she is very\nwelcome, gives her good day, and walks away. Tom-all-Alone's is still\nasleep, and nothing is astir.\n\nYes, something is! As he retraces his way to the point from which he\ndescried the woman at a distance sitting on the step, he sees a\nragged figure coming very cautiously along, crouching close to the\nsoiled walls--which the wretchedest figure might as well avoid--and\nfurtively thrusting a hand before it. It is the figure of a youth\nwhose face is hollow and whose eyes have an emaciated glare. He is so\nintent on getting along unseen that even the apparition of a stranger\nin whole garments does not tempt him to look back. He shades his face\nwith his ragged elbow as he passes on the other side of the way, and\ngoes shrinking and creeping on with his anxious hand before him and\nhis shapeless clothes hanging in shreds. Clothes made for what\npurpose, or of what material, it would be impossible to say. They\nlook, in colour and in substance, like a bundle of rank leaves of\nswampy growth that rotted long ago.\n\nAllan Woodcourt pauses to look after him and note all this, with a\nshadowy belief that he has seen the boy before. He cannot recall how\nor where, but there is some association in his mind with such a form.\nHe imagines that he must have seen it in some hospital or refuge,\nstill, cannot make out why it comes with any special force on his\nremembrance.\n\nHe is gradually emerging from Tom-all-Alone's in the morning light,\nthinking about it, when he hears running feet behind him, and looking\nround, sees the boy scouring towards him at great speed, followed by\nthe woman.\n\n\"Stop him, stop him!\" cries the woman, almost breathless. \"Stop him,\nsir!\"\n\nHe darts across the road into the boy's path, but the boy is quicker\nthan he, makes a curve, ducks, dives under his hands, comes up\nhalf-a-dozen yards beyond him, and scours away again. Still the woman\nfollows, crying, \"Stop him, sir, pray stop him!\" Allan, not knowing\nbut that he has just robbed her of her money, follows in chase and\nruns so hard that he runs the boy down a dozen times, but each time\nhe repeats the curve, the duck, the dive, and scours away again. To\nstrike at him on any of these occasions would be to fell and disable\nhim, but the pursuer cannot resolve to do that, and so the grimly\nridiculous pursuit continues. At last the fugitive, hard-pressed,\ntakes to a narrow passage and a court which has no thoroughfare.\nHere, against a hoarding of decaying timber, he is brought to bay and\ntumbles down, lying gasping at his pursuer, who stands and gasps at\nhim until the woman comes up.\n\n\"Oh, you, Jo!\" cries the woman. \"What? I have found you at last!\"\n\n\"Jo,\" repeats Allan, looking at him with attention, \"Jo! Stay. To be\nsure! I recollect this lad some time ago being brought before the\ncoroner.\"\n\n\"Yes, I see you once afore at the inkwhich,\" whimpers Jo. \"What of\nthat? Can't you never let such an unfortnet as me alone? An't I\nunfortnet enough for you yet? How unfortnet do you want me fur to be?\nI've been a-chivied and a-chivied, fust by one on you and nixt by\nanother on you, till I'm worritted to skins and bones. The inkwhich\nwarn't MY fault. I done nothink. He wos wery good to me, he wos; he\nwos the only one I knowed to speak to, as ever come across my\ncrossing. It ain't wery likely I should want him to be inkwhiched. I\nonly wish I wos, myself. I don't know why I don't go and make a hole\nin the water, I'm sure I don't.\"\n\nHe says it with such a pitiable air, and his grimy tears appear so\nreal, and he lies in the corner up against the hoarding so like a\ngrowth of fungus or any unwholesome excrescence produced there in\nneglect and impurity, that Allan Woodcourt is softened towards him.\nHe says to the woman, \"Miserable creature, what has he done?\"\n\nTo which she only replies, shaking her head at the prostrate figure\nmore amazedly than angrily, \"Oh, you Jo, you Jo. I have found you at\nlast!\"\n\n\"What has he done?\" says Allan. \"Has he robbed you?\"\n\n\"No, sir, no. Robbed me? He did nothing but what was kind-hearted by\nme, and that's the wonder of it.\"\n\nAllan looks from Jo to the woman, and from the woman to Jo, waiting\nfor one of them to unravel the riddle.\n\n\"But he was along with me, sir,\" says the woman. \"Oh, you Jo! He was\nalong with me, sir, down at Saint Albans, ill, and a young lady, Lord\nbless her for a good friend to me, took pity on him when I durstn't,\nand took him home--\"\n\nAllan shrinks back from him with a sudden horror.\n\n\"Yes, sir, yes. Took him home, and made him comfortable, and like a\nthankless monster he ran away in the night and never has been seen or\nheard of since till I set eyes on him just now. And that young lady\nthat was such a pretty dear caught his illness, lost her beautiful\nlooks, and wouldn't hardly be known for the same young lady now if it\nwasn't for her angel temper, and her pretty shape, and her sweet\nvoice. Do you know it? You ungrateful wretch, do you know that this\nis all along of you and of her goodness to you?\" demands the woman,\nbeginning to rage at him as she recalls it and breaking into\npassionate tears.\n\nThe boy, in rough sort stunned by what he hears, falls to smearing\nhis dirty forehead with his dirty palm, and to staring at the ground,\nand to shaking from head to foot until the crazy hoarding against\nwhich he leans rattles.\n\nAllan restrains the woman, merely by a quiet gesture, but\neffectually.\n\n\"Richard told me--\" He falters. \"I mean, I have heard of this--don't\nmind me for a moment, I will speak presently.\"\n\nHe turns away and stands for a while looking out at the covered\npassage. When he comes back, he has recovered his composure, except\nthat he contends against an avoidance of the boy, which is so very\nremarkable that it absorbs the woman's attention.\n\n\"You hear what she says. But get up, get up!\"\n\nJo, shaking and chattering, slowly rises and stands, after the manner\nof his tribe in a difficulty, sideways against the hoarding, resting\none of his high shoulders against it and covertly rubbing his right\nhand over his left and his left foot over his right.\n\n\"You hear what she says, and I know it's true. Have you been here\never since?\"\n\n\"Wishermaydie if I seen Tom-all-Alone's till this blessed morning,\"\nreplies Jo hoarsely.\n\n\"Why have you come here now?\"\n\nJo looks all round the confined court, looks at his questioner no\nhigher than the knees, and finally answers, \"I don't know how to do\nnothink, and I can't get nothink to do. I'm wery poor and ill, and I\nthought I'd come back here when there warn't nobody about, and lay\ndown and hide somewheres as I knows on till arter dark, and then go\nand beg a trifle of Mr. Snagsby. He wos allus willin fur to give me\nsomethink he wos, though Mrs. Snagsby she was allus a-chivying on\nme--like everybody everywheres.\"\n\n\"Where have you come from?\"\n\nJo looks all round the court again, looks at his questioner's knees\nagain, and concludes by laying his profile against the hoarding in a\nsort of resignation.\n\n\"Did you hear me ask you where you have come from?\"\n\n\"Tramp then,\" says Jo.\n\n\"Now tell me,\" proceeds Allan, making a strong effort to overcome his\nrepugnance, going very near to him, and leaning over him with an\nexpression of confidence, \"tell me how it came about that you left\nthat house when the good young lady had been so unfortunate as to\npity you and take you home.\"\n\nJo suddenly comes out of his resignation and excitedly declares,\naddressing the woman, that he never known about the young lady, that\nhe never heern about it, that he never went fur to hurt her, that he\nwould sooner have hurt his own self, that he'd sooner have had his\nunfortnet ed chopped off than ever gone a-nigh her, and that she wos\nwery good to him, she wos. Conducting himself throughout as if in his\npoor fashion he really meant it, and winding up with some very\nmiserable sobs.\n\nAllan Woodcourt sees that this is not a sham. He constrains himself\nto touch him. \"Come, Jo. Tell me.\"\n\n\"No. I dustn't,\" says Jo, relapsing into the profile state. \"I\ndustn't, or I would.\"\n\n\"But I must know,\" returns the other, \"all the same. Come, Jo.\"\n\nAfter two or three such adjurations, Jo lifts up his head again,\nlooks round the court again, and says in a low voice, \"Well, I'll\ntell you something. I was took away. There!\"\n\n\"Took away? In the night?\"\n\n\"Ah!\" Very apprehensive of being overheard, Jo looks about him and\neven glances up some ten feet at the top of the hoarding and through\nthe cracks in it lest the object of his distrust should be looking\nover or hidden on the other side.\n\n\"Who took you away?\"\n\n\"I dustn't name him,\" says Jo. \"I dustn't do it, sir.\n\n\"But I want, in the young lady's name, to know. You may trust me. No\none else shall hear.\"\n\n\"Ah, but I don't know,\" replies Jo, shaking his head fearfully, \"as\nhe DON'T hear.\"\n\n\"Why, he is not in this place.\"\n\n\"Oh, ain't he though?\" says Jo. \"He's in all manner of places, all at\nwanst.\"\n\nAllan looks at him in perplexity, but discovers some real meaning and\ngood faith at the bottom of this bewildering reply. He patiently\nawaits an explicit answer; and Jo, more baffled by his patience than\nby anything else, at last desperately whispers a name in his ear.\n\n\"Aye!\" says Allan. \"Why, what had you been doing?\"\n\n\"Nothink, sir. Never done nothink to get myself into no trouble,\n'sept in not moving on and the inkwhich. But I'm a-moving on now. I'm\na-moving on to the berryin ground--that's the move as I'm up to.\"\n\n\"No, no, we will try to prevent that. But what did he do with you?\"\n\n\"Put me in a horsepittle,\" replied Jo, whispering, \"till I was\ndischarged, then giv me a little money--four half-bulls, wot you may\ncall half-crowns--and ses 'Hook it! Nobody wants you here,' he ses.\n'You hook it. You go and tramp,' he ses. 'You move on,' he ses.\n'Don't let me ever see you nowheres within forty mile of London, or\nyou'll repent it.' So I shall, if ever he doos see me, and he'll see\nme if I'm above ground,\" concludes Jo, nervously repeating all his\nformer precautions and investigations.\n\nAllan considers a little, then remarks, turning to the woman but\nkeeping an encouraging eye on Jo, \"He is not so ungrateful as you\nsupposed. He had a reason for going away, though it was an\ninsufficient one.\"\n\n\"Thankee, sir, thankee!\" exclaims Jo. \"There now! See how hard you\nwos upon me. But ony you tell the young lady wot the genlmn ses, and\nit's all right. For YOU wos wery good to me too, and I knows it.\"\n\n\"Now, Jo,\" says Allan, keeping his eye upon him, \"come with me and I\nwill find you a better place than this to lie down and hide in. If I\ntake one side of the way and you the other to avoid observation, you\nwill not run away, I know very well, if you make me a promise.\"\n\n\"I won't, not unless I wos to see HIM a-coming, sir.\"\n\n\"Very well. I take your word. Half the town is getting up by this\ntime, and the whole town will be broad awake in another hour. Come\nalong. Good day again, my good woman.\"\n\n\"Good day again, sir, and I thank you kindly many times again.\"\n\nShe has been sitting on her bag, deeply attentive, and now rises and\ntakes it up. Jo, repeating, \"Ony you tell the young lady as I never\nwent fur to hurt her and wot the genlmn ses!\" nods and shambles and\nshivers, and smears and blinks, and half laughs and half cries, a\nfarewell to her, and takes his creeping way along after Allan\nWoodcourt, close to the houses on the opposite side of the street. In\nthis order, the two come up out of Tom-all-Alone's into the broad\nrays of the sunlight and the purer air.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLVII\n\nJo's Will\n\n\nAs Allan Woodcourt and Jo proceed along the streets where the high\nchurch spires and the distances are so near and clear in the morning\nlight that the city itself seems renewed by rest, Allan revolves in\nhis mind how and where he shall bestow his companion. \"It surely is a\nstrange fact,\" he considers, \"that in the heart of a civilized world\nthis creature in human form should be more difficult to dispose of\nthan an unowned dog.\" But it is none the less a fact because of its\nstrangeness, and the difficulty remains.\n\nAt first he looks behind him often to assure himself that Jo is still\nreally following. But look where he will, he still beholds him close\nto the opposite houses, making his way with his wary hand from brick\nto brick and from door to door, and often, as he creeps along,\nglancing over at him watchfully. Soon satisfied that the last thing\nin his thoughts is to give him the slip, Allan goes on, considering\nwith a less divided attention what he shall do.\n\nA breakfast-stall at a street-corner suggests the first thing to be\ndone. He stops there, looks round, and beckons Jo. Jo crosses and\ncomes halting and shuffling up, slowly scooping the knuckles of his\nright hand round and round in the hollowed palm of his left, kneading\ndirt with a natural pestle and mortar. What is a dainty repast to Jo\nis then set before him, and he begins to gulp the coffee and to gnaw\nthe bread and butter, looking anxiously about him in all directions\nas he eats and drinks, like a scared animal.\n\nBut he is so sick and miserable that even hunger has abandoned him.\n\"I thought I was amost a-starvin, sir,\" says Jo, soon putting down\nhis food, \"but I don't know nothink--not even that. I don't care for\neating wittles nor yet for drinking on 'em.\" And Jo stands shivering\nand looking at the breakfast wonderingly.\n\nAllan Woodcourt lays his hand upon his pulse and on his chest. \"Draw\nbreath, Jo!\" \"It draws,\" says Jo, \"as heavy as a cart.\" He might add,\n\"And rattles like it,\" but he only mutters, \"I'm a-moving on, sir.\"\n\nAllan looks about for an apothecary's shop. There is none at hand,\nbut a tavern does as well or better. He obtains a little measure of\nwine and gives the lad a portion of it very carefully. He begins to\nrevive almost as soon as it passes his lips. \"We may repeat that\ndose, Jo,\" observes Allan after watching him with his attentive face.\n\"So! Now we will take five minutes' rest, and then go on again.\"\n\nLeaving the boy sitting on the bench of the breakfast-stall, with his\nback against an iron railing, Allan Woodcourt paces up and down in\nthe early sunshine, casting an occasional look towards him without\nappearing to watch him. It requires no discernment to perceive that\nhe is warmed and refreshed. If a face so shaded can brighten, his\nface brightens somewhat; and by little and little he eats the slice\nof bread he had so hopelessly laid down. Observant of these signs of\nimprovement, Allan engages him in conversation and elicits to his no\nsmall wonder the adventure of the lady in the veil, with all its\nconsequences. Jo slowly munches as he slowly tells it. When he has\nfinished his story and his bread, they go on again.\n\nIntending to refer his difficulty in finding a temporary place of\nrefuge for the boy to his old patient, zealous little Miss Flite,\nAllan leads the way to the court where he and Jo first foregathered.\nBut all is changed at the rag and bottle shop; Miss Flite no longer\nlodges there; it is shut up; and a hard-featured female, much\nobscured by dust, whose age is a problem, but who is indeed no other\nthan the interesting Judy, is tart and spare in her replies. These\nsufficing, however, to inform the visitor that Miss Flite and her\nbirds are domiciled with a Mrs. Blinder, in Bell Yard, he repairs to\nthat neighbouring place, where Miss Flite (who rises early that she\nmay be punctual at the divan of justice held by her excellent friend\nthe Chancellor) comes running downstairs with tears of welcome and\nwith open arms.\n\n\"My dear physician!\" cries Miss Flite. \"My meritorious,\ndistinguished, honourable officer!\" She uses some odd expressions,\nbut is as cordial and full of heart as sanity itself can be--more so\nthan it often is. Allan, very patient with her, waits until she has\nno more raptures to express, then points out Jo, trembling in a\ndoorway, and tells her how he comes there.\n\n\"Where can I lodge him hereabouts for the present? Now, you have a\nfund of knowledge and good sense and can advise me.\"\n\nMiss Flite, mighty proud of the compliment, sets herself to consider;\nbut it is long before a bright thought occurs to her. Mrs. Blinder is\nentirely let, and she herself occupies poor Gridley's room.\n\"Gridley!\" exclaims Miss Flite, clapping her hands after a twentieth\nrepetition of this remark. \"Gridley! To be sure! Of course! My dear\nphysician! General George will help us out.\"\n\nIt is hopeless to ask for any information about General George, and\nwould be, though Miss Flite had not already run upstairs to put on\nher pinched bonnet and her poor little shawl and to arm herself with\nher reticule of documents. But as she informs her physician in her\ndisjointed manner on coming down in full array that General George,\nwhom she often calls upon, knows her dear Fitz Jarndyce and takes a\ngreat interest in all connected with her, Allan is induced to think\nthat they may be in the right way. So he tells Jo, for his\nencouragement, that this walking about will soon be over now; and\nthey repair to the general's. Fortunately it is not far.\n\nFrom the exterior of George's Shooting Gallery, and the long entry,\nand the bare perspective beyond it, Allan Woodcourt augurs well. He\nalso descries promise in the figure of Mr. George himself, striding\ntowards them in his morning exercise with his pipe in his mouth, no\nstock on, and his muscular arms, developed by broadsword and\ndumbbell, weightily asserting themselves through his light\nshirt-sleeves.\n\n\"Your servant, sir,\" says Mr. George with a military salute.\nGood-humouredly smiling all over his broad forehead up into his crisp\nhair, he then defers to Miss Flite, as, with great stateliness, and\nat some length, she performs the courtly ceremony of presentation. He\nwinds it up with another \"Your servant, sir!\" and another salute.\n\n\"Excuse me, sir. A sailor, I believe?\" says Mr. George.\n\n\"I am proud to find I have the air of one,\" returns Allan; \"but I am\nonly a sea-going doctor.\"\n\n\"Indeed, sir! I should have thought you was a regular blue-jacket\nmyself.\"\n\nAllan hopes Mr. George will forgive his intrusion the more readily on\nthat account, and particularly that he will not lay aside his pipe,\nwhich, in his politeness, he has testified some intention of doing.\n\"You are very good, sir,\" returns the trooper. \"As I know by\nexperience that it's not disagreeable to Miss Flite, and since it's\nequally agreeable to yourself--\" and finishes the sentence by putting\nit between his lips again. Allan proceeds to tell him all he knows\nabout Jo, unto which the trooper listens with a grave face.\n\n\"And that's the lad, sir, is it?\" he inquires, looking along the\nentry to where Jo stands staring up at the great letters on the\nwhitewashed front, which have no meaning in his eyes.\n\n\"That's he,\" says Allan. \"And, Mr. George, I am in this difficulty\nabout him. I am unwilling to place him in a hospital, even if I could\nprocure him immediate admission, because I foresee that he would not\nstay there many hours if he could be so much as got there. The same\nobjection applies to a workhouse, supposing I had the patience to be\nevaded and shirked, and handed about from post to pillar in trying to\nget him into one, which is a system that I don't take kindly to.\"\n\n\"No man does, sir,\" returns Mr. George.\n\n\"I am convinced that he would not remain in either place, because he\nis possessed by an extraordinary terror of this person who ordered\nhim to keep out of the way; in his ignorance, he believes this person\nto be everywhere, and cognizant of everything.\"\n\n\"I ask your pardon, sir,\" says Mr. George. \"But you have not\nmentioned that party's name. Is it a secret, sir?\"\n\n\"The boy makes it one. But his name is Bucket.\"\n\n\"Bucket the detective, sir?\"\n\n\"The same man.\"\n\n\"The man is known to me, sir,\" returns the trooper after blowing out\na cloud of smoke and squaring his chest, \"and the boy is so far\ncorrect that he undoubtedly is a--rum customer.\" Mr. George smokes\nwith a profound meaning after this and surveys Miss Flite in silence.\n\n\"Now, I wish Mr. Jarndyce and Miss Summerson at least to know that\nthis Jo, who tells so strange a story, has reappeared, and to have it\nin their power to speak with him if they should desire to do so.\nTherefore I want to get him, for the present moment, into any poor\nlodging kept by decent people where he would be admitted. Decent\npeople and Jo, Mr. George,\" says Allan, following the direction of\nthe trooper's eyes along the entry, \"have not been much acquainted,\nas you see. Hence the difficulty. Do you happen to know any one in\nthis neighbourhood who would receive him for a while on my paying for\nhim beforehand?\"\n\nAs he puts the question, he becomes aware of a dirty-faced little man\nstanding at the trooper's elbow and looking up, with an oddly twisted\nfigure and countenance, into the trooper's face. After a few more\npuffs at his pipe, the trooper looks down askant at the little man,\nand the little man winks up at the trooper.\n\n\"Well, sir,\" says Mr. George, \"I can assure you that I would\nwillingly be knocked on the head at any time if it would be at all\nagreeable to Miss Summerson, and consequently I esteem it a privilege\nto do that young lady any service, however small. We are naturally in\nthe vagabond way here, sir, both myself and Phil. You see what the\nplace is. You are welcome to a quiet corner of it for the boy if the\nsame would meet your views. No charge made, except for rations. We\nare not in a flourishing state of circumstances here, sir. We are\nliable to be tumbled out neck and crop at a moment's notice. However,\nsir, such as the place is, and so long as it lasts, here it is at\nyour service.\"\n\nWith a comprehensive wave of his pipe, Mr. George places the whole\nbuilding at his visitor's disposal.\n\n\"I take it for granted, sir,\" he adds, \"you being one of the medical\nstaff, that there is no present infection about this unfortunate\nsubject?\"\n\nAllan is quite sure of it.\n\n\"Because, sir,\" says Mr. George, shaking his head sorrowfully, \"we\nhave had enough of that.\"\n\nHis tone is no less sorrowfully echoed by his new acquaintance.\n\"Still I am bound to tell you,\" observes Allan after repeating his\nformer assurance, \"that the boy is deplorably low and reduced and\nthat he may be--I do not say that he is--too far gone to recover.\"\n\n\"Do you consider him in present danger, sir?\" inquires the trooper.\n\n\"Yes, I fear so.\"\n\n\"Then, sir,\" returns the trooper in a decisive manner, \"it appears to\nme--being naturally in the vagabond way myself--that the sooner he\ncomes out of the street, the better. You, Phil! Bring him in!\"\n\nMr. Squod tacks out, all on one side, to execute the word of command;\nand the trooper, having smoked his pipe, lays it by. Jo is brought\nin. He is not one of Mrs. Pardiggle's Tockahoopo Indians; he is not\none of Mrs. Jellyby's lambs, being wholly unconnected with\nBorrioboola-Gha; he is not softened by distance and unfamiliarity; he\nis not a genuine foreign-grown savage; he is the ordinary home-made\narticle. Dirty, ugly, disagreeable to all the senses, in body a\ncommon creature of the common streets, only in soul a heathen. Homely\nfilth begrimes him, homely parasites devour him, homely sores are in\nhim, homely rags are on him; native ignorance, the growth of English\nsoil and climate, sinks his immortal nature lower than the beasts\nthat perish. Stand forth, Jo, in uncompromising colours! From the\nsole of thy foot to the crown of thy head, there is nothing\ninteresting about thee.\n\nHe shuffles slowly into Mr. George's gallery and stands huddled\ntogether in a bundle, looking all about the floor. He seems to know\nthat they have an inclination to shrink from him, partly for what he\nis and partly for what he has caused. He, too, shrinks from them. He\nis not of the same order of things, not of the same place in\ncreation. He is of no order and no place, neither of the beasts nor\nof humanity.\n\n\"Look here, Jo!\" says Allan. \"This is Mr. George.\"\n\nJo searches the floor for some time longer, then looks up for a\nmoment, and then down again.\n\n\"He is a kind friend to you, for he is going to give you lodging room\nhere.\"\n\nJo makes a scoop with one hand, which is supposed to be a bow. After\na little more consideration and some backing and changing of the foot\non which he rests, he mutters that he is \"wery thankful.\"\n\n\"You are quite safe here. All you have to do at present is to be\nobedient and to get strong. And mind you tell us the truth here,\nwhatever you do, Jo.\"\n\n\"Wishermaydie if I don't, sir,\" says Jo, reverting to his favourite\ndeclaration. \"I never done nothink yit, but wot you knows on, to get\nmyself into no trouble. I never was in no other trouble at all, sir,\n'sept not knowin' nothink and starwation.\"\n\n\"I believe it, now attend to Mr. George. I see he is going to speak\nto you.\"\n\n\"My intention merely was, sir,\" observes Mr. George, amazingly broad\nand upright, \"to point out to him where he can lie down and get a\nthorough good dose of sleep. Now, look here.\" As the trooper speaks,\nhe conducts them to the other end of the gallery and opens one of the\nlittle cabins. \"There you are, you see! Here is a mattress, and here\nyou may rest, on good behaviour, as long as Mr., I ask your pardon,\nsir\"--he refers apologetically to the card Allan has given him--\"Mr.\nWoodcourt pleases. Don't you be alarmed if you hear shots; they'll be\naimed at the target, and not you. Now, there's another thing I would\nrecommend, sir,\" says the trooper, turning to his visitor. \"Phil,\ncome here!\"\n\nPhil bears down upon them according to his usual tactics. \"Here is a\nman, sir, who was found, when a baby, in the gutter. Consequently, it\nis to be expected that he takes a natural interest in this poor\ncreature. You do, don't you, Phil?\"\n\n\"Certainly and surely I do, guv'ner,\" is Phil's reply.\n\n\"Now I was thinking, sir,\" says Mr. George in a martial sort of\nconfidence, as if he were giving his opinion in a council of war at a\ndrum-head, \"that if this man was to take him to a bath and was to lay\nout a few shillings in getting him one or two coarse articles--\"\n\n\"Mr. George, my considerate friend,\" returns Allan, taking out his\npurse, \"it is the very favour I would have asked.\"\n\nPhil Squod and Jo are sent out immediately on this work of\nimprovement. Miss Flite, quite enraptured by her success, makes the\nbest of her way to court, having great fears that otherwise her\nfriend the Chancellor may be uneasy about her or may give the\njudgment she has so long expected in her absence, and observing\n\"which you know, my dear physician, and general, after so many years,\nwould be too absurdly unfortunate!\" Allan takes the opportunity of\ngoing out to procure some restorative medicines, and obtaining them\nnear at hand, soon returns to find the trooper walking up and down\nthe gallery, and to fall into step and walk with him.\n\n\"I take it, sir,\" says Mr. George, \"that you know Miss Summerson\npretty well?\"\n\nYes, it appears.\n\n\"Not related to her, sir?\"\n\nNo, it appears.\n\n\"Excuse the apparent curiosity,\" says Mr. George. \"It seemed to me\nprobable that you might take more than a common interest in this poor\ncreature because Miss Summerson had taken that unfortunate interest\nin him. 'Tis MY case, sir, I assure you.\"\n\n\"And mine, Mr. George.\"\n\nThe trooper looks sideways at Allan's sunburnt cheek and bright dark\neye, rapidly measures his height and build, and seems to approve of\nhim.\n\n\"Since you have been out, sir, I have been thinking that I\nunquestionably know the rooms in Lincoln's Inn Fields, where Bucket\ntook the lad, according to his account. Though he is not acquainted\nwith the name, I can help you to it. It's Tulkinghorn. That's what it\nis.\"\n\nAllan looks at him inquiringly, repeating the name.\n\n\"Tulkinghorn. That's the name, sir. I know the man, and know him to\nhave been in communication with Bucket before, respecting a deceased\nperson who had given him offence. I know the man, sir. To my sorrow.\"\n\nAllan naturally asks what kind of man he is.\n\n\"What kind of man! Do you mean to look at?\"\n\n\"I think I know that much of him. I mean to deal with. Generally,\nwhat kind of man?\"\n\n\"Why, then I'll tell you, sir,\" returns the trooper, stopping short\nand folding his arms on his square chest so angrily that his face\nfires and flushes all over; \"he is a confoundedly bad kind of man. He\nis a slow-torturing kind of man. He is no more like flesh and blood\nthan a rusty old carbine is. He is a kind of man--by George!--that\nhas caused me more restlessness, and more uneasiness, and more\ndissatisfaction with myself than all other men put together. That's\nthe kind of man Mr. Tulkinghorn is!\"\n\n\"I am sorry,\" says Allan, \"to have touched so sore a place.\"\n\n\"Sore?\" The trooper plants his legs wider apart, wets the palm of his\nbroad right hand, and lays it on the imaginary moustache. \"It's no\nfault of yours, sir; but you shall judge. He has got a power over me.\nHe is the man I spoke of just now as being able to tumble me out of\nthis place neck and crop. He keeps me on a constant see-saw. He won't\nhold off, and he won't come on. If I have a payment to make him, or\ntime to ask him for, or anything to go to him about, he don't see me,\ndon't hear me--passes me on to Melchisedech's in Clifford's Inn,\nMelchisedech's in Clifford's Inn passes me back again to him--he\nkeeps me prowling and dangling about him as if I was made of the same\nstone as himself. Why, I spend half my life now, pretty well,\nloitering and dodging about his door. What does he care? Nothing.\nJust as much as the rusty old carbine I have compared him to. He\nchafes and goads me till--Bah! Nonsense! I am forgetting myself. Mr.\nWoodcourt,\" the trooper resumes his march, \"all I say is, he is an\nold man; but I am glad I shall never have the chance of setting spurs\nto my horse and riding at him in a fair field. For if I had that\nchance, in one of the humours he drives me into--he'd go down, sir!\"\n\nMr. George has been so excited that he finds it necessary to wipe his\nforehead on his shirt-sleeve. Even while he whistles his impetuosity\naway with the national anthem, some involuntary shakings of his head\nand heavings of his chest still linger behind, not to mention an\noccasional hasty adjustment with both hands of his open shirt-collar,\nas if it were scarcely open enough to prevent his being troubled by a\nchoking sensation. In short, Allan Woodcourt has not much doubt about\nthe going down of Mr. Tulkinghorn on the field referred to.\n\nJo and his conductor presently return, and Jo is assisted to his\nmattress by the careful Phil, to whom, after due administration of\nmedicine by his own hands, Allan confides all needful means and\ninstructions. The morning is by this time getting on apace. He\nrepairs to his lodgings to dress and breakfast, and then, without\nseeking rest, goes away to Mr. Jarndyce to communicate his discovery.\n\nWith him Mr. Jarndyce returns alone, confidentially telling him that\nthere are reasons for keeping this matter very quiet indeed and\nshowing a serious interest in it. To Mr. Jarndyce, Jo repeats in\nsubstance what he said in the morning, without any material\nvariation. Only that cart of his is heavier to draw, and draws with a\nhollower sound.\n\n\"Let me lay here quiet and not be chivied no more,\" falters Jo, \"and\nbe so kind any person as is a-passin nigh where I used fur to sleep,\nas jist to say to Mr. Sangsby that Jo, wot he known once, is a-moving\non right forards with his duty, and I'll be wery thankful. I'd be\nmore thankful than I am aready if it wos any ways possible for an\nunfortnet to be it.\"\n\nHe makes so many of these references to the law-stationer in the\ncourse of a day or two that Allan, after conferring with Mr.\nJarndyce, good-naturedly resolves to call in Cook's Court, the\nrather, as the cart seems to be breaking down.\n\nTo Cook's Court, therefore, he repairs. Mr. Snagsby is behind his\ncounter in his grey coat and sleeves, inspecting an indenture of\nseveral skins which has just come in from the engrosser's, an immense\ndesert of law-hand and parchment, with here and there a resting-place\nof a few large letters to break the awful monotony and save the\ntraveller from despair. Mr Snagsby puts up at one of these inky wells\nand greets the stranger with his cough of general preparation for\nbusiness.\n\n\"You don't remember me, Mr. Snagsby?\"\n\nThe stationer's heart begins to thump heavily, for his old\napprehensions have never abated. It is as much as he can do to\nanswer, \"No, sir, I can't say I do. I should have considered--not to\nput too fine a point upon it--that I never saw you before, sir.\"\n\n\"Twice before,\" says Allan Woodcourt. \"Once at a poor bedside, and\nonce--\"\n\n\"It's come at last!\" thinks the afflicted stationer, as recollection\nbreaks upon him. \"It's got to a head now and is going to burst!\" But\nhe has sufficient presence of mind to conduct his visitor into the\nlittle counting-house and to shut the door.\n\n\"Are you a married man, sir?\"\n\n\"No, I am not.\"\n\n\"Would you make the attempt, though single,\" says Mr. Snagsby in a\nmelancholy whisper, \"to speak as low as you can? For my little woman\nis a-listening somewheres, or I'll forfeit the business and five\nhundred pound!\"\n\nIn deep dejection Mr. Snagsby sits down on his stool, with his back\nagainst his desk, protesting, \"I never had a secret of my own, sir. I\ncan't charge my memory with ever having once attempted to deceive my\nlittle woman on my own account since she named the day. I wouldn't\nhave done it, sir. Not to put too fine a point upon it, I couldn't\nhave done it, I dursn't have done it. Whereas, and nevertheless, I\nfind myself wrapped round with secrecy and mystery, till my life is a\nburden to me.\"\n\nHis visitor professes his regret to hear it and asks him does he\nremember Jo. Mr. Snagsby answers with a suppressed groan, oh, don't\nhe!\n\n\"You couldn't name an individual human being--except myself--that my\nlittle woman is more set and determined against than Jo,\" says Mr.\nSnagsby.\n\nAllan asks why.\n\n\"Why?\" repeats Mr. Snagsby, in his desperation clutching at the clump\nof hair at the back of his bald head. \"How should I know why? But you\nare a single person, sir, and may you long be spared to ask a married\nperson such a question!\"\n\nWith this beneficent wish, Mr. Snagsby coughs a cough of dismal\nresignation and submits himself to hear what the visitor has to\ncommunicate.\n\n\"There again!\" says Mr. Snagsby, who, between the earnestness of his\nfeelings and the suppressed tones of his voice is discoloured in the\nface. \"At it again, in a new direction! A certain person charges me,\nin the solemnest way, not to talk of Jo to any one, even my little\nwoman. Then comes another certain person, in the person of yourself,\nand charges me, in an equally solemn way, not to mention Jo to that\nother certain person above all other persons. Why, this is a private\nasylum! Why, not to put too fine a point upon it, this is Bedlam,\nsir!\" says Mr. Snagsby.\n\nBut it is better than he expected after all, being no explosion of\nthe mine below him or deepening of the pit into which he has fallen.\nAnd being tender-hearted and affected by the account he hears of Jo's\ncondition, he readily engages to \"look round\" as early in the evening\nas he can manage it quietly. He looks round very quietly when the\nevening comes, but it may turn out that Mrs. Snagsby is as quiet a\nmanager as he.\n\nJo is very glad to see his old friend and says, when they are left\nalone, that he takes it uncommon kind as Mr. Sangsby should come so\nfar out of his way on accounts of sich as him. Mr. Snagsby, touched\nby the spectacle before him, immediately lays upon the table half a\ncrown, that magic balsam of his for all kinds of wounds.\n\n\"And how do you find yourself, my poor lad?\" inquires the stationer\nwith his cough of sympathy.\n\n\"I am in luck, Mr. Sangsby, I am,\" returns Jo, \"and don't want for\nnothink. I'm more cumfbler nor you can't think. Mr. Sangsby! I'm wery\nsorry that I done it, but I didn't go fur to do it, sir.\"\n\nThe stationer softly lays down another half-crown and asks him what\nit is that he is sorry for having done.\n\n\"Mr. Sangsby,\" says Jo, \"I went and giv a illness to the lady as wos\nand yit as warn't the t'other lady, and none of 'em never says\nnothink to me for having done it, on accounts of their being ser good\nand my having been s'unfortnet. The lady come herself and see me\nyesday, and she ses, 'Ah, Jo!' she ses. 'We thought we'd lost you,\nJo!' she ses. And she sits down a-smilin so quiet, and don't pass a\nword nor yit a look upon me for having done it, she don't, and I\nturns agin the wall, I doos, Mr. Sangsby. And Mr. Jarnders, I see him\na-forced to turn away his own self. And Mr. Woodcot, he come fur to\ngiv me somethink fur to ease me, wot he's allus a-doin' on day and\nnight, and wen he come a-bending over me and a-speakin up so bold, I\nsee his tears a-fallin, Mr. Sangsby.\"\n\nThe softened stationer deposits another half-crown on the table.\nNothing less than a repetition of that infallible remedy will relieve\nhis feelings.\n\n\"Wot I was a-thinkin on, Mr. Sangsby,\" proceeds Jo, \"wos, as you wos\nable to write wery large, p'raps?\"\n\n\"Yes, Jo, please God,\" returns the stationer.\n\n\"Uncommon precious large, p'raps?\" says Jo with eagerness.\n\n\"Yes, my poor boy.\"\n\nJo laughs with pleasure. \"Wot I wos a-thinking on then, Mr. Sangsby,\nwos, that when I wos moved on as fur as ever I could go and couldn't\nbe moved no furder, whether you might be so good p'raps as to write\nout, wery large so that any one could see it anywheres, as that I wos\nwery truly hearty sorry that I done it and that I never went fur to\ndo it, and that though I didn't know nothink at all, I knowd as Mr.\nWoodcot once cried over it and wos allus grieved over it, and that I\nhoped as he'd be able to forgive me in his mind. If the writin could\nbe made to say it wery large, he might.\"\n\n\"It shall say it, Jo. Very large.\"\n\nJo laughs again. \"Thankee, Mr. Sangsby. It's wery kind of you, sir,\nand it makes me more cumfbler nor I was afore.\"\n\nThe meek little stationer, with a broken and unfinished cough, slips\ndown his fourth half-crown--he has never been so close to a case\nrequiring so many--and is fain to depart. And Jo and he, upon this\nlittle earth, shall meet no more. No more.\n\nFor the cart so hard to draw is near its journey's end and drags over\nstony ground. All round the clock it labours up the broken steps,\nshattered and worn. Not many times can the sun rise and behold it\nstill upon its weary road.\n\nPhil Squod, with his smoky gunpowder visage, at once acts as nurse\nand works as armourer at his little table in a corner, often looking\nround and saying with a nod of his green-baize cap and an encouraging\nelevation of his one eyebrow, \"Hold up, my boy! Hold up!\" There, too,\nis Mr. Jarndyce many a time, and Allan Woodcourt almost always, both\nthinking, much, how strangely fate has entangled this rough outcast\nin the web of very different lives. There, too, the trooper is a\nfrequent visitor, filling the doorway with his athletic figure and,\nfrom his superfluity of life and strength, seeming to shed down\ntemporary vigour upon Jo, who never fails to speak more robustly in\nanswer to his cheerful words.\n\nJo is in a sleep or in a stupor to-day, and Allan Woodcourt, newly\narrived, stands by him, looking down upon his wasted form. After a\nwhile he softly seats himself upon the bedside with his face towards\nhim--just as he sat in the law-writer's room--and touches his chest\nand heart. The cart had very nearly given up, but labours on a little\nmore.\n\nThe trooper stands in the doorway, still and silent. Phil has stopped\nin a low clinking noise, with his little hammer in his hand. Mr.\nWoodcourt looks round with that grave professional interest and\nattention on his face, and glancing significantly at the trooper,\nsigns to Phil to carry his table out. When the little hammer is next\nused, there will be a speck of rust upon it.\n\n\"Well, Jo! What is the matter? Don't be frightened.\"\n\n\"I thought,\" says Jo, who has started and is looking round, \"I\nthought I was in Tom-all-Alone's agin. Ain't there nobody here but\nyou, Mr. Woodcot?\"\n\n\"Nobody.\"\n\n\"And I ain't took back to Tom-all-Alone's. Am I, sir?\"\n\n\"No.\" Jo closes his eyes, muttering, \"I'm wery thankful.\"\n\nAfter watching him closely a little while, Allan puts his mouth very\nnear his ear and says to him in a low, distinct voice, \"Jo! Did you\never know a prayer?\"\n\n\"Never knowd nothink, sir.\"\n\n\"Not so much as one short prayer?\"\n\n\"No, sir. Nothink at all. Mr. Chadbands he wos a-prayin wunst at Mr.\nSangsby's and I heerd him, but he sounded as if he wos a-speakin to\nhisself, and not to me. He prayed a lot, but I couldn't make out\nnothink on it. Different times there was other genlmen come down\nTom-all-Alone's a-prayin, but they all mostly sed as the t'other\n'wuns prayed wrong, and all mostly sounded to be a-talking to\ntheirselves, or a-passing blame on the t'others, and not a-talkin to\nus. WE never knowd nothink. I never knowd what it wos all about.\"\n\nIt takes him a long time to say this, and few but an experienced and\nattentive listener could hear, or, hearing, understand him. After a\nshort relapse into sleep or stupor, he makes, of a sudden, a strong\neffort to get out of bed.\n\n\"Stay, Jo! What now?\"\n\n\"It's time for me to go to that there berryin ground, sir,\" he\nreturns with a wild look.\n\n\"Lie down, and tell me. What burying ground, Jo?\"\n\n\"Where they laid him as wos wery good to me, wery good to me indeed,\nhe wos. It's time fur me to go down to that there berryin ground,\nsir, and ask to be put along with him. I wants to go there and be\nberried. He used fur to say to me, 'I am as poor as you to-day, Jo,'\nhe ses. I wants to tell him that I am as poor as him now and have\ncome there to be laid along with him.\"\n\n\"By and by, Jo. By and by.\"\n\n\"Ah! P'raps they wouldn't do it if I wos to go myself. But will you\npromise to have me took there, sir, and laid along with him?\"\n\n\"I will, indeed.\"\n\n\"Thankee, sir. Thankee, sir. They'll have to get the key of the gate\nafore they can take me in, for it's allus locked. And there's a step\nthere, as I used for to clean with my broom. It's turned wery dark,\nsir. Is there any light a-comin?\"\n\n\"It is coming fast, Jo.\"\n\nFast. The cart is shaken all to pieces, and the rugged road is very\nnear its end.\n\n\"Jo, my poor fellow!\"\n\n\"I hear you, sir, in the dark, but I'm a-gropin--a-gropin--let me\ncatch hold of your hand.\"\n\n\"Jo, can you say what I say?\"\n\n\"I'll say anythink as you say, sir, for I knows it's good.\"\n\n\"Our Father.\"\n\n\"Our Father! Yes, that's wery good, sir.\"\n\n\"Which art in heaven.\"\n\n\"Art in heaven--is the light a-comin, sir?\"\n\n\"It is close at hand. Hallowed be thy name!\"\n\n\"Hallowed be--thy--\"\n\nThe light is come upon the dark benighted way. Dead!\n\nDead, your Majesty. Dead, my lords and gentlemen. Dead, right\nreverends and wrong reverends of every order. Dead, men and women,\nborn with heavenly compassion in your hearts. And dying thus around\nus every day.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLVIII\n\nClosing In\n\n\nThe place in Lincolnshire has shut its many eyes again, and the house\nin town is awake. In Lincolnshire the Dedlocks of the past doze in\ntheir picture-frames, and the low wind murmurs through the long\ndrawing-room as if they were breathing pretty regularly. In town the\nDedlocks of the present rattle in their fire-eyed carriages through\nthe darkness of the night, and the Dedlock Mercuries, with ashes (or\nhair-powder) on their heads, symptomatic of their great humility,\nloll away the drowsy mornings in the little windows of the hall. The\nfashionable world--tremendous orb, nearly five miles round--is in\nfull swing, and the solar system works respectfully at its appointed\ndistances.\n\nWhere the throng is thickest, where the lights are brightest, where\nall the senses are ministered to with the greatest delicacy and\nrefinement, Lady Dedlock is. From the shining heights she has scaled\nand taken, she is never absent. Though the belief she of old reposed\nin herself as one able to reserve whatsoever she would under\nher mantle of pride is beaten down, though she has no assurance\nthat what she is to those around her she will remain another day,\nit is not in her nature when envious eyes are looking on to\nyield or to droop. They say of her that she has lately grown\nmore handsome and more haughty. The debilitated cousin says of\nher that she's beauty nough--tsetup shopofwomen--but rather\nlarming kind--remindingmanfact--inconvenient woman--who WILL\ngetoutofbedandbawthstahlishment--Shakespeare.\n\nMr. Tulkinghorn says nothing, looks nothing. Now, as heretofore, he\nis to be found in doorways of rooms, with his limp white cravat\nloosely twisted into its old-fashioned tie, receiving patronage from\nthe peerage and making no sign. Of all men he is still the last who\nmight be supposed to have any influence upon my Lady. Of all women\nshe is still the last who might be supposed to have any dread of him.\n\nOne thing has been much on her mind since their late interview in his\nturret-room at Chesney Wold. She is now decided, and prepared to\nthrow it off.\n\nIt is morning in the great world, afternoon according to the little\nsun. The Mercuries, exhausted by looking out of window, are reposing\nin the hall and hang their heavy heads, the gorgeous creatures, like\noverblown sunflowers. Like them, too, they seem to run to a deal of\nseed in their tags and trimmings. Sir Leicester, in the library, has\nfallen asleep for the good of the country over the report of a\nParliamentary committee. My Lady sits in the room in which she gave\naudience to the young man of the name of Guppy. Rosa is with her and\nhas been writing for her and reading to her. Rosa is now at work upon\nembroidery or some such pretty thing, and as she bends her head over\nit, my Lady watches her in silence. Not for the first time to-day.\n\n\"Rosa.\"\n\nThe pretty village face looks brightly up. Then, seeing how serious\nmy Lady is, looks puzzled and surprised.\n\n\"See to the door. Is it shut?\"\n\nYes. She goes to it and returns, and looks yet more surprised.\n\n\"I am about to place confidence in you, child, for I know I may trust\nyour attachment, if not your judgment. In what I am going to do, I\nwill not disguise myself to you at least. But I confide in you. Say\nnothing to any one of what passes between us.\"\n\nThe timid little beauty promises in all earnestness to be\ntrustworthy.\n\n\"Do you know,\" Lady Dedlock asks her, signing to her to bring her\nchair nearer, \"do you know, Rosa, that I am different to you from\nwhat I am to any one?\"\n\n\"Yes, my Lady. Much kinder. But then I often think I know you as you\nreally are.\"\n\n\"You often think you know me as I really am? Poor child, poor child!\"\n\nShe says it with a kind of scorn--though not of Rosa--and sits\nbrooding, looking dreamily at her.\n\n\"Do you think, Rosa, you are any relief or comfort to me? Do you\nsuppose your being young and natural, and fond of me and grateful to\nme, makes it any pleasure to me to have you near me?\"\n\n\"I don't know, my Lady; I can scarcely hope so. But with all my\nheart, I wish it was so.\"\n\n\"It is so, little one.\"\n\nThe pretty face is checked in its flush of pleasure by the dark\nexpression on the handsome face before it. It looks timidly for an\nexplanation.\n\n\"And if I were to say to-day, 'Go! Leave me!' I should say what would\ngive me great pain and disquiet, child, and what would leave me very\nsolitary.\"\n\n\"My Lady! Have I offended you?\"\n\n\"In nothing. Come here.\"\n\nRosa bends down on the footstool at my Lady's feet. My Lady, with\nthat motherly touch of the famous ironmaster night, lays her hand\nupon her dark hair and gently keeps it there.\n\n\"I told you, Rosa, that I wished you to be happy and that I would\nmake you so if I could make anybody happy on this earth. I cannot.\nThere are reasons now known to me, reasons in which you have no part,\nrendering it far better for you that you should not remain here. You\nmust not remain here. I have determined that you shall not. I have\nwritten to the father of your lover, and he will be here to-day. All\nthis I have done for your sake.\"\n\nThe weeping girl covers her hand with kisses and says what shall she\ndo, what shall she do, when they are separated! Her mistress kisses\nher on the cheek and makes no other answer.\n\n\"Now, be happy, child, under better circumstances. Be beloved and\nhappy!\"\n\n\"Ah, my Lady, I have sometimes thought--forgive my being so\nfree--that YOU are not happy.\"\n\n\"I!\"\n\n\"Will you be more so when you have sent me away? Pray, pray, think\nagain. Let me stay a little while!\"\n\n\"I have said, my child, that what I do, I do for your sake, not my\nown. It is done. What I am towards you, Rosa, is what I am now--not\nwhat I shall be a little while hence. Remember this, and keep my\nconfidence. Do so much for my sake, and thus all ends between us!\"\n\nShe detaches herself from her simple-hearted companion and leaves the\nroom. Late in the afternoon, when she next appears upon the\nstaircase, she is in her haughtiest and coldest state. As indifferent\nas if all passion, feeling, and interest had been worn out in the\nearlier ages of the world and had perished from its surface with its\nother departed monsters.\n\nMercury has announced Mr. Rouncewell, which is the cause of her\nappearance. Mr. Rouncewell is not in the library, but she repairs to\nthe library. Sir Leicester is there, and she wishes to speak to him\nfirst.\n\n\"Sir Leicester, I am desirous--but you are engaged.\"\n\nOh, dear no! Not at all. Only Mr. Tulkinghorn.\n\nAlways at hand. Haunting every place. No relief or security from him\nfor a moment.\n\n\"I beg your pardon, Lady Dedlock. Will you allow me to retire?\"\n\nWith a look that plainly says, \"You know you have the power to remain\nif you will,\" she tells him it is not necessary and moves towards a\nchair. Mr. Tulkinghorn brings it a little forward for her with his\nclumsy bow and retires into a window opposite. Interposed between her\nand the fading light of day in the now quiet street, his shadow falls\nupon her, and he darkens all before her. Even so does he darken her\nlife.\n\nIt is a dull street under the best conditions, where the two long\nrows of houses stare at each other with that severity that\nhalf-a-dozen of its greatest mansions seem to have been slowly stared\ninto stone rather than originally built in that material. It is a\nstreet of such dismal grandeur, so determined not to condescend to\nliveliness, that the doors and windows hold a gloomy state of their\nown in black paint and dust, and the echoing mews behind have a dry\nand massive appearance, as if they were reserved to stable the stone\nchargers of noble statues. Complicated garnish of iron-work entwines\nitself over the flights of steps in this awful street, and from these\npetrified bowers, extinguishers for obsolete flambeaux gasp at the\nupstart gas. Here and there a weak little iron hoop, through which\nbold boys aspire to throw their friends' caps (its only present use),\nretains its place among the rusty foliage, sacred to the memory of\ndeparted oil. Nay, even oil itself, yet lingering at long intervals\nin a little absurd glass pot, with a knob in the bottom like an\noyster, blinks and sulks at newer lights every night, like its high\nand dry master in the House of Lords.\n\nTherefore there is not much that Lady Dedlock, seated in her chair,\ncould wish to see through the window in which Mr. Tulkinghorn stands.\nAnd yet--and yet--she sends a look in that direction as if it were\nher heart's desire to have that figure moved out of the way.\n\nSir Leicester begs his Lady's pardon. She was about to say?\n\n\"Only that Mr. Rouncewell is here (he has called by my appointment)\nand that we had better make an end of the question of that girl. I am\ntired to death of the matter.\"\n\n\"What can I do--to--assist?\" demands Sir Leicester in some\nconsiderable doubt.\n\n\"Let us see him here and have done with it. Will you tell them to\nsend him up?\"\n\n\"Mr. Tulkinghorn, be so good as to ring. Thank you. Request,\" says\nSir Leicester to Mercury, not immediately remembering the business\nterm, \"request the iron gentleman to walk this way.\"\n\nMercury departs in search of the iron gentleman, finds, and produces\nhim. Sir Leicester receives that ferruginous person graciously.\n\n\"I hope you are well, Mr. Rouncewell. Be seated. (My solicitor, Mr.\nTulkinghorn.) My Lady was desirous, Mr. Rouncewell,\" Sir Leicester\nskilfully transfers him with a solemn wave of his hand, \"was desirous\nto speak with you. Hem!\"\n\n\"I shall be very happy,\" returns the iron gentleman, \"to give my best\nattention to anything Lady Dedlock does me the honour to say.\"\n\nAs he turns towards her, he finds that the impression she makes upon\nhim is less agreeable than on the former occasion. A distant\nsupercilious air makes a cold atmosphere about her, and there is\nnothing in her bearing, as there was before, to encourage openness.\n\n\"Pray, sir,\" says Lady Dedlock listlessly, \"may I be allowed to\ninquire whether anything has passed between you and your son\nrespecting your son's fancy?\"\n\nIt is almost too troublesome to her languid eyes to bestow a look\nupon him as she asks this question.\n\n\"If my memory serves me, Lady Dedlock, I said, when I had the\npleasure of seeing you before, that I should seriously advise my son\nto conquer that--fancy.\" The ironmaster repeats her expression with a\nlittle emphasis.\n\n\"And did you?\"\n\n\"Oh! Of course I did.\"\n\nSir Leicester gives a nod, approving and confirmatory. Very proper.\nThe iron gentleman, having said that he would do it, was bound to do\nit. No difference in this respect between the base metals and the\nprecious. Highly proper.\n\n\"And pray has he done so?\"\n\n\"Really, Lady Dedlock, I cannot make you a definite reply. I fear\nnot. Probably not yet. In our condition of life, we sometimes couple\nan intention with our--our fancies which renders them not altogether\neasy to throw off. I think it is rather our way to be in earnest.\"\n\nSir Leicester has a misgiving that there may be a hidden Wat Tylerish\nmeaning in this expression, and fumes a little. Mr. Rouncewell is\nperfectly good-humoured and polite, but within such limits, evidently\nadapts his tone to his reception.\n\n\"Because,\" proceeds my Lady, \"I have been thinking of the subject,\nwhich is tiresome to me.\"\n\n\"I am very sorry, I am sure.\"\n\n\"And also of what Sir Leicester said upon it, in which I quite\nconcur\"--Sir Leicester flattered--\"and if you cannot give us the\nassurance that this fancy is at an end, I have come to the conclusion\nthat the girl had better leave me.\"\n\n\"I can give no such assurance, Lady Dedlock. Nothing of the kind.\"\n\n\"Then she had better go.\"\n\n\"Excuse me, my Lady,\" Sir Leicester considerately interposes, \"but\nperhaps this may be doing an injury to the young woman which she has\nnot merited. Here is a young woman,\" says Sir Leicester,\nmagnificently laying out the matter with his right hand like a\nservice of plate, \"whose good fortune it is to have attracted the\nnotice and favour of an eminent lady and to live, under the\nprotection of that eminent lady, surrounded by the various advantages\nwhich such a position confers, and which are unquestionably very\ngreat--I believe unquestionably very great, sir--for a young woman in\nthat station of life. The question then arises, should that young\nwoman be deprived of these many advantages and that good fortune\nsimply because she has\"--Sir Leicester, with an apologetic but\ndignified inclination of his head towards the ironmaster, winds up\nhis sentence--\"has attracted the notice of Mr Rouncewell's son? Now,\nhas she deserved this punishment? Is this just towards her? Is this\nour previous understanding?\"\n\n\"I beg your pardon,\" interposes Mr. Rouncewell's son's father. \"Sir\nLeicester, will you allow me? I think I may shorten the subject. Pray\ndismiss that from your consideration. If you remember anything so\nunimportant--which is not to be expected--you would recollect that my\nfirst thought in the affair was directly opposed to her remaining\nhere.\"\n\nDismiss the Dedlock patronage from consideration? Oh! Sir Leicester\nis bound to believe a pair of ears that have been handed down to him\nthrough such a family, or he really might have mistrusted their\nreport of the iron gentleman's observations.\n\n\"It is not necessary,\" observes my Lady in her coldest manner before\nhe can do anything but breathe amazedly, \"to enter into these matters\non either side. The girl is a very good girl; I have nothing whatever\nto say against her, but she is so far insensible to her many\nadvantages and her good fortune that she is in love--or supposes she\nis, poor little fool--and unable to appreciate them.\"\n\nSir Leicester begs to observe that wholly alters the case. He might\nhave been sure that my Lady had the best grounds and reasons in\nsupport of her view. He entirely agrees with my Lady. The young woman\nhad better go.\n\n\"As Sir Leicester observed, Mr. Rouncewell, on the last occasion when\nwe were fatigued by this business,\" Lady Dedlock languidly proceeds,\n\"we cannot make conditions with you. Without conditions, and under\npresent circumstances, the girl is quite misplaced here and had\nbetter go. I have told her so. Would you wish to have her sent back\nto the village, or would you like to take her with you, or what would\nyou prefer?\"\n\n\"Lady Dedlock, if I may speak plainly--\"\n\n\"By all means.\"\n\n\"--I should prefer the course which will the soonest relieve you of\nthe incumbrance and remove her from her present position.\"\n\n\"And to speak as plainly,\" she returns with the same studied\ncarelessness, \"so should I. Do I understand that you will take her\nwith you?\"\n\nThe iron gentleman makes an iron bow.\n\n\"Sir Leicester, will you ring?\" Mr. Tulkinghorn steps forward from\nhis window and pulls the bell. \"I had forgotten you. Thank you.\" He\nmakes his usual bow and goes quietly back again. Mercury,\nswift-responsive, appears, receives instructions whom to produce,\nskims away, produces the aforesaid, and departs.\n\nRosa has been crying and is yet in distress. On her coming in, the\nironmaster leaves his chair, takes her arm in his, and remains with\nher near the door ready to depart.\n\n\"You are taken charge of, you see,\" says my Lady in her weary manner,\n\"and are going away well protected. I have mentioned that you are a\nvery good girl, and you have nothing to cry for.\"\n\n\"She seems after all,\" observes Mr. Tulkinghorn, loitering a little\nforward with his hands behind him, \"as if she were crying at going\naway.\"\n\n\"Why, she is not well-bred, you see,\" returns Mr. Rouncewell with\nsome quickness in his manner, as if he were glad to have the lawyer\nto retort upon, \"and she is an inexperienced little thing and knows\nno better. If she had remained here, sir, she would have improved, no\ndoubt.\"\n\n\"No doubt,\" is Mr. Tulkinghorn's composed reply.\n\nRosa sobs out that she is very sorry to leave my Lady, and that she\nwas happy at Chesney Wold, and has been happy with my Lady, and that\nshe thanks my Lady over and over again. \"Out, you silly little puss!\"\nsays the ironmaster, checking her in a low voice, though not angrily.\n\"Have a spirit, if you're fond of Watt!\" My Lady merely waves her off\nwith indifference, saying, \"There, there, child! You are a good girl.\nGo away!\" Sir Leicester has magnificently disengaged himself from the\nsubject and retired into the sanctuary of his blue coat. Mr.\nTulkinghorn, an indistinct form against the dark street now dotted\nwith lamps, looms in my Lady's view, bigger and blacker than before.\n\n\"Sir Leicester and Lady Dedlock,\" says Mr. Rouncewell after a pause\nof a few moments, \"I beg to take my leave, with an apology for having\nagain troubled you, though not of my own act, on this tiresome\nsubject. I can very well understand, I assure you, how tiresome so\nsmall a matter must have become to Lady Dedlock. If I am doubtful of\nmy dealing with it, it is only because I did not at first quietly\nexert my influence to take my young friend here away without\ntroubling you at all. But it appeared to me--I dare say magnifying\nthe importance of the thing--that it was respectful to explain to you\nhow the matter stood and candid to consult your wishes and\nconvenience. I hope you will excuse my want of acquaintance with the\npolite world.\"\n\nSir Leicester considers himself evoked out of the sanctuary by these\nremarks. \"Mr. Rouncewell,\" he returns, \"do not mention it.\nJustifications are unnecessary, I hope, on either side.\"\n\n\"I am glad to hear it, Sir Leicester; and if I may, by way of a last\nword, revert to what I said before of my mother's long connexion with\nthe family and the worth it bespeaks on both sides, I would point out\nthis little instance here on my arm who shows herself so affectionate\nand faithful in parting and in whom my mother, I dare say, has done\nsomething to awaken such feelings--though of course Lady Dedlock, by\nher heartfelt interest and her genial condescension, has done much\nmore.\"\n\nIf he mean this ironically, it may be truer than he thinks. He points\nit, however, by no deviation from his straightforward manner of\nspeech, though in saying it he turns towards that part of the dim\nroom where my Lady sits. Sir Leicester stands to return his parting\nsalutation, Mr. Tulkinghorn again rings, Mercury takes another\nflight, and Mr. Rouncewell and Rosa leave the house.\n\nThen lights are brought in, discovering Mr. Tulkinghorn still\nstanding in his window with his hands behind him and my Lady still\nsitting with his figure before her, closing up her view of the night\nas well as of the day. She is very pale. Mr. Tulkinghorn, observing\nit as she rises to retire, thinks, \"Well she may be! The power of\nthis woman is astonishing. She has been acting a part the whole\ntime.\" But he can act a part too--his one unchanging character--and\nas he holds the door open for this woman, fifty pairs of eyes, each\nfifty times sharper than Sir Leicester's pair, should find no flaw in\nhim.\n\nLady Dedlock dines alone in her own room to-day. Sir Leicester is\nwhipped in to the rescue of the Doodle Party and the discomfiture of\nthe Coodle Faction. Lady Dedlock asks on sitting down to dinner,\nstill deadly pale (and quite an illustration of the debilitated\ncousin's text), whether he is gone out? Yes. Whether Mr. Tulkinghorn\nis gone yet? No. Presently she asks again, is he gone YET? No. What\nis he doing? Mercury thinks he is writing letters in the library.\nWould my Lady wish to see him? Anything but that.\n\nBut he wishes to see my Lady. Within a few more minutes he is\nreported as sending his respects, and could my Lady please to receive\nhim for a word or two after her dinner? My Lady will receive him now.\nHe comes now, apologizing for intruding, even by her permission,\nwhile she is at table. When they are alone, my Lady waves her hand to\ndispense with such mockeries.\n\n\"What do you want, sir?\"\n\n\"Why, Lady Dedlock,\" says the lawyer, taking a chair at a little\ndistance from her and slowly rubbing his rusty legs up and down, up\nand down, up and down, \"I am rather surprised by the course you have\ntaken.\"\n\n\"Indeed?\"\n\n\"Yes, decidedly. I was not prepared for it. I consider it a departure\nfrom our agreement and your promise. It puts us in a new position,\nLady Dedlock. I feel myself under the necessity of saying that I\ndon't approve of it.\"\n\nHe stops in his rubbing and looks at her, with his hands on his\nknees. Imperturbable and unchangeable as he is, there is still an\nindefinable freedom in his manner which is new and which does not\nescape this woman's observation.\n\n\"I do not quite understand you.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes you do, I think. I think you do. Come, come, Lady Dedlock,\nwe must not fence and parry now. You know you like this girl.\"\n\n\"Well, sir?\"\n\n\"And you know--and I know--that you have not sent her away for the\nreasons you have assigned, but for the purpose of separating her as\nmuch as possible from--excuse my mentioning it as a matter of\nbusiness--any reproach and exposure that impend over yourself.\"\n\n\"Well, sir?\"\n\n\"Well, Lady Dedlock,\" returns the lawyer, crossing his legs and\nnursing the uppermost knee. \"I object to that. I consider that a\ndangerous proceeding. I know it to be unnecessary and calculated to\nawaken speculation, doubt, rumour, I don't know what, in the house.\nBesides, it is a violation of our agreement. You were to be exactly\nwhat you were before. Whereas, it must be evident to yourself, as it\nis to me, that you have been this evening very different from what\nyou were before. Why, bless my soul, Lady Dedlock, transparently so!\"\n\n\"If, sir,\" she begins, \"in my knowledge of my secret--\" But he\ninterrupts her.\n\n\"Now, Lady Dedlock, this is a matter of business, and in a matter of\nbusiness the ground cannot be kept too clear. It is no longer your\nsecret. Excuse me. That is just the mistake. It is my secret, in\ntrust for Sir Leicester and the family. If it were your secret, Lady\nDedlock, we should not be here holding this conversation.\"\n\n\"That is very true. If in my knowledge of THE secret I do what I can\nto spare an innocent girl (especially, remembering your own reference\nto her when you told my story to the assembled guests at Chesney\nWold) from the taint of my impending shame, I act upon a resolution I\nhave taken. Nothing in the world, and no one in the world, could\nshake it or could move me.\" This she says with great deliberation and\ndistinctness and with no more outward passion than himself. As for\nhim, he methodically discusses his matter of business as if she were\nany insensible instrument used in business.\n\n\"Really? Then you see, Lady Dedlock,\" he returns, \"you are not to be\ntrusted. You have put the case in a perfectly plain way, and\naccording to the literal fact; and that being the case, you are not\nto be trusted.\"\n\n\"Perhaps you may remember that I expressed some anxiety on this same\npoint when we spoke at night at Chesney Wold?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" says Mr. Tulkinghorn, coolly getting up and standing on the\nhearth. \"Yes. I recollect, Lady Dedlock, that you certainly referred\nto the girl, but that was before we came to our arrangement, and both\nthe letter and the spirit of our arrangement altogether precluded any\naction on your part founded upon my discovery. There can be no doubt\nabout that. As to sparing the girl, of what importance or value is\nshe? Spare! Lady Dedlock, here is a family name compromised. One\nmight have supposed that the course was straight on--over everything,\nneither to the right nor to the left, regardless of all\nconsiderations in the way, sparing nothing, treading everything under\nfoot.\"\n\nShe has been looking at the table. She lifts up her eyes and looks at\nhim. There is a stern expression on her face and a part of her lower\nlip is compressed under her teeth. \"This woman understands me,\" Mr.\nTulkinghorn thinks as she lets her glance fall again. \"SHE cannot be\nspared. Why should she spare others?\"\n\nFor a little while they are silent. Lady Dedlock has eaten no dinner,\nbut has twice or thrice poured out water with a steady hand and drunk\nit. She rises from table, takes a lounging-chair, and reclines in it,\nshading her face. There is nothing in her manner to express weakness\nor excite compassion. It is thoughtful, gloomy, concentrated. \"This\nwoman,\" thinks Mr. Tulkinghorn, standing on the hearth, again a dark\nobject closing up her view, \"is a study.\"\n\nHe studies her at his leisure, not speaking for a time. She too\nstudies something at her leisure. She is not the first to speak,\nappearing indeed so unlikely to be so, though he stood there until\nmidnight, that even he is driven upon breaking silence.\n\n\"Lady Dedlock, the most disagreeable part of this business interview\nremains, but it is business. Our agreement is broken. A lady of your\nsense and strength of character will be prepared for my now declaring\nit void and taking my own course.\"\n\n\"I am quite prepared.\"\n\nMr. Tulkinghorn inclines his head. \"That is all I have to trouble you\nwith, Lady Dedlock.\"\n\nShe stops him as he is moving out of the room by asking, \"This is the\nnotice I was to receive? I wish not to misapprehend you.\"\n\n\"Not exactly the notice you were to receive, Lady Dedlock, because\nthe contemplated notice supposed the agreement to have been observed.\nBut virtually the same, virtually the same. The difference is merely\nin a lawyer's mind.\"\n\n\"You intend to give me no other notice?\"\n\n\"You are right. No.\"\n\n\"Do you contemplate undeceiving Sir Leicester to-night?\"\n\n\"A home question!\" says Mr. Tulkinghorn with a slight smile and\ncautiously shaking his head at the shaded face. \"No, not to-night.\"\n\n\"To-morrow?\"\n\n\"All things considered, I had better decline answering that question,\nLady Dedlock. If I were to say I don't know when, exactly, you would\nnot believe me, and it would answer no purpose. It may be to-morrow.\nI would rather say no more. You are prepared, and I hold out no\nexpectations which circumstances might fail to justify. I wish you\ngood evening.\"\n\nShe removes her hand, turns her pale face towards him as he walks\nsilently to the door, and stops him once again as he is about to open\nit.\n\n\"Do you intend to remain in the house any time? I heard you were\nwriting in the library. Are you going to return there?\"\n\n\"Only for my hat. I am going home.\"\n\nShe bows her eyes rather than her head, the movement is so slight and\ncurious, and he withdraws. Clear of the room he looks at his watch\nbut is inclined to doubt it by a minute or thereabouts. There is a\nsplendid clock upon the staircase, famous, as splendid clocks not\noften are, for its accuracy. \"And what do YOU say,\" Mr. Tulkinghorn\ninquires, referring to it. \"What do you say?\"\n\nIf it said now, \"Don't go home!\" What a famous clock, hereafter, if\nit said to-night of all the nights that it has counted off, to this\nold man of all the young and old men who have ever stood before it,\n\"Don't go home!\" With its sharp clear bell it strikes three quarters\nafter seven and ticks on again. \"Why, you are worse than I thought\nyou,\" says Mr. Tulkinghorn, muttering reproof to his watch. \"Two\nminutes wrong? At this rate you won't last my time.\" What a watch to\nreturn good for evil if it ticked in answer, \"Don't go home!\"\n\nHe passes out into the streets and walks on, with his hands behind\nhim, under the shadow of the lofty houses, many of whose mysteries,\ndifficulties, mortgages, delicate affairs of all kinds, are treasured\nup within his old black satin waistcoat. He is in the confidence of\nthe very bricks and mortar. The high chimney-stacks telegraph family\nsecrets to him. Yet there is not a voice in a mile of them to\nwhisper, \"Don't go home!\"\n\nThrough the stir and motion of the commoner streets; through the roar\nand jar of many vehicles, many feet, many voices; with the blazing\nshop-lights lighting him on, the west wind blowing him on, and the\ncrowd pressing him on, he is pitilessly urged upon his way, and\nnothing meets him murmuring, \"Don't go home!\" Arrived at last in his\ndull room to light his candles, and look round and up, and see the\nRoman pointing from the ceiling, there is no new significance in the\nRoman's hand to-night or in the flutter of the attendant groups to\ngive him the late warning, \"Don't come here!\"\n\nIt is a moonlight night, but the moon, being past the full, is only\nnow rising over the great wilderness of London. The stars are shining\nas they shone above the turret-leads at Chesney Wold. This woman, as\nhe has of late been so accustomed to call her, looks out upon them.\nHer soul is turbulent within her; she is sick at heart and restless.\nThe large rooms are too cramped and close. She cannot endure their\nrestraint and will walk alone in a neighbouring garden.\n\nToo capricious and imperious in all she does to be the cause of much\nsurprise in those about her as to anything she does, this woman,\nloosely muffled, goes out into the moonlight. Mercury attends with\nthe key. Having opened the garden-gate, he delivers the key into his\nLady's hands at her request and is bidden to go back. She will walk\nthere some time to ease her aching head. She may be an hour, she may\nbe more. She needs no further escort. The gate shuts upon its spring\nwith a clash, and he leaves her passing on into the dark shade of\nsome trees.\n\nA fine night, and a bright large moon, and multitudes of stars. Mr.\nTulkinghorn, in repairing to his cellar and in opening and shutting\nthose resounding doors, has to cross a little prison-like yard. He\nlooks up casually, thinking what a fine night, what a bright large\nmoon, what multitudes of stars! A quiet night, too.\n\nA very quiet night. When the moon shines very brilliantly, a solitude\nand stillness seem to proceed from her that influence even crowded\nplaces full of life. Not only is it a still night on dusty high roads\nand on hill-summits, whence a wide expanse of country may be seen in\nrepose, quieter and quieter as it spreads away into a fringe of trees\nagainst the sky with the grey ghost of a bloom upon them; not only is\nit a still night in gardens and in woods, and on the river where the\nwater-meadows are fresh and green, and the stream sparkles on among\npleasant islands, murmuring weirs, and whispering rushes; not only\ndoes the stillness attend it as it flows where houses cluster thick,\nwhere many bridges are reflected in it, where wharves and shipping\nmake it black and awful, where it winds from these disfigurements\nthrough marshes whose grim beacons stand like skeletons washed\nashore, where it expands through the bolder region of rising grounds,\nrich in cornfield wind-mill and steeple, and where it mingles with\nthe ever-heaving sea; not only is it a still night on the deep, and\non the shore where the watcher stands to see the ship with her spread\nwings cross the path of light that appears to be presented to only\nhim; but even on this stranger's wilderness of London there is some\nrest. Its steeples and towers and its one great dome grow more\nethereal; its smoky house-tops lose their grossness in the pale\neffulgence; the noises that arise from the streets are fewer and are\nsoftened, and the footsteps on the pavements pass more tranquilly\naway. In these fields of Mr. Tulkinghorn's inhabiting, where the\nshepherds play on Chancery pipes that have no stop, and keep their\nsheep in the fold by hook and by crook until they have shorn them\nexceeding close, every noise is merged, this moonlight night, into a\ndistant ringing hum, as if the city were a vast glass, vibrating.\n\nWhat's that? Who fired a gun or pistol? Where was it?\n\nThe few foot-passengers start, stop, and stare about them. Some\nwindows and doors are opened, and people come out to look. It was a\nloud report and echoed and rattled heavily. It shook one house, or so\na man says who was passing. It has aroused all the dogs in the\nneighbourhood, who bark vehemently. Terrified cats scamper across the\nroad. While the dogs are yet barking and howling--there is one dog\nhowling like a demon--the church-clocks, as if they were startled\ntoo, begin to strike. The hum from the streets, likewise, seems to\nswell into a shout. But it is soon over. Before the last clock begins\nto strike ten, there is a lull. When it has ceased, the fine night,\nthe bright large moon, and multitudes of stars, are left at peace\nagain.\n\nHas Mr. Tulkinghorn been disturbed? His windows are dark and quiet,\nand his door is shut. It must be something unusual indeed to bring\nhim out of his shell. Nothing is heard of him, nothing is seen of\nhim. What power of cannon might it take to shake that rusty old man\nout of his immovable composure?\n\nFor many years the persistent Roman has been pointing, with no\nparticular meaning, from that ceiling. It is not likely that he has\nany new meaning in him to-night. Once pointing, always pointing--like\nany Roman, or even Briton, with a single idea. There he is, no doubt,\nin his impossible attitude, pointing, unavailingly, all night long.\nMoonlight, darkness, dawn, sunrise, day. There he is still, eagerly\npointing, and no one minds him.\n\nBut a little after the coming of the day come people to clean the\nrooms. And either the Roman has some new meaning in him, not\nexpressed before, or the foremost of them goes wild, for looking up\nat his outstretched hand and looking down at what is below it, that\nperson shrieks and flies. The others, looking in as the first one\nlooked, shriek and fly too, and there is an alarm in the street.\n\nWhat does it mean? No light is admitted into the darkened chamber,\nand people unaccustomed to it enter, and treading softly but heavily,\ncarry a weight into the bedroom and lay it down. There is whispering\nand wondering all day, strict search of every corner, careful tracing\nof steps, and careful noting of the disposition of every article of\nfurniture. All eyes look up at the Roman, and all voices murmur, \"If\nhe could only tell what he saw!\"\n\nHe is pointing at a table with a bottle (nearly full of wine) and a\nglass upon it and two candles that were blown out suddenly soon after\nbeing lighted. He is pointing at an empty chair and at a stain upon\nthe ground before it that might be almost covered with a hand. These\nobjects lie directly within his range. An excited imagination might\nsuppose that there was something in them so terrific as to drive the\nrest of the composition, not only the attendant big-legged boys, but\nthe clouds and flowers and pillars too--in short, the very body and\nsoul of Allegory, and all the brains it has--stark mad. It happens\nsurely that every one who comes into the darkened room and looks at\nthese things looks up at the Roman and that he is invested in all\neyes with mystery and awe, as if he were a paralysed dumb witness.\n\nSo it shall happen surely, through many years to come, that ghostly\nstories shall be told of the stain upon the floor, so easy to be\ncovered, so hard to be got out, and that the Roman, pointing from the\nceiling shall point, so long as dust and damp and spiders spare him,\nwith far greater significance than he ever had in Mr. Tulkinghorn's\ntime, and with a deadly meaning. For Mr. Tulkinghorn's time is over\nfor evermore, and the Roman pointed at the murderous hand uplifted\nagainst his life, and pointed helplessly at him, from night to\nmorning, lying face downward on the floor, shot through the heart.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLIX\n\nDutiful Friendship\n\n\nA great annual occasion has come round in the establishment of Mr.\nMatthew Bagnet, otherwise Lignum Vitae, ex-artilleryman and present\nbassoon-player. An occasion of feasting and festival. The celebration\nof a birthday in the family.\n\nIt is not Mr. Bagnet's birthday. Mr. Bagnet merely distinguishes that\nepoch in the musical instrument business by kissing the children with\nan extra smack before breakfast, smoking an additional pipe after\ndinner, and wondering towards evening what his poor old mother is\nthinking about it--a subject of infinite speculation, and rendered so\nby his mother having departed this life twenty years. Some men rarely\nrevert to their father, but seem, in the bank-books of their\nremembrance, to have transferred all the stock of filial affection\ninto their mother's name. Mr. Bagnet is one of these. Perhaps his\nexalted appreciation of the merits of the old girl causes him usually\nto make the noun-substantive \"goodness\" of the feminine gender.\n\nIt is not the birthday of one of the three children. Those occasions\nare kept with some marks of distinction, but they rarely overleap the\nbounds of happy returns and a pudding. On young Woolwich's last\nbirthday, Mr. Bagnet certainly did, after observing on his growth and\ngeneral advancement, proceed, in a moment of profound reflection on\nthe changes wrought by time, to examine him in the catechism,\naccomplishing with extreme accuracy the questions number one and two,\n\"What is your name?\" and \"Who gave you that name?\" but there failing\nin the exact precision of his memory and substituting for number\nthree the question \"And how do you like that name?\" which he\npropounded with a sense of its importance, in itself so edifying and\nimproving as to give it quite an orthodox air. This, however, was a\nspeciality on that particular birthday, and not a general solemnity.\n\nIt is the old girl's birthday, and that is the greatest holiday and\nreddest-letter day in Mr. Bagnet's calendar. The auspicious event is\nalways commemorated according to certain forms settled and prescribed\nby Mr. Bagnet some years since. Mr. Bagnet, being deeply convinced\nthat to have a pair of fowls for dinner is to attain the highest\npitch of imperial luxury, invariably goes forth himself very early in\nthe morning of this day to buy a pair; he is, as invariably, taken in\nby the vendor and installed in the possession of the oldest\ninhabitants of any coop in Europe. Returning with these triumphs of\ntoughness tied up in a clean blue and white cotton handkerchief\n(essential to the arrangements), he in a casual manner invites Mrs.\nBagnet to declare at breakfast what she would like for dinner. Mrs.\nBagnet, by a coincidence never known to fail, replying fowls, Mr.\nBagnet instantly produces his bundle from a place of concealment\namidst general amazement and rejoicing. He further requires that the\nold girl shall do nothing all day long but sit in her very best gown\nand be served by himself and the young people. As he is not\nillustrious for his cookery, this may be supposed to be a matter of\nstate rather than enjoyment on the old girl's part, but she keeps her\nstate with all imaginable cheerfulness.\n\nOn this present birthday, Mr. Bagnet has accomplished the usual\npreliminaries. He has bought two specimens of poultry, which, if\nthere be any truth in adages, were certainly not caught with chaff,\nto be prepared for the spit; he has amazed and rejoiced the family by\ntheir unlooked-for production; he is himself directing the roasting\nof the poultry; and Mrs. Bagnet, with her wholesome brown fingers\nitching to prevent what she sees going wrong, sits in her gown of\nceremony, an honoured guest.\n\nQuebec and Malta lay the cloth for dinner, while Woolwich, serving,\nas beseems him, under his father, keeps the fowls revolving. To these\nyoung scullions Mrs. Bagnet occasionally imparts a wink, or a shake\nof the head, or a crooked face, as they made mistakes.\n\n\"At half after one.\" Says Mr. Bagnet. \"To the minute. They'll be\ndone.\"\n\nMrs. Bagnet, with anguish, beholds one of them at a standstill before\nthe fire and beginning to burn.\n\n\"You shall have a dinner, old girl,\" says Mr. Bagnet. \"Fit for a\nqueen.\"\n\nMrs. Bagnet shows her white teeth cheerfully, but to the perception\nof her son, betrays so much uneasiness of spirit that he is impelled\nby the dictates of affection to ask her, with his eyes, what is the\nmatter, thus standing, with his eyes wide open, more oblivious of the\nfowls than before, and not affording the least hope of a return to\nconsciousness. Fortunately his elder sister perceives the cause of\nthe agitation in Mrs. Bagnet's breast and with an admonitory poke\nrecalls him. The stopped fowls going round again, Mrs. Bagnet closes\nher eyes in the intensity of her relief.\n\n\"George will look us up,\" says Mr. Bagnet. \"At half after four. To\nthe moment. How many years, old girl. Has George looked us up. This\nafternoon?\"\n\n\"Ah, Lignum, Lignum, as many as make an old woman of a young one, I\nbegin to think. Just about that, and no less,\" returns Mrs. Bagnet,\nlaughing and shaking her head.\n\n\"Old girl,\" says Mr. Bagnet, \"never mind. You'd be as young as ever\nyou was. If you wasn't younger. Which you are. As everybody knows.\"\n\nQuebec and Malta here exclaim, with clapping of hands, that Bluffy is\nsure to bring mother something, and begin to speculate on what it\nwill be.\n\n\"Do you know, Lignum,\" says Mrs. Bagnet, casting a glance on the\ntable-cloth, and winking \"salt!\" at Malta with her right eye, and\nshaking the pepper away from Quebec with her head, \"I begin to think\nGeorge is in the roving way again.\n\n\"George,\" returns Mr. Bagnet, \"will never desert. And leave his old\ncomrade. In the lurch. Don't be afraid of it.\"\n\n\"No, Lignum. No. I don't say he will. I don't think he will. But if\nhe could get over this money trouble of his, I believe he would be\noff.\"\n\nMr. Bagnet asks why.\n\n\"Well,\" returns his wife, considering, \"George seems to me to be\ngetting not a little impatient and restless. I don't say but what\nhe's as free as ever. Of course he must be free or he wouldn't be\nGeorge, but he smarts and seems put out.\"\n\n\"He's extra-drilled,\" says Mr. Bagnet. \"By a lawyer. Who would put\nthe devil out.\"\n\n\"There's something in that,\" his wife assents; \"but so it is,\nLignum.\"\n\nFurther conversation is prevented, for the time, by the necessity\nunder which Mr. Bagnet finds himself of directing the whole force of\nhis mind to the dinner, which is a little endangered by the dry\nhumour of the fowls in not yielding any gravy, and also by the made\ngravy acquiring no flavour and turning out of a flaxen complexion.\nWith a similar perverseness, the potatoes crumble off forks in the\nprocess of peeling, upheaving from their centres in every direction,\nas if they were subject to earthquakes. The legs of the fowls, too,\nare longer than could be desired, and extremely scaly. Overcoming\nthese disadvantages to the best of his ability, Mr. Bagnet at last\ndishes and they sit down at table, Mrs. Bagnet occupying the guest's\nplace at his right hand.\n\nIt is well for the old girl that she has but one birthday in a year,\nfor two such indulgences in poultry might be injurious. Every kind of\nfiner tendon and ligament that is in the nature of poultry to possess\nis developed in these specimens in the singular form of\nguitar-strings. Their limbs appear to have struck roots into their\nbreasts and bodies, as aged trees strike roots into the earth. Their\nlegs are so hard as to encourage the idea that they must have devoted\nthe greater part of their long and arduous lives to pedestrian\nexercises and the walking of matches. But Mr. Bagnet, unconscious of\nthese little defects, sets his heart on Mrs. Bagnet eating a most\nsevere quantity of the delicacies before her; and as that good old\ngirl would not cause him a moment's disappointment on any day, least\nof all on such a day, for any consideration, she imperils her\ndigestion fearfully. How young Woolwich cleans the drum-sticks\nwithout being of ostrich descent, his anxious mother is at a loss to\nunderstand.\n\nThe old girl has another trial to undergo after the conclusion of the\nrepast in sitting in state to see the room cleared, the hearth swept,\nand the dinner-service washed up and polished in the backyard. The\ngreat delight and energy with which the two young ladies apply\nthemselves to these duties, turning up their skirts in imitation of\ntheir mother and skating in and out on little scaffolds of pattens,\ninspire the highest hopes for the future, but some anxiety for the\npresent. The same causes lead to confusion of tongues, a clattering\nof crockery, a rattling of tin mugs, a whisking of brooms, and an\nexpenditure of water, all in excess, while the saturation of the\nyoung ladies themselves is almost too moving a spectacle for Mrs.\nBagnet to look upon with the calmness proper to her position. At last\nthe various cleansing processes are triumphantly completed; Quebec\nand Malta appear in fresh attire, smiling and dry; pipes, tobacco,\nand something to drink are placed upon the table; and the old girl\nenjoys the first peace of mind she ever knows on the day of this\ndelightful entertainment.\n\nWhen Mr. Bagnet takes his usual seat, the hands of the clock are very\nnear to half-past four; as they mark it accurately, Mr. Bagnet\nannounces, \"George! Military time.\"\n\nIt is George, and he has hearty congratulations for the old girl\n(whom he kisses on the great occasion), and for the children, and for\nMr. Bagnet. \"Happy returns to all!\" says Mr. George.\n\n\"But, George, old man!\" cries Mrs. Bagnet, looking at him curiously.\n\"What's come to you?\"\n\n\"Come to me?\"\n\n\"Ah! You are so white, George--for you--and look so shocked. Now\ndon't he, Lignum?\"\n\n\"George,\" says Mr. Bagnet, \"tell the old girl. What's the matter.\"\n\n\"I didn't know I looked white,\" says the trooper, passing his hand\nover his brow, \"and I didn't know I looked shocked, and I'm sorry I\ndo. But the truth is, that boy who was taken in at my place died\nyesterday afternoon, and it has rather knocked me over.\"\n\n\"Poor creetur!\" says Mrs. Bagnet with a mother's pity. \"Is he gone?\nDear, dear!\"\n\n\"I didn't mean to say anything about it, for it's not birthday talk,\nbut you have got it out of me, you see, before I sit down. I should\nhave roused up in a minute,\" says the trooper, making himself speak\nmore gaily, \"but you're so quick, Mrs. Bagnet.\"\n\n\"You're right. The old girl,\" says Mr. Bagnet. \"Is as quick. As\npowder.\"\n\n\"And what's more, she's the subject of the day, and we'll stick to\nher,\" cries Mr. George. \"See here, I have brought a little brooch\nalong with me. It's a poor thing, you know, but it's a keepsake.\nThat's all the good it is, Mrs. Bagnet.\"\n\nMr. George produces his present, which is greeted with admiring\nleapings and clappings by the young family, and with a species of\nreverential admiration by Mr. Bagnet. \"Old girl,\" says Mr. Bagnet.\n\"Tell him my opinion of it.\"\n\n\"Why, it's a wonder, George!\" Mrs. Bagnet exclaims. \"It's the\nbeautifullest thing that ever was seen!\"\n\n\"Good!\" says Mr. Bagnet. \"My opinion.\"\n\n\"It's so pretty, George,\" cries Mrs. Bagnet, turning it on all sides\nand holding it out at arm's length, \"that it seems too choice for\nme.\"\n\n\"Bad!\" says Mr. Bagnet. \"Not my opinion.\"\n\n\"But whatever it is, a hundred thousand thanks, old fellow,\" says\nMrs. Bagnet, her eyes sparkling with pleasure and her hand stretched\nout to him; \"and though I have been a crossgrained soldier's wife to\nyou sometimes, George, we are as strong friends, I am sure, in\nreality, as ever can be. Now you shall fasten it on yourself, for\ngood luck, if you will, George.\"\n\nThe children close up to see it done, and Mr. Bagnet looks over young\nWoolwich's head to see it done with an interest so maturely wooden,\nyet pleasantly childish, that Mrs. Bagnet cannot help laughing in her\nairy way and saying, \"Oh, Lignum, Lignum, what a precious old chap\nyou are!\" But the trooper fails to fasten the brooch. His hand\nshakes, he is nervous, and it falls off. \"Would any one believe\nthis?\" says he, catching it as it drops and looking round. \"I am so\nout of sorts that I bungle at an easy job like this!\"\n\nMrs. Bagnet concludes that for such a case there is no remedy like a\npipe, and fastening the brooch herself in a twinkling, causes the\ntrooper to be inducted into his usual snug place and the pipes to be\ngot into action. \"If that don't bring you round, George,\" says she,\n\"just throw your eye across here at your present now and then, and\nthe two together MUST do it.\"\n\n\"You ought to do it of yourself,\" George answers; \"I know that very\nwell, Mrs. Bagnet. I'll tell you how, one way and another, the blues\nhave got to be too many for me. Here was this poor lad. 'Twas dull\nwork to see him dying as he did, and not be able to help him.\"\n\n\"What do you mean, George? You did help him. You took him under your\nroof.\"\n\n\"I helped him so far, but that's little. I mean, Mrs. Bagnet, there\nhe was, dying without ever having been taught much more than to know\nhis right hand from his left. And he was too far gone to be helped\nout of that.\"\n\n\"Ah, poor creetur!\" says Mrs. Bagnet.\n\n\"Then,\" says the trooper, not yet lighting his pipe, and passing his\nheavy hand over his hair, \"that brought up Gridley in a man's mind.\nHis was a bad case too, in a different way. Then the two got mixed up\nin a man's mind with a flinty old rascal who had to do with both. And\nto think of that rusty carbine, stock and barrel, standing up on end\nin his corner, hard, indifferent, taking everything so evenly--it\nmade flesh and blood tingle, I do assure you.\"\n\n\"My advice to you,\" returns Mrs. Bagnet, \"is to light your pipe and\ntingle that way. It's wholesomer and comfortabler, and better for the\nhealth altogether.\"\n\n\"You're right,\" says the trooper, \"and I'll do it.\"\n\nSo he does it, though still with an indignant gravity that impresses\nthe young Bagnets, and even causes Mr. Bagnet to defer the ceremony\nof drinking Mrs. Bagnet's health, always given by himself on these\noccasions in a speech of exemplary terseness. But the young ladies\nhaving composed what Mr. Bagnet is in the habit of calling \"the\nmixtur,\" and George's pipe being now in a glow, Mr. Bagnet considers\nit his duty to proceed to the toast of the evening. He addresses the\nassembled company in the following terms.\n\n\"George. Woolwich. Quebec. Malta. This is her birthday. Take a day's\nmarch. And you won't find such another. Here's towards her!\"\n\nThe toast having been drunk with enthusiasm, Mrs. Bagnet returns\nthanks in a neat address of corresponding brevity. This model\ncomposition is limited to the three words \"And wishing yours!\" which\nthe old girl follows up with a nod at everybody in succession and a\nwell-regulated swig of the mixture. This she again follows up, on the\npresent occasion, by the wholly unexpected exclamation, \"Here's a\nman!\"\n\nHere IS a man, much to the astonishment of the little company,\nlooking in at the parlour-door. He is a sharp-eyed man--a quick keen\nman--and he takes in everybody's look at him, all at once,\nindividually and collectively, in a manner that stamps him a\nremarkable man.\n\n\"George,\" says the man, nodding, \"how do you find yourself?\"\n\n\"Why, it's Bucket!\" cries Mr. George.\n\n\"Yes,\" says the man, coming in and closing the door. \"I was going\ndown the street here when I happened to stop and look in at the\nmusical instruments in the shop-window--a friend of mine is in want\nof a second-hand wiolinceller of a good tone--and I saw a party\nenjoying themselves, and I thought it was you in the corner; I\nthought I couldn't be mistaken. How goes the world with you, George,\nat the present moment? Pretty smooth? And with you, ma'am? And with\nyou, governor? And Lord,\" says Mr. Bucket, opening his arms, \"here's\nchildren too! You may do anything with me if you only show me\nchildren. Give us a kiss, my pets. No occasion to inquire who YOUR\nfather and mother is. Never saw such a likeness in my life!\"\n\nMr. Bucket, not unwelcome, has sat himself down next to Mr. George\nand taken Quebec and Malta on his knees. \"You pretty dears,\" says Mr.\nBucket, \"give us another kiss; it's the only thing I'm greedy in.\nLord bless you, how healthy you look! And what may be the ages of\nthese two, ma'am? I should put 'em down at the figures of about eight\nand ten.\"\n\n\"You're very near, sir,\" says Mrs. Bagnet.\n\n\"I generally am near,\" returns Mr. Bucket, \"being so fond of\nchildren. A friend of mine has had nineteen of 'em, ma'am, all by one\nmother, and she's still as fresh and rosy as the morning. Not so much\nso as yourself, but, upon my soul, she comes near you! And what do\nyou call these, my darling?\" pursues Mr. Bucket, pinching Malta's\ncheeks. \"These are peaches, these are. Bless your heart! And what do\nyou think about father? Do you think father could recommend a\nsecond-hand wiolinceller of a good tone for Mr. Bucket's friend, my\ndear? My name's Bucket. Ain't that a funny name?\"\n\nThese blandishments have entirely won the family heart. Mrs. Bagnet\nforgets the day to the extent of filling a pipe and a glass for Mr.\nBucket and waiting upon him hospitably. She would be glad to receive\nso pleasant a character under any circumstances, but she tells him\nthat as a friend of George's she is particularly glad to see him this\nevening, for George has not been in his usual spirits.\n\n\"Not in his usual spirits?\" exclaims Mr. Bucket. \"Why, I never heard\nof such a thing! What's the matter, George? You don't intend to tell\nme you've been out of spirits. What should you be out of spirits for?\nYou haven't got anything on your mind, you know.\"\n\n\"Nothing particular,\" returns the trooper.\n\n\"I should think not,\" rejoins Mr. Bucket. \"What could you have on\nyour mind, you know! And have these pets got anything on THEIR minds,\neh? Not they, but they'll be upon the minds of some of the young\nfellows, some of these days, and make 'em precious low-spirited. I\nain't much of a prophet, but I can tell you that, ma'am.\"\n\nMrs. Bagnet, quite charmed, hopes Mr. Bucket has a family of his own.\n\n\"There, ma'am!\" says Mr. Bucket. \"Would you believe it? No, I\nhaven't. My wife and a lodger constitute my family. Mrs. Bucket is as\nfond of children as myself and as wishful to have 'em, but no. So it\nis. Worldly goods are divided unequally, and man must not repine.\nWhat a very nice backyard, ma'am! Any way out of that yard, now?\"\n\nThere is no way out of that yard.\n\n\"Ain't there really?\" says Mr. Bucket. \"I should have thought there\nmight have been. Well, I don't know as I ever saw a backyard that\ntook my fancy more. Would you allow me to look at it? Thank you. No,\nI see there's no way out. But what a very good-proportioned yard it\nis!\"\n\nHaving cast his sharp eye all about it, Mr. Bucket returns to his\nchair next his friend Mr. George and pats Mr. George affectionately\non the shoulder.\n\n\"How are your spirits now, George?\"\n\n\"All right now,\" returns the trooper.\n\n\"That's your sort!\" says Mr. Bucket. \"Why should you ever have been\notherwise? A man of your fine figure and constitution has no right to\nbe out of spirits. That ain't a chest to be out of spirits, is it,\nma'am? And you haven't got anything on your mind, you know, George;\nwhat could you have on your mind!\"\n\nSomewhat harping on this phrase, considering the extent and variety\nof his conversational powers, Mr. Bucket twice or thrice repeats it\nto the pipe he lights, and with a listening face that is particularly\nhis own. But the sun of his sociality soon recovers from this brief\neclipse and shines again.\n\n\"And this is brother, is it, my dears?\" says Mr. Bucket, referring to\nQuebec and Malta for information on the subject of young Woolwich.\n\"And a nice brother he is--half-brother I mean to say. For he's too\nold to be your boy, ma'am.\"\n\n\"I can certify at all events that he is not anybody else's,\" returns\nMrs. Bagnet, laughing.\n\n\"Well, you do surprise me! Yet he's like you, there's no denying.\nLord, he's wonderfully like you! But about what you may call the\nbrow, you know, THERE his father comes out!\" Mr. Bucket compares the\nfaces with one eye shut up, while Mr. Bagnet smokes in stolid\nsatisfaction.\n\nThis is an opportunity for Mrs. Bagnet to inform him that the boy is\nGeorge's godson.\n\n\"George's godson, is he?\" rejoins Mr. Bucket with extreme cordiality.\n\"I must shake hands over again with George's godson. Godfather and\ngodson do credit to one another. And what do you intend to make of\nhim, ma'am? Does he show any turn for any musical instrument?\"\n\nMr. Bagnet suddenly interposes, \"Plays the fife. Beautiful.\"\n\n\"Would you believe it, governor,\" says Mr. Bucket, struck by the\ncoincidence, \"that when I was a boy I played the fife myself? Not in\na scientific way, as I expect he does, but by ear. Lord bless you!\n'British Grenadiers'--there's a tune to warm an Englishman up! COULD\nyou give us 'British Grenadiers,' my fine fellow?\"\n\nNothing could be more acceptable to the little circle than this call\nupon young Woolwich, who immediately fetches his fife and performs\nthe stirring melody, during which performance Mr. Bucket, much\nenlivened, beats time and never fails to come in sharp with the\nburden, \"British Gra-a-anadeers!\" In short, he shows so much musical\ntaste that Mr. Bagnet actually takes his pipe from his lips to\nexpress his conviction that he is a singer. Mr. Bucket receives the\nharmonious impeachment so modestly, confessing how that he did once\nchaunt a little, for the expression of the feelings of his own bosom,\nand with no presumptuous idea of entertaining his friends, that he is\nasked to sing. Not to be behindhand in the sociality of the evening,\nhe complies and gives them \"Believe Me, if All Those Endearing Young\nCharms.\" This ballad, he informs Mrs. Bagnet, he considers to have\nbeen his most powerful ally in moving the heart of Mrs. Bucket when a\nmaiden, and inducing her to approach the altar--Mr. Bucket's own\nwords are \"to come up to the scratch.\"\n\nThis sparkling stranger is such a new and agreeable feature in the\nevening that Mr. George, who testified no great emotions of pleasure\non his entrance, begins, in spite of himself, to be rather proud of\nhim. He is so friendly, is a man of so many resources, and so easy to\nget on with, that it is something to have made him known there. Mr.\nBagnet becomes, after another pipe, so sensible of the value of his\nacquaintance that he solicits the honour of his company on the old\ngirl's next birthday. If anything can more closely cement and\nconsolidate the esteem which Mr. Bucket has formed for the family, it\nis the discovery of the nature of the occasion. He drinks to Mrs.\nBagnet with a warmth approaching to rapture, engages himself for that\nday twelvemonth more than thankfully, makes a memorandum of the day\nin a large black pocket-book with a girdle to it, and breathes a hope\nthat Mrs. Bucket and Mrs. Bagnet may before then become, in a manner,\nsisters. As he says himself, what is public life without private\nties? He is in his humble way a public man, but it is not in that\nsphere that he finds happiness. No, it must be sought within the\nconfines of domestic bliss.\n\nIt is natural, under these circumstances, that he, in his turn,\nshould remember the friend to whom he is indebted for so promising an\nacquaintance. And he does. He keeps very close to him. Whatever the\nsubject of the conversation, he keeps a tender eye upon him. He waits\nto walk home with him. He is interested in his very boots and\nobserves even them attentively as Mr. George sits smoking\ncross-legged in the chimney-corner.\n\nAt length Mr. George rises to depart. At the same moment Mr. Bucket,\nwith the secret sympathy of friendship, also rises. He dotes upon the\nchildren to the last and remembers the commission he has undertaken\nfor an absent friend.\n\n\"Respecting that second-hand wiolinceller, governor--could you\nrecommend me such a thing?\"\n\n\"Scores,\" says Mr. Bagnet.\n\n\"I am obliged to you,\" returns Mr. Bucket, squeezing his hand.\n\"You're a friend in need. A good tone, mind you! My friend is a\nregular dab at it. Ecod, he saws away at Mozart and Handel and the\nrest of the big-wigs like a thorough workman. And you needn't,\" says\nMr. Bucket in a considerate and private voice, \"you needn't commit\nyourself to too low a figure, governor. I don't want to pay too large\na price for my friend, but I want you to have your proper percentage\nand be remunerated for your loss of time. That is but fair. Every man\nmust live, and ought to it.\"\n\nMr. Bagnet shakes his head at the old girl to the effect that they\nhave found a jewel of price.\n\n\"Suppose I was to give you a look in, say, at half arter ten\nto-morrow morning. Perhaps you could name the figures of a few\nwiolincellers of a good tone?\" says Mr. Bucket.\n\nNothing easier. Mr. and Mrs. Bagnet both engage to have the requisite\ninformation ready and even hint to each other at the practicability\nof having a small stock collected there for approval.\n\n\"Thank you,\" says Mr. Bucket, \"thank you. Good night, ma'am. Good\nnight, governor. Good night, darlings. I am much obliged to you for\none of the pleasantest evenings I ever spent in my life.\"\n\nThey, on the contrary, are much obliged to him for the pleasure he\nhas given them in his company; and so they part with many expressions\nof goodwill on both sides. \"Now George, old boy,\" says Mr. Bucket,\ntaking his arm at the shop-door, \"come along!\" As they go down the\nlittle street and the Bagnets pause for a minute looking after them,\nMrs. Bagnet remarks to the worthy Lignum that Mr. Bucket \"almost\nclings to George like, and seems to be really fond of him.\"\n\nThe neighbouring streets being narrow and ill-paved, it is a little\ninconvenient to walk there two abreast and arm in arm. Mr. George\ntherefore soon proposes to walk singly. But Mr. Bucket, who cannot\nmake up his mind to relinquish his friendly hold, replies, \"Wait half\na minute, George. I should wish to speak to you first.\" Immediately\nafterwards, he twists him into a public-house and into a parlour,\nwhere he confronts him and claps his own back against the door.\n\n\"Now, George,\" says Mr. Bucket, \"duty is duty, and friendship is\nfriendship. I never want the two to clash if I can help it. I have\nendeavoured to make things pleasant to-night, and I put it to you\nwhether I have done it or not. You must consider yourself in custody,\nGeorge.\"\n\n\"Custody? What for?\" returns the trooper, thunderstruck.\n\n\"Now, George,\" says Mr. Bucket, urging a sensible view of the case\nupon him with his fat forefinger, \"duty, as you know very well, is\none thing, and conversation is another. It's my duty to inform you\nthat any observations you may make will be liable to be used against\nyou. Therefore, George, be careful what you say. You don't happen to\nhave heard of a murder?\"\n\n\"Murder!\"\n\n\"Now, George,\" says Mr. Bucket, keeping his forefinger in an\nimpressive state of action, \"bear in mind what I've said to you. I\nask you nothing. You've been in low spirits this afternoon. I say,\nyou don't happen to have heard of a murder?\"\n\n\"No. Where has there been a murder?\"\n\n\"Now, George,\" says Mr. Bucket, \"don't you go and commit yourself.\nI'm a-going to tell you what I want you for. There has been a murder\nin Lincoln's Inn Fields--gentleman of the name of Tulkinghorn. He was\nshot last night. I want you for that.\"\n\nThe trooper sinks upon a seat behind him, and great drops start out\nupon his forehead, and a deadly pallor overspreads his face.\n\n\"Bucket! It's not possible that Mr. Tulkinghorn has been killed and\nthat you suspect ME?\"\n\n\"George,\" returns Mr. Bucket, keeping his forefinger going, \"it is\ncertainly possible, because it's the case. This deed was done last\nnight at ten o'clock. Now, you know where you were last night at ten\no'clock, and you'll be able to prove it, no doubt.\"\n\n\"Last night! Last night?\" repeats the trooper thoughtfully. Then it\nflashes upon him. \"Why, great heaven, I was there last night!\"\n\n\"So I have understood, George,\" returns Mr. Bucket with great\ndeliberation. \"So I have understood. Likewise you've been very often\nthere. You've been seen hanging about the place, and you've been\nheard more than once in a wrangle with him, and it's possible--I\ndon't say it's certainly so, mind you, but it's possible--that he may\nhave been heard to call you a threatening, murdering, dangerous\nfellow.\"\n\nThe trooper gasps as if he would admit it all if he could speak.\n\n\"Now, George,\" continues Mr. Bucket, putting his hat upon the table\nwith an air of business rather in the upholstery way than otherwise,\n\"my wish is, as it has been all the evening, to make things pleasant.\nI tell you plainly there's a reward out, of a hundred guineas,\noffered by Sir Leicester Dedlock, Baronet. You and me have always\nbeen pleasant together; but I have got a duty to discharge; and if\nthat hundred guineas is to be made, it may as well be made by me as\nany other man. On all of which accounts, I should hope it was clear\nto you that I must have you, and that I'm damned if I don't have you.\nAm I to call in any assistance, or is the trick done?\"\n\nMr. George has recovered himself and stands up like a soldier.\n\"Come,\" he says; \"I am ready.\"\n\n\"George,\" continues Mr. Bucket, \"wait a bit!\" With his upholsterer\nmanner, as if the trooper were a window to be fitted up, he takes\nfrom his pocket a pair of handcuffs. \"This is a serious charge,\nGeorge, and such is my duty.\"\n\nThe trooper flushes angrily and hesitates a moment, but holds out his\ntwo hands, clasped together, and says, \"There! Put them on!\"\n\nMr. Bucket adjusts them in a moment. \"How do you find them? Are they\ncomfortable? If not, say so, for I wish to make things as pleasant as\nis consistent with my duty, and I've got another pair in my pocket.\"\nThis remark he offers like a most respectable tradesman anxious to\nexecute an order neatly and to the perfect satisfaction of his\ncustomer. \"They'll do as they are? Very well! Now, you see,\nGeorge\"--he takes a cloak from a corner and begins adjusting it about\nthe trooper's neck--\"I was mindful of your feelings when I come out,\nand brought this on purpose. There! Who's the wiser?\"\n\n\"Only I,\" returns the trooper, \"but as I know it, do me one more good\nturn and pull my hat over my eyes.\"\n\n\"Really, though! Do you mean it? Ain't it a pity? It looks so.\"\n\n\"I can't look chance men in the face with these things on,\" Mr.\nGeorge hurriedly replies. \"Do, for God's sake, pull my hat forward.\"\n\nSo strongly entreated, Mr. Bucket complies, puts his own hat on, and\nconducts his prize into the streets, the trooper marching on as\nsteadily as usual, though with his head less erect, and Mr. Bucket\nsteering him with his elbow over the crossings and up the turnings.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER L\n\nEsther's Narrative\n\n\nIt happened that when I came home from Deal I found a note from Caddy\nJellyby (as we always continued to call her), informing me that her\nhealth, which had been for some time very delicate, was worse and\nthat she would be more glad than she could tell me if I would go to\nsee her. It was a note of a few lines, written from the couch on\nwhich she lay and enclosed to me in another from her husband, in\nwhich he seconded her entreaty with much solicitude. Caddy was now\nthe mother, and I the godmother, of such a poor little baby--such a\ntiny old-faced mite, with a countenance that seemed to be scarcely\nanything but cap-border, and a little lean, long-fingered hand,\nalways clenched under its chin. It would lie in this attitude all\nday, with its bright specks of eyes open, wondering (as I used to\nimagine) how it came to be so small and weak. Whenever it was moved\nit cried, but at all other times it was so patient that the sole\ndesire of its life appeared to be to lie quiet and think. It had\ncurious little dark veins in its face and curious little dark marks\nunder its eyes like faint remembrances of poor Caddy's inky days, and\naltogether, to those who were not used to it, it was quite a piteous\nlittle sight.\n\nBut it was enough for Caddy that SHE was used to it. The projects\nwith which she beguiled her illness, for little Esther's education,\nand little Esther's marriage, and even for her own old age as the\ngrandmother of little Esther's little Esthers, was so prettily\nexpressive of devotion to this pride of her life that I should be\ntempted to recall some of them but for the timely remembrance that I\nam getting on irregularly as it is.\n\nTo return to the letter. Caddy had a superstition about me which had\nbeen strengthening in her mind ever since that night long ago when\nshe had lain asleep with her head in my lap. She almost--I think I\nmust say quite--believed that I did her good whenever I was near her.\nNow although this was such a fancy of the affectionate girl's that I\nam almost ashamed to mention it, still it might have all the force of\na fact when she was really ill. Therefore I set off to Caddy, with my\nguardian's consent, post-haste; and she and Prince made so much of me\nthat there never was anything like it.\n\nNext day I went again to sit with her, and next day I went again. It\nwas a very easy journey, for I had only to rise a little earlier in\nthe morning, and keep my accounts, and attend to housekeeping matters\nbefore leaving home.\n\nBut when I had made these three visits, my guardian said to me, on my\nreturn at night, \"Now, little woman, little woman, this will never\ndo. Constant dropping will wear away a stone, and constant coaching\nwill wear out a Dame Durden. We will go to London for a while and\ntake possession of our old lodgings.\"\n\n\"Not for me, dear guardian,\" said I, \"for I never feel tired,\" which\nwas strictly true. I was only too happy to be in such request.\n\n\"For me then,\" returned my guardian, \"or for Ada, or for both of us.\nIt is somebody's birthday to-morrow, I think.\"\n\n\"Truly I think it is,\" said I, kissing my darling, who would be\ntwenty-one to-morrow.\n\n\"Well,\" observed my guardian, half pleasantly, half seriously,\n\"that's a great occasion and will give my fair cousin some necessary\nbusiness to transact in assertion of her independence, and will make\nLondon a more convenient place for all of us. So to London we will\ngo. That being settled, there is another thing--how have you left\nCaddy?\"\n\n\"Very unwell, guardian. I fear it will be some time before she\nregains her health and strength.\"\n\n\"What do you call some time, now?\" asked my guardian thoughtfully.\n\n\"Some weeks, I am afraid.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" He began to walk about the room with his hands in his pockets,\nshowing that he had been thinking as much. \"Now, what do you say\nabout her doctor? Is he a good doctor, my love?\"\n\nI felt obliged to confess that I knew nothing to the contrary but\nthat Prince and I had agreed only that evening that we would like his\nopinion to be confirmed by some one.\n\n\"Well, you know,\" returned my guardian quickly, \"there's Woodcourt.\"\n\nI had not meant that, and was rather taken by surprise. For a moment\nall that I had had in my mind in connexion with Mr. Woodcourt seemed\nto come back and confuse me.\n\n\"You don't object to him, little woman?\"\n\n\"Object to him, guardian? Oh no!\"\n\n\"And you don't think the patient would object to him?\"\n\nSo far from that, I had no doubt of her being prepared to have a\ngreat reliance on him and to like him very much. I said that he was\nno stranger to her personally, for she had seen him often in his kind\nattendance on Miss Flite.\n\n\"Very good,\" said my guardian. \"He has been here to-day, my dear, and\nI will see him about it to-morrow.\"\n\nI felt in this short conversation--though I did not know how, for she\nwas quiet, and we interchanged no look--that my dear girl well\nremembered how merrily she had clasped me round the waist when no\nother hands than Caddy's had brought me the little parting token.\nThis caused me to feel that I ought to tell her, and Caddy too, that\nI was going to be the mistress of Bleak House and that if I avoided\nthat disclosure any longer I might become less worthy in my own eyes\nof its master's love. Therefore, when we went upstairs and had waited\nlistening until the clock struck twelve in order that only I might be\nthe first to wish my darling all good wishes on her birthday and to\ntake her to my heart, I set before her, just as I had set before\nmyself, the goodness and honour of her cousin John and the happy life\nthat was in store for me. If ever my darling were fonder of me at\none time than another in all our intercourse, she was surely fondest\nof me that night. And I was so rejoiced to know it and so comforted\nby the sense of having done right in casting this last idle\nreservation away that I was ten times happier than I had been before.\nI had scarcely thought it a reservation a few hours ago, but now that\nit was gone I felt as if I understood its nature better.\n\nNext day we went to London. We found our old lodging vacant, and in\nhalf an hour were quietly established there, as if we had never gone\naway. Mr. Woodcourt dined with us to celebrate my darling's birthday,\nand we were as pleasant as we could be with the great blank among us\nthat Richard's absence naturally made on such an occasion. After that\nday I was for some weeks--eight or nine as I remember--very much with\nCaddy, and thus it fell out that I saw less of Ada at this time than\nany other since we had first come together, except the time of my own\nillness. She often came to Caddy's, but our function there was to\namuse and cheer her, and we did not talk in our usual confidential\nmanner. Whenever I went home at night we were together, but Caddy's\nrest was broken by pain, and I often remained to nurse her.\n\nWith her husband and her poor little mite of a baby to love and their\nhome to strive for, what a good creature Caddy was! So self-denying,\nso uncomplaining, so anxious to get well on their account, so afraid\nof giving trouble, and so thoughtful of the unassisted labours of her\nhusband and the comforts of old Mr. Turveydrop; I had never known the\nbest of her until now. And it seemed so curious that her pale face\nand helpless figure should be lying there day after day where dancing\nwas the business of life, where the kit and the apprentices began\nearly every morning in the ball-room, and where the untidy little boy\nwaltzed by himself in the kitchen all the afternoon.\n\nAt Caddy's request I took the supreme direction of her apartment,\ntrimmed it up, and pushed her, couch and all, into a lighter and more\nairy and more cheerful corner than she had yet occupied; then, every\nday, when we were in our neatest array, I used to lay my small small\nnamesake in her arms and sit down to chat or work or read to her. It\nwas at one of the first of these quiet times that I told Caddy about\nBleak House.\n\nWe had other visitors besides Ada. First of all we had Prince, who in\nhis hurried intervals of teaching used to come softly in and sit\nsoftly down, with a face of loving anxiety for Caddy and the very\nlittle child. Whatever Caddy's condition really was, she never failed\nto declare to Prince that she was all but well--which I, heaven\nforgive me, never failed to confirm. This would put Prince in such\ngood spirits that he would sometimes take the kit from his pocket and\nplay a chord or two to astonish the baby, which I never knew it to do\nin the least degree, for my tiny namesake never noticed it at all.\n\nThen there was Mrs. Jellyby. She would come occasionally, with her\nusual distraught manner, and sit calmly looking miles beyond her\ngrandchild as if her attention were absorbed by a young Borrioboolan\non its native shores. As bright-eyed as ever, as serene, and as\nuntidy, she would say, \"Well, Caddy, child, and how do you do\nto-day?\" And then would sit amiably smiling and taking no notice of\nthe reply or would sweetly glide off into a calculation of the number\nof letters she had lately received and answered or of the\ncoffee-bearing power of Borrioboola-Gha. This she would always do\nwith a serene contempt for our limited sphere of action, not to be\ndisguised.\n\nThen there was old Mr. Turveydrop, who was from morning to night and\nfrom night to morning the subject of innumerable precautions. If the\nbaby cried, it was nearly stifled lest the noise should make him\nuncomfortable. If the fire wanted stirring in the night, it was\nsurreptitiously done lest his rest should be broken. If Caddy\nrequired any little comfort that the house contained, she first\ncarefully discussed whether he was likely to require it too. In\nreturn for this consideration he would come into the room once a day,\nall but blessing it--showing a condescension, and a patronage, and a\ngrace of manner in dispensing the light of his high-shouldered\npresence from which I might have supposed him (if I had not known\nbetter) to have been the benefactor of Caddy's life.\n\n\"My Caroline,\" he would say, making the nearest approach that he\ncould to bending over her. \"Tell me that you are better to-day.\"\n\n\"Oh, much better, thank you, Mr. Turveydrop,\" Caddy would reply.\n\n\"Delighted! Enchanted! And our dear Miss Summerson. She is not quite\nprostrated by fatigue?\" Here he would crease up his eyelids and kiss\nhis fingers to me, though I am happy to say he had ceased to be\nparticular in his attentions since I had been so altered.\n\n\"Not at all,\" I would assure him.\n\n\"Charming! We must take care of our dear Caroline, Miss Summerson. We\nmust spare nothing that will restore her. We must nourish her. My\ndear Caroline\"--he would turn to his daughter-in-law with infinite\ngenerosity and protection--\"want for nothing, my love. Frame a wish\nand gratify it, my daughter. Everything this house contains,\neverything my room contains, is at your service, my dear. Do not,\" he\nwould sometimes add in a burst of deportment, \"even allow my simple\nrequirements to be considered if they should at any time interfere\nwith your own, my Caroline. Your necessities are greater than mine.\"\n\nHe had established such a long prescriptive right to this deportment\n(his son's inheritance from his mother) that I several times knew\nboth Caddy and her husband to be melted to tears by these\naffectionate self-sacrifices.\n\n\"Nay, my dears,\" he would remonstrate; and when I saw Caddy's thin\narm about his fat neck as he said it, I would be melted too, though\nnot by the same process. \"Nay, nay! I have promised never to leave\nye. Be dutiful and affectionate towards me, and I ask no other\nreturn. Now, bless ye! I am going to the Park.\"\n\nHe would take the air there presently and get an appetite for his\nhotel dinner. I hope I do old Mr. Turveydrop no wrong, but I never\nsaw any better traits in him than these I faithfully record, except\nthat he certainly conceived a liking for Peepy and would take the\nchild out walking with great pomp, always on those occasions sending\nhim home before he went to dinner himself, and occasionally with a\nhalfpenny in his pocket. But even this disinterestedness was attended\nwith no inconsiderable cost, to my knowledge, for before Peepy was\nsufficiently decorated to walk hand in hand with the professor of\ndeportment, he had to be newly dressed, at the expense of Caddy and\nher husband, from top to toe.\n\nLast of our visitors, there was Mr. Jellyby. Really when he used to\ncome in of an evening, and ask Caddy in his meek voice how she was,\nand then sit down with his head against the wall, and make no attempt\nto say anything more, I liked him very much. If he found me bustling\nabout doing any little thing, he sometimes half took his coat off, as\nif with an intention of helping by a great exertion; but he never got\nany further. His sole occupation was to sit with his head against the\nwall, looking hard at the thoughtful baby; and I could not quite\ndivest my mind of a fancy that they understood one another.\n\nI have not counted Mr. Woodcourt among our visitors because he was\nnow Caddy's regular attendant. She soon began to improve under his\ncare, but he was so gentle, so skilful, so unwearying in the pains he\ntook that it is not to be wondered at, I am sure. I saw a good deal\nof Mr. Woodcourt during this time, though not so much as might be\nsupposed, for knowing Caddy to be safe in his hands, I often slipped\nhome at about the hours when he was expected. We frequently met,\nnotwithstanding. I was quite reconciled to myself now, but I still\nfelt glad to think that he was sorry for me, and he still WAS sorry\nfor me I believed. He helped Mr. Badger in his professional\nengagements, which were numerous, and had as yet no settled projects\nfor the future.\n\nIt was when Caddy began to recover that I began to notice a change in\nmy dear girl. I cannot say how it first presented itself to me,\nbecause I observed it in many slight particulars which were nothing\nin themselves and only became something when they were pieced\ntogether. But I made it out, by putting them together, that Ada was\nnot so frankly cheerful with me as she used to be. Her tenderness for\nme was as loving and true as ever; I did not for a moment doubt that;\nbut there was a quiet sorrow about her which she did not confide to\nme, and in which I traced some hidden regret.\n\nNow, I could not understand this, and I was so anxious for the\nhappiness of my own pet that it caused me some uneasiness and set me\nthinking often. At length, feeling sure that Ada suppressed this\nsomething from me lest it should make me unhappy too, it came into my\nhead that she was a little grieved--for me--by what I had told her\nabout Bleak House.\n\nHow I persuaded myself that this was likely, I don't know. I had no\nidea that there was any selfish reference in my doing so. I was not\ngrieved for myself: I was quite contented and quite happy. Still,\nthat Ada might be thinking--for me, though I had abandoned all such\nthoughts--of what once was, but was now all changed, seemed so easy\nto believe that I believed it.\n\nWhat could I do to reassure my darling (I considered then) and show\nher that I had no such feelings? Well! I could only be as brisk and\nbusy as possible, and that I had tried to be all along. However, as\nCaddy's illness had certainly interfered, more or less, with my home\nduties--though I had always been there in the morning to make my\nguardian's breakfast, and he had a hundred times laughed and said\nthere must be two little women, for his little woman was never\nmissing--I resolved to be doubly diligent and gay. So I went about\nthe house humming all the tunes I knew, and I sat working and working\nin a desperate manner, and I talked and talked, morning, noon, and\nnight.\n\nAnd still there was the same shade between me and my darling.\n\n\"So, Dame Trot,\" observed my guardian, shutting up his book one night\nwhen we were all three together, \"so Woodcourt has restored Caddy\nJellyby to the full enjoyment of life again?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" I said; \"and to be repaid by such gratitude as hers is to be\nmade rich, guardian.\"\n\n\"I wish it was,\" he returned, \"with all my heart.\"\n\nSo did I too, for that matter. I said so.\n\n\"Aye! We would make him as rich as a Jew if we knew how. Would we\nnot, little woman?\"\n\nI laughed as I worked and replied that I was not sure about that, for\nit might spoil him, and he might not be so useful, and there might be\nmany who could ill spare him. As Miss Flite, and Caddy herself, and\nmany others.\n\n\"True,\" said my guardian. \"I had forgotten that. But we would agree\nto make him rich enough to live, I suppose? Rich enough to work with\ntolerable peace of mind? Rich enough to have his own happy home and\nhis own household gods--and household goddess, too, perhaps?\"\n\nThat was quite another thing, I said. We must all agree in that.\n\n\"To be sure,\" said my guardian. \"All of us. I have a great regard for\nWoodcourt, a high esteem for him; and I have been sounding him\ndelicately about his plans. It is difficult to offer aid to an\nindependent man with that just kind of pride which he possesses. And\nyet I would be glad to do it if I might or if I knew how. He seems\nhalf inclined for another voyage. But that appears like casting such\na man away.\"\n\n\"It might open a new world to him,\" said I.\n\n\"So it might, little woman,\" my guardian assented. \"I doubt if he\nexpects much of the old world. Do you know I have fancied that he\nsometimes feels some particular disappointment or misfortune\nencountered in it. You never heard of anything of that sort?\"\n\nI shook my head.\n\n\"Humph,\" said my guardian. \"I am mistaken, I dare say.\" As there was\na little pause here, which I thought, for my dear girl's\nsatisfaction, had better be filled up, I hummed an air as I worked\nwhich was a favourite with my guardian.\n\n\"And do you think Mr. Woodcourt will make another voyage?\" I asked\nhim when I had hummed it quietly all through.\n\n\"I don't quite know what to think, my dear, but I should say it was\nlikely at present that he will give a long trip to another country.\"\n\n\"I am sure he will take the best wishes of all our hearts with him\nwherever he goes,\" said I; \"and though they are not riches, he will\nnever be the poorer for them, guardian, at least.\"\n\n\"Never, little woman,\" he replied.\n\nI was sitting in my usual place, which was now beside my guardian's\nchair. That had not been my usual place before the letter, but it was\nnow. I looked up to Ada, who was sitting opposite, and I saw, as she\nlooked at me, that her eyes were filled with tears and that tears\nwere falling down her face. I felt that I had only to be placid and\nmerry once for all to undeceive my dear and set her loving heart at\nrest. I really was so, and I had nothing to do but to be myself.\n\nSo I made my sweet girl lean upon my shoulder--how little thinking\nwhat was heavy on her mind!--and I said she was not quite well, and\nput my arm about her, and took her upstairs. When we were in our own\nroom, and when she might perhaps have told me what I was so\nunprepared to hear, I gave her no encouragement to confide in me; I\nnever thought she stood in need of it.\n\n\"Oh, my dear good Esther,\" said Ada, \"if I could only make up my mind\nto speak to you and my cousin John when you are together!\"\n\n\"Why, my love!\" I remonstrated. \"Ada, why should you not speak to\nus!\"\n\nAda only dropped her head and pressed me closer to her heart.\n\n\"You surely don't forget, my beauty,\" said I, smiling, \"what quiet,\nold-fashioned people we are and how I have settled down to be the\ndiscreetest of dames? You don't forget how happily and peacefully my\nlife is all marked out for me, and by whom? I am certain that you\ndon't forget by what a noble character, Ada. That can never be.\"\n\n\"No, never, Esther.\"\n\n\"Why then, my dear,\" said I, \"there can be nothing amiss--and why\nshould you not speak to us?\"\n\n\"Nothing amiss, Esther?\" returned Ada. \"Oh, when I think of all these\nyears, and of his fatherly care and kindness, and of the old\nrelations among us, and of you, what shall I do, what shall I do!\"\n\nI looked at my child in some wonder, but I thought it better not to\nanswer otherwise than by cheering her, and so I turned off into many\nlittle recollections of our life together and prevented her from\nsaying more. When she lay down to sleep, and not before, I returned\nto my guardian to say good night, and then I came back to Ada and sat\nnear her for a little while.\n\nShe was asleep, and I thought as I looked at her that she was a\nlittle changed. I had thought so more than once lately. I could not\ndecide, even looking at her while she was unconscious, how she was\nchanged, but something in the familiar beauty of her face looked\ndifferent to me. My guardian's old hopes of her and Richard arose\nsorrowfully in my mind, and I said to myself, \"She has been anxious\nabout him,\" and I wondered how that love would end.\n\nWhen I had come home from Caddy's while she was ill, I had often\nfound Ada at work, and she had always put her work away, and I had\nnever known what it was. Some of it now lay in a drawer near her,\nwhich was not quite closed. I did not open the drawer, but I still\nrather wondered what the work could be, for it was evidently nothing\nfor herself.\n\nAnd I noticed as I kissed my dear that she lay with one hand under\nher pillow so that it was hidden.\n\nHow much less amiable I must have been than they thought me, how much\nless amiable than I thought myself, to be so preoccupied with my own\ncheerfulness and contentment as to think that it only rested with me\nto put my dear girl right and set her mind at peace!\n\nBut I lay down, self-deceived, in that belief. And I awoke in it next\nday to find that there was still the same shade between me and my\ndarling.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LI\n\nEnlightened\n\n\nWhen Mr. Woodcourt arrived in London, he went, that very same day, to\nMr. Vholes's in Symond's Inn. For he never once, from the moment when\nI entreated him to be a friend to Richard, neglected or forgot his\npromise. He had told me that he accepted the charge as a sacred\ntrust, and he was ever true to it in that spirit.\n\nHe found Mr. Vholes in his office and informed Mr. Vholes of his\nagreement with Richard that he should call there to learn his\naddress.\n\n\"Just so, sir,\" said Mr. Vholes. \"Mr. C.'s address is not a hundred\nmiles from here, sir, Mr. C.'s address is not a hundred miles from\nhere. Would you take a seat, sir?\"\n\nMr. Woodcourt thanked Mr. Vholes, but he had no business with him\nbeyond what he had mentioned.\n\n\"Just so, sir. I believe, sir,\" said Mr. Vholes, still quietly\ninsisting on the seat by not giving the address, \"that you have\ninfluence with Mr. C. Indeed I am aware that you have.\"\n\n\"I was not aware of it myself,\" returned Mr. Woodcourt; \"but I\nsuppose you know best.\"\n\n\"Sir,\" rejoined Mr. Vholes, self-contained as usual, voice and all,\n\"it is a part of my professional duty to know best. It is a part of\nmy professional duty to study and to understand a gentleman who\nconfides his interests to me. In my professional duty I shall not be\nwanting, sir, if I know it. I may, with the best intentions, be\nwanting in it without knowing it; but not if I know it, sir.\"\n\nMr. Woodcourt again mentioned the address.\n\n\"Give me leave, sir,\" said Mr. Vholes. \"Bear with me for a moment.\nSir, Mr. C. is playing for a considerable stake, and cannot play\nwithout--need I say what?\"\n\n\"Money, I presume?\"\n\n\"Sir,\" said Mr. Vholes, \"to be honest with you (honesty being my\ngolden rule, whether I gain by it or lose, and I find that I\ngenerally lose), money is the word. Now, sir, upon the chances of Mr.\nC.'s game I express to you no opinion, NO opinion. It might be highly\nimpolitic in Mr. C., after playing so long and so high, to leave off;\nit might be the reverse; I say nothing. No, sir,\" said Mr. Vholes,\nbringing his hand flat down upon his desk in a positive manner,\n\"nothing.\"\n\n\"You seem to forget,\" returned Mr. Woodcourt, \"that I ask you to say\nnothing and have no interest in anything you say.\"\n\n\"Pardon me, sir!\" retorted Mr. Vholes. \"You do yourself an injustice.\nNo, sir! Pardon me! You shall not--shall not in my office, if I know\nit--do yourself an injustice. You are interested in anything, and in\neverything, that relates to your friend. I know human nature much\nbetter, sir, than to admit for an instant that a gentleman of your\nappearance is not interested in whatever concerns his friend.\"\n\n\"Well,\" replied Mr. Woodcourt, \"that may be. I am particularly\ninterested in his address.\"\n\n\"The number, sir,\" said Mr. Vholes parenthetically, \"I believe I have\nalready mentioned. If Mr. C. is to continue to play for this\nconsiderable stake, sir, he must have funds. Understand me! There are\nfunds in hand at present. I ask for nothing; there are funds in hand.\nBut for the onward play, more funds must be provided, unless Mr. C.\nis to throw away what he has already ventured, which is wholly and\nsolely a point for his consideration. This, sir, I take the\nopportunity of stating openly to you as the friend of Mr. C. Without\nfunds I shall always be happy to appear and act for Mr. C. to the\nextent of all such costs as are safe to be allowed out of the estate,\nnot beyond that. I could not go beyond that, sir, without wronging\nsome one. I must either wrong my three dear girls or my venerable\nfather, who is entirely dependent on me, in the Vale of Taunton; or\nsome one. Whereas, sir, my resolution is (call it weakness or folly\nif you please) to wrong no one.\"\n\nMr. Woodcourt rather sternly rejoined that he was glad to hear it.\n\n\"I wish, sir,\" said Mr. Vholes, \"to leave a good name behind me.\nTherefore I take every opportunity of openly stating to a friend of\nMr. C. how Mr. C. is situated. As to myself, sir, the labourer is\nworthy of his hire. If I undertake to put my shoulder to the wheel, I\ndo it, and I earn what I get. I am here for that purpose. My name is\npainted on the door outside, with that object.\"\n\n\"And Mr. Carstone's address, Mr. Vholes?\"\n\n\"Sir,\" returned Mr. Vholes, \"as I believe I have already mentioned,\nit is next door. On the second story you will find Mr. C.'s\napartments. Mr. C. desires to be near his professional adviser, and I\nam far from objecting, for I court inquiry.\"\n\nUpon this Mr. Woodcourt wished Mr. Vholes good day and went in search\nof Richard, the change in whose appearance he began to understand now\nbut too well.\n\nHe found him in a dull room, fadedly furnished, much as I had found\nhim in his barrack-room but a little while before, except that he was\nnot writing but was sitting with a book before him, from which his\neyes and thoughts were far astray. As the door chanced to be standing\nopen, Mr. Woodcourt was in his presence for some moments without\nbeing perceived, and he told me that he never could forget the\nhaggardness of his face and the dejection of his manner before he was\naroused from his dream.\n\n\"Woodcourt, my dear fellow,\" cried Richard, starting up with extended\nhands, \"you come upon my vision like a ghost.\"\n\n\"A friendly one,\" he replied, \"and only waiting, as they say ghosts\ndo, to be addressed. How does the mortal world go?\" They were seated\nnow, near together.\n\n\"Badly enough, and slowly enough,\" said Richard, \"speaking at least\nfor my part of it.\"\n\n\"What part is that?\"\n\n\"The Chancery part.\"\n\n\"I never heard,\" returned Mr. Woodcourt, shaking his head, \"of its\ngoing well yet.\"\n\n\"Nor I,\" said Richard moodily. \"Who ever did?\" He brightened again in\na moment and said with his natural openness, \"Woodcourt, I should be\nsorry to be misunderstood by you, even if I gained by it in your\nestimation. You must know that I have done no good this long time. I\nhave not intended to do much harm, but I seem to have been capable of\nnothing else. It may be that I should have done better by keeping out\nof the net into which my destiny has worked me, but I think not,\nthough I dare say you will soon hear, if you have not already heard,\na very different opinion. To make short of a long story, I am afraid\nI have wanted an object; but I have an object now--or it has me--and\nit is too late to discuss it. Take me as I am, and make the best of\nme.\"\n\n\"A bargain,\" said Mr. Woodcourt. \"Do as much by me in return.\"\n\n\"Oh! You,\" returned Richard, \"you can pursue your art for its own\nsake, and can put your hand upon the plough and never turn, and can\nstrike a purpose out of anything. You and I are very different\ncreatures.\"\n\nHe spoke regretfully and lapsed for a moment into his weary\ncondition.\n\n\"Well, well!\" he cried, shaking it off. \"Everything has an end. We\nshall see! So you will take me as I am, and make the best of me?\"\n\n\"Aye! Indeed I will.\" They shook hands upon it laughingly, but in\ndeep earnestness. I can answer for one of them with my heart of\nhearts.\n\n\"You come as a godsend,\" said Richard, \"for I have seen nobody here\nyet but Vholes. Woodcourt, there is one subject I should like to\nmention, for once and for all, in the beginning of our treaty. You\ncan hardly make the best of me if I don't. You know, I dare say, that\nI have an attachment to my cousin Ada?\"\n\nMr. Woodcourt replied that I had hinted as much to him. \"Now pray,\"\nreturned Richard, \"don't think me a heap of selfishness. Don't\nsuppose that I am splitting my head and half breaking my heart over\nthis miserable Chancery suit for my own rights and interests alone.\nAda's are bound up with mine; they can't be separated; Vholes works\nfor both of us. Do think of that!\"\n\nHe was so very solicitous on this head that Mr. Woodcourt gave him\nthe strongest assurances that he did him no injustice.\n\n\"You see,\" said Richard, with something pathetic in his manner of\nlingering on the point, though it was off-hand and unstudied, \"to an\nupright fellow like you, bringing a friendly face like yours here, I\ncannot bear the thought of appearing selfish and mean. I want to see\nAda righted, Woodcourt, as well as myself; I want to do my utmost to\nright her, as well as myself; I venture what I can scrape together to\nextricate her, as well as myself. Do, I beseech you, think of that!\"\n\nAfterwards, when Mr. Woodcourt came to reflect on what had passed, he\nwas so very much impressed by the strength of Richard's anxiety on\nthis point that in telling me generally of his first visit to\nSymond's Inn he particularly dwelt upon it. It revived a fear I had\nhad before that my dear girl's little property would be absorbed by\nMr. Vholes and that Richard's justification to himself would be\nsincerely this. It was just as I began to take care of Caddy that the\ninterview took place, and I now return to the time when Caddy had\nrecovered and the shade was still between me and my darling.\n\nI proposed to Ada that morning that we should go and see Richard. It\na little surprised me to find that she hesitated and was not so\nradiantly willing as I had expected.\n\n\"My dear,\" said I, \"you have not had any difference with Richard\nsince I have been so much away?\"\n\n\"No, Esther.\"\n\n\"Not heard of him, perhaps?\" said I.\n\n\"Yes, I have heard of him,\" said Ada.\n\nSuch tears in her eyes, and such love in her face. I could not make\nmy darling out. Should I go to Richard's by myself? I said. No, Ada\nthought I had better not go by myself. Would she go with me? Yes, Ada\nthought she had better go with me. Should we go now? Yes, let us go\nnow. Well, I could not understand my darling, with the tears in her\neyes and the love in her face!\n\nWe were soon equipped and went out. It was a sombre day, and drops of\nchill rain fell at intervals. It was one of those colourless days\nwhen everything looks heavy and harsh. The houses frowned at us, the\ndust rose at us, the smoke swooped at us, nothing made any compromise\nabout itself or wore a softened aspect. I fancied my beautiful girl\nquite out of place in the rugged streets, and I thought there were\nmore funerals passing along the dismal pavements than I had ever seen\nbefore.\n\nWe had first to find out Symond's Inn. We were going to inquire in a\nshop when Ada said she thought it was near Chancery Lane. \"We are not\nlikely to be far out, my love, if we go in that direction,\" said I.\nSo to Chancery Lane we went, and there, sure enough, we saw it\nwritten up. Symond's Inn.\n\nWe had next to find out the number. \"Or Mr. Vholes's office will do,\"\nI recollected, \"for Mr. Vholes's office is next door.\" Upon which Ada\nsaid, perhaps that was Mr. Vholes's office in the corner there. And\nit really was.\n\nThen came the question, which of the two next doors? I was going for\nthe one, and my darling was going for the other; and my darling was\nright again. So up we went to the second story, when we came to\nRichard's name in great white letters on a hearse-like panel.\n\nI should have knocked, but Ada said perhaps we had better turn the\nhandle and go in. Thus we came to Richard, poring over a table\ncovered with dusty bundles of papers which seemed to me like dusty\nmirrors reflecting his own mind. Wherever I looked I saw the ominous\nwords that ran in it repeated. Jarndyce and Jarndyce.\n\nHe received us very affectionately, and we sat down. \"If you had come\na little earlier,\" he said, \"you would have found Woodcourt here.\nThere never was such a good fellow as Woodcourt is. He finds time to\nlook in between-whiles, when anybody else with half his work to do\nwould be thinking about not being able to come. And he is so cheery,\nso fresh, so sensible, so earnest, so--everything that I am not, that\nthe place brightens whenever he comes, and darkens whenever he goes\nagain.\"\n\n\"God bless him,\" I thought, \"for his truth to me!\"\n\n\"He is not so sanguine, Ada,\" continued Richard, casting his dejected\nlook over the bundles of papers, \"as Vholes and I are usually, but he\nis only an outsider and is not in the mysteries. We have gone into\nthem, and he has not. He can't be expected to know much of such a\nlabyrinth.\"\n\nAs his look wandered over the papers again and he passed his two\nhands over his head, I noticed how sunken and how large his eyes\nappeared, how dry his lips were, and how his finger-nails were all\nbitten away.\n\n\"Is this a healthy place to live in, Richard, do you think?\" said I.\n\n\"Why, my dear Minerva,\" answered Richard with his old gay laugh, \"it\nis neither a rural nor a cheerful place; and when the sun shines\nhere, you may lay a pretty heavy wager that it is shining brightly in\nan open spot. But it's well enough for the time. It's near the\noffices and near Vholes.\"\n\n\"Perhaps,\" I hinted, \"a change from both--\"\n\n\"Might do me good?\" said Richard, forcing a laugh as he finished the\nsentence. \"I shouldn't wonder! But it can only come in one way\nnow--in one of two ways, I should rather say. Either the suit must be\nended, Esther, or the suitor. But it shall be the suit, my dear girl,\nthe suit, my dear girl!\"\n\nThese latter words were addressed to Ada, who was sitting nearest to\nhim. Her face being turned away from me and towards him, I could not\nsee it.\n\n\"We are doing very well,\" pursued Richard. \"Vholes will tell you so.\nWe are really spinning along. Ask Vholes. We are giving them no rest.\nVholes knows all their windings and turnings, and we are upon them\neverywhere. We have astonished them already. We shall rouse up that\nnest of sleepers, mark my words!\"\n\nHis hopefulness had long been more painful to me than his\ndespondency; it was so unlike hopefulness, had something so fierce in\nits determination to be it, was so hungry and eager, and yet so\nconscious of being forced and unsustainable that it had long touched\nme to the heart. But the commentary upon it now indelibly written in\nhis handsome face made it far more distressing than it used to be. I\nsay indelibly, for I felt persuaded that if the fatal cause could\nhave been for ever terminated, according to his brightest visions, in\nthat same hour, the traces of the premature anxiety, self-reproach,\nand disappointment it had occasioned him would have remained upon his\nfeatures to the hour of his death.\n\n\"The sight of our dear little woman,\" said Richard, Ada still\nremaining silent and quiet, \"is so natural to me, and her\ncompassionate face is so like the face of old days--\"\n\nAh! No, no. I smiled and shook my head.\n\n\"--So exactly like the face of old days,\" said Richard in his cordial\nvoice, and taking my hand with the brotherly regard which nothing\never changed, \"that I can't make pretences with her. I fluctuate a\nlittle; that's the truth. Sometimes I hope, my dear, and sometimes\nI--don't quite despair, but nearly. I get,\" said Richard,\nrelinquishing my hand gently and walking across the room, \"so tired!\"\n\nHe took a few turns up and down and sunk upon the sofa. \"I get,\" he\nrepeated gloomily, \"so tired. It is such weary, weary work!\"\n\nHe was leaning on his arm saying these words in a meditative voice\nand looking at the ground when my darling rose, put off her bonnet,\nkneeled down beside him with her golden hair falling like sunlight on\nhis head, clasped her two arms round his neck, and turned her face to\nme. Oh, what a loving and devoted face I saw!\n\n\"Esther, dear,\" she said very quietly, \"I am not going home again.\"\n\nA light shone in upon me all at once.\n\n\"Never any more. I am going to stay with my dear husband. We have\nbeen married above two months. Go home without me, my own Esther; I\nshall never go home any more!\" With those words my darling drew his\nhead down on her breast and held it there. And if ever in my life I\nsaw a love that nothing but death could change, I saw it then before\nme.\n\n\"Speak to Esther, my dearest,\" said Richard, breaking the silence\npresently. \"Tell her how it was.\"\n\nI met her before she could come to me and folded her in my arms. We\nneither of us spoke, but with her cheek against my own I wanted to\nhear nothing. \"My pet,\" said I. \"My love. My poor, poor girl!\" I\npitied her so much. I was very fond of Richard, but the impulse that\nI had upon me was to pity her so much.\n\n\"Esther, will you forgive me? Will my cousin John forgive me?\"\n\n\"My dear,\" said I, \"to doubt it for a moment is to do him a great\nwrong. And as to me!\" Why, as to me, what had I to forgive!\n\nI dried my sobbing darling's eyes and sat beside her on the sofa, and\nRichard sat on my other side; and while I was reminded of that so\ndifferent night when they had first taken me into their confidence\nand had gone on in their own wild happy way, they told me between\nthem how it was.\n\n\"All I had was Richard's,\" Ada said; \"and Richard would not take it,\nEsther, and what could I do but be his wife when I loved him dearly!\"\n\n\"And you were so fully and so kindly occupied, excellent Dame\nDurden,\" said Richard, \"that how could we speak to you at such a\ntime! And besides, it was not a long-considered step. We went out one\nmorning and were married.\"\n\n\"And when it was done, Esther,\" said my darling, \"I was always\nthinking how to tell you and what to do for the best. And sometimes I\nthought you ought to know it directly, and sometimes I thought you\nought not to know it and keep it from my cousin John; and I could not\ntell what to do, and I fretted very much.\"\n\nHow selfish I must have been not to have thought of this before! I\ndon't know what I said now. I was so sorry, and yet I was so fond of\nthem and so glad that they were fond of me; I pitied them so much,\nand yet I felt a kind of pride in their loving one another. I never\nhad experienced such painful and pleasurable emotion at one time, and\nin my own heart I did not know which predominated. But I was not\nthere to darken their way; I did not do that.\n\nWhen I was less foolish and more composed, my darling took her\nwedding-ring from her bosom, and kissed it, and put it on. Then I\nremembered last night and told Richard that ever since her marriage\nshe had worn it at night when there was no one to see. Then Ada\nblushingly asked me how did I know that, my dear. Then I told Ada how\nI had seen her hand concealed under her pillow and had little thought\nwhy, my dear. Then they began telling me how it was all over again,\nand I began to be sorry and glad again, and foolish again, and to\nhide my plain old face as much as I could lest I should put them out\nof heart.\n\nThus the time went on until it became necessary for me to think of\nreturning. When that time arrived it was the worst of all, for then\nmy darling completely broke down. She clung round my neck, calling me\nby every dear name she could think of and saying what should she do\nwithout me! Nor was Richard much better; and as for me, I should have\nbeen the worst of the three if I had not severely said to myself,\n\"Now Esther, if you do, I'll never speak to you again!\"\n\n\"Why, I declare,\" said I, \"I never saw such a wife. I don't think she\nloves her husband at all. Here, Richard, take my child, for goodness'\nsake.\" But I held her tight all the while, and could have wept over\nher I don't know how long.\n\n\"I give this dear young couple notice,\" said I, \"that I am only going\naway to come back to-morrow and that I shall be always coming\nbackwards and forwards until Symond's Inn is tired of the sight of\nme. So I shall not say good-bye, Richard. For what would be the use\nof that, you know, when I am coming back so soon!\"\n\nI had given my darling to him now, and I meant to go; but I lingered\nfor one more look of the precious face which it seemed to rive my\nheart to turn from.\n\nSo I said (in a merry, bustling manner) that unless they gave me some\nencouragement to come back, I was not sure that I could take that\nliberty, upon which my dear girl looked up, faintly smiling through\nher tears, and I folded her lovely face between my hands, and gave it\none last kiss, and laughed, and ran away.\n\nAnd when I got downstairs, oh, how I cried! It almost seemed to me\nthat I had lost my Ada for ever. I was so lonely and so blank without\nher, and it was so desolate to be going home with no hope of seeing\nher there, that I could get no comfort for a little while as I walked\nup and down in a dim corner sobbing and crying.\n\nI came to myself by and by, after a little scolding, and took a coach\nhome. The poor boy whom I had found at St. Albans had reappeared a\nshort time before and was lying at the point of death; indeed, was\nthen dead, though I did not know it. My guardian had gone out to\ninquire about him and did not return to dinner. Being quite alone, I\ncried a little again, though on the whole I don't think I behaved so\nvery, very ill.\n\nIt was only natural that I should not be quite accustomed to the loss\nof my darling yet. Three or four hours were not a long time after\nyears. But my mind dwelt so much upon the uncongenial scene in which\nI had left her, and I pictured it as such an overshadowed\nstony-hearted one, and I so longed to be near her and taking some\nsort of care of her, that I determined to go back in the evening only\nto look up at her windows.\n\nIt was foolish, I dare say, but it did not then seem at all so to me,\nand it does not seem quite so even now. I took Charley into my\nconfidence, and we went out at dusk. It was dark when we came to the\nnew strange home of my dear girl, and there was a light behind the\nyellow blinds. We walked past cautiously three or four times, looking\nup, and narrowly missed encountering Mr. Vholes, who came out of his\noffice while we were there and turned his head to look up too before\ngoing home. The sight of his lank black figure and the lonesome air\nof that nook in the dark were favourable to the state of my mind. I\nthought of the youth and love and beauty of my dear girl, shut up in\nsuch an ill-assorted refuge, almost as if it were a cruel place.\n\nIt was very solitary and very dull, and I did not doubt that I might\nsafely steal upstairs. I left Charley below and went up with a light\nfoot, not distressed by any glare from the feeble oil lanterns on the\nway. I listened for a few moments, and in the musty rotting silence\nof the house believed that I could hear the murmur of their young\nvoices. I put my lips to the hearse-like panel of the door as a kiss\nfor my dear and came quietly down again, thinking that one of these\ndays I would confess to the visit.\n\nAnd it really did me good, for though nobody but Charley and I knew\nanything about it, I somehow felt as if it had diminished the\nseparation between Ada and me and had brought us together again for\nthose moments. I went back, not quite accustomed yet to the change,\nbut all the better for that hovering about my darling.\n\nMy guardian had come home and was standing thoughtfully by the dark\nwindow. When I went in, his face cleared and he came to his seat, but\nhe caught the light upon my face as I took mine.\n\n\"Little woman,\" said he, \"You have been crying.\"\n\n\"Why, yes, guardian,\" said I, \"I am afraid I have been, a little. Ada\nhas been in such distress, and is so very sorry, guardian.\"\n\nI put my arm on the back of his chair, and I saw in his glance that\nmy words and my look at her empty place had prepared him.\n\n\"Is she married, my dear?\"\n\nI told him all about it and how her first entreaties had referred to\nhis forgiveness.\n\n\"She has no need of it,\" said he. \"Heaven bless her and her husband!\"\nBut just as my first impulse had been to pity her, so was his. \"Poor\ngirl, poor girl! Poor Rick! Poor Ada!\"\n\nNeither of us spoke after that, until he said with a sigh, \"Well,\nwell, my dear! Bleak House is thinning fast.\"\n\n\"But its mistress remains, guardian.\" Though I was timid about saying\nit, I ventured because of the sorrowful tone in which he had spoken.\n\"She will do all she can to make it happy,\" said I.\n\n\"She will succeed, my love!\"\n\nThe letter had made no difference between us except that the seat by\nhis side had come to be mine; it made none now. He turned his old\nbright fatherly look upon me, laid his hand on my hand in his old\nway, and said again, \"She will succeed, my dear. Nevertheless, Bleak\nHouse is thinning fast, O little woman!\"\n\nI was sorry presently that this was all we said about that. I was\nrather disappointed. I feared I might not quite have been all I had\nmeant to be since the letter and the answer.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LII\n\nObstinacy\n\n\nBut one other day had intervened when, early in the morning as we\nwere going to breakfast, Mr. Woodcourt came in haste with the\nastounding news that a terrible murder had been committed for which\nMr. George had been apprehended and was in custody. When he told us\nthat a large reward was offered by Sir Leicester Dedlock for the\nmurderer's apprehension, I did not in my first consternation\nunderstand why; but a few more words explained to me that the\nmurdered person was Sir Leicester's lawyer, and immediately my\nmother's dread of him rushed into my remembrance.\n\nThis unforeseen and violent removal of one whom she had long watched\nand distrusted and who had long watched and distrusted her, one for\nwhom she could have had few intervals of kindness, always dreading in\nhim a dangerous and secret enemy, appeared so awful that my first\nthoughts were of her. How appalling to hear of such a death and be\nable to feel no pity! How dreadful to remember, perhaps, that she had\nsometimes even wished the old man away who was so swiftly hurried out\nof life!\n\nSuch crowding reflections, increasing the distress and fear I always\nfelt when the name was mentioned, made me so agitated that I could\nscarcely hold my place at the table. I was quite unable to follow the\nconversation until I had had a little time to recover. But when I\ncame to myself and saw how shocked my guardian was and found that\nthey were earnestly speaking of the suspected man and recalling every\nfavourable impression we had formed of him out of the good we had\nknown of him, my interest and my fears were so strongly aroused in\nhis behalf that I was quite set up again.\n\n\"Guardian, you don't think it possible that he is justly accused?\"\n\n\"My dear, I CAN'T think so. This man whom we have seen so\nopen-hearted and compassionate, who with the might of a giant has the\ngentleness of a child, who looks as brave a fellow as ever lived and\nis so simple and quiet with it, this man justly accused of such a\ncrime? I can't believe it. It's not that I don't or I won't. I\ncan't!\"\n\n\"And I can't,\" said Mr. Woodcourt. \"Still, whatever we believe or\nknow of him, we had better not forget that some appearances are\nagainst him. He bore an animosity towards the deceased gentleman. He\nhas openly mentioned it in many places. He is said to have expressed\nhimself violently towards him, and he certainly did about him, to my\nknowledge. He admits that he was alone on the scene of the murder\nwithin a few minutes of its commission. I sincerely believe him to be\nas innocent of any participation in it as I am, but these are all\nreasons for suspicion falling upon him.\"\n\n\"True,\" said my guardian. And he added, turning to me, \"It would be\ndoing him a very bad service, my dear, to shut our eyes to the truth\nin any of these respects.\"\n\nI felt, of course, that we must admit, not only to ourselves but to\nothers, the full force of the circumstances against him. Yet I knew\nwithal (I could not help saying) that their weight would not induce\nus to desert him in his need.\n\n\"Heaven forbid!\" returned my guardian. \"We will stand by him, as he\nhimself stood by the two poor creatures who are gone.\" He meant Mr.\nGridley and the boy, to both of whom Mr. George had given shelter.\n\nMr. Woodcourt then told us that the trooper's man had been with him\nbefore day, after wandering about the streets all night like a\ndistracted creature. That one of the trooper's first anxieties was\nthat we should not suppose him guilty. That he had charged his\nmessenger to represent his perfect innocence with every solemn\nassurance he could send us. That Mr. Woodcourt had only quieted the\nman by undertaking to come to our house very early in the morning\nwith these representations. He added that he was now upon his way to\nsee the prisoner himself.\n\nMy guardian said directly he would go too. Now, besides that I liked\nthe retired soldier very much and that he liked me, I had that secret\ninterest in what had happened which was only known to my guardian. I\nfelt as if it came close and near to me. It seemed to become\npersonally important to myself that the truth should be discovered\nand that no innocent people should be suspected, for suspicion, once\nrun wild, might run wilder.\n\nIn a word, I felt as if it were my duty and obligation to go with\nthem. My guardian did not seek to dissuade me, and I went.\n\nIt was a large prison with many courts and passages so like one\nanother and so uniformly paved that I seemed to gain a new\ncomprehension, as I passed along, of the fondness that solitary\nprisoners, shut up among the same staring walls from year to year,\nhave had--as I have read--for a weed or a stray blade of grass. In an\narched room by himself, like a cellar upstairs, with walls so\nglaringly white that they made the massive iron window-bars and\niron-bound door even more profoundly black than they were, we found\nthe trooper standing in a corner. He had been sitting on a bench\nthere and had risen when he heard the locks and bolts turn.\n\nWhen he saw us, he came forward a step with his usual heavy tread,\nand there stopped and made a slight bow. But as I still advanced,\nputting out my hand to him, he understood us in a moment.\n\n\"This is a load off my mind, I do assure you, miss and gentlemen,\"\nsaid he, saluting us with great heartiness and drawing a long breath.\n\"And now I don't so much care how it ends.\"\n\nHe scarcely seemed to be the prisoner. What with his coolness and his\nsoldierly bearing, he looked far more like the prison guard.\n\n\"This is even a rougher place than my gallery to receive a lady in,\"\nsaid Mr. George, \"but I know Miss Summerson will make the best of\nit.\" As he handed me to the bench on which he had been sitting, I sat\ndown, which seemed to give him great satisfaction.\n\n\"I thank you, miss,\" said he.\n\n\"Now, George,\" observed my guardian, \"as we require no new assurances\non your part, so I believe we need give you none on ours.\"\n\n\"Not at all, sir. I thank you with all my heart. If I was not\ninnocent of this crime, I couldn't look at you and keep my secret to\nmyself under the condescension of the present visit. I feel the\npresent visit very much. I am not one of the eloquent sort, but I\nfeel it, Miss Summerson and gentlemen, deeply.\"\n\nHe laid his hand for a moment on his broad chest and bent his head to\nus. Although he squared himself again directly, he expressed a great\namount of natural emotion by these simple means.\n\n\"First,\" said my guardian, \"can we do anything for your personal\ncomfort, George?\"\n\n\"For which, sir?\" he inquired, clearing his throat.\n\n\"For your personal comfort. Is there anything you want that would\nlessen the hardship of this confinement?\"\n\n\"Well, sir,\" replied George, after a little cogitation, \"I am equally\nobliged to you, but tobacco being against the rules, I can't say that\nthere is.\"\n\n\"You will think of many little things perhaps, by and by. Whenever\nyou do, George, let us know.\"\n\n\"Thank you, sir. Howsoever,\" observed Mr. George with one of his\nsunburnt smiles, \"a man who has been knocking about the world in a\nvagabond kind of a way as long as I have gets on well enough in a\nplace like the present, so far as that goes.\"\n\n\"Next, as to your case,\" observed my guardian.\n\n\"Exactly so, sir,\" returned Mr. George, folding his arms upon his\nbreast with perfect self-possession and a little curiosity.\n\n\"How does it stand now?\"\n\n\"Why, sir, it is under remand at present. Bucket gives me to\nunderstand that he will probably apply for a series of remands from\ntime to time until the case is more complete. How it is to be made\nmore complete I don't myself see, but I dare say Bucket will manage\nit somehow.\"\n\n\"Why, heaven save us, man,\" exclaimed my guardian, surprised into his\nold oddity and vehemence, \"you talk of yourself as if you were\nsomebody else!\"\n\n\"No offence, sir,\" said Mr. George. \"I am very sensible of your\nkindness. But I don't see how an innocent man is to make up his mind\nto this kind of thing without knocking his head against the walls\nunless he takes it in that point of view.\n\n\"That is true enough to a certain extent,\" returned my guardian,\nsoftened. \"But my good fellow, even an innocent man must take\nordinary precautions to defend himself.\"\n\n\"Certainly, sir. And I have done so. I have stated to the\nmagistrates, 'Gentlemen, I am as innocent of this charge as\nyourselves; what has been stated against me in the way of facts is\nperfectly true; I know no more about it.' I intend to continue\nstating that, sir. What more can I do? It's the truth.\"\n\n\"But the mere truth won't do,\" rejoined my guardian.\n\n\"Won't it indeed, sir? Rather a bad look-out for me!\" Mr. George\ngood-humouredly observed.\n\n\"You must have a lawyer,\" pursued my guardian. \"We must engage a good\none for you.\"\n\n\"I ask your pardon, sir,\" said Mr. George with a step backward. \"I am\nequally obliged. But I must decidedly beg to be excused from anything\nof that sort.\"\n\n\"You won't have a lawyer?\"\n\n\"No, sir.\" Mr. George shook his head in the most emphatic manner. \"I\nthank you all the same, sir, but--no lawyer!\"\n\n\"Why not?\"\n\n\"I don't take kindly to the breed,\" said Mr. George. \"Gridley didn't.\nAnd--if you'll excuse my saying so much--I should hardly have thought\nyou did yourself, sir.\"\n\n\"That's equity,\" my guardian explained, a little at a loss; \"that's\nequity, George.\"\n\n\"Is it, indeed, sir?\" returned the trooper in his off-hand manner. \"I\nam not acquainted with those shades of names myself, but in a general\nway I object to the breed.\"\n\nUnfolding his arms and changing his position, he stood with one\nmassive hand upon the table and the other on his hip, as complete a\npicture of a man who was not to be moved from a fixed purpose as ever\nI saw. It was in vain that we all three talked to him and endeavoured\nto persuade him; he listened with that gentleness which went so well\nwith his bluff bearing, but was evidently no more shaken by our\nrepresentations that his place of confinement was.\n\n\"Pray think, once more, Mr. George,\" said I. \"Have you no wish in\nreference to your case?\"\n\n\"I certainly could wish it to be tried, miss,\" he returned, \"by\ncourt-martial; but that is out of the question, as I am well aware.\nIf you will be so good as to favour me with your attention for a\ncouple of minutes, miss, not more, I'll endeavour to explain myself\nas clearly as I can.\"\n\nHe looked at us all three in turn, shook his head a little as if he\nwere adjusting it in the stock and collar of a tight uniform, and\nafter a moment's reflection went on.\n\n\"You see, miss, I have been handcuffed and taken into custody and\nbrought here. I am a marked and disgraced man, and here I am. My\nshooting gallery is rummaged, high and low, by Bucket; such property\nas I have--'tis small--is turned this way and that till it don't know\nitself; and (as aforesaid) here I am! I don't particular complain of\nthat. Though I am in these present quarters through no immediately\npreceding fault of mine, I can very well understand that if I hadn't\ngone into the vagabond way in my youth, this wouldn't have happened.\nIt HAS happened. Then comes the question how to meet it.\"\n\nHe rubbed his swarthy forehead for a moment with a good-humoured look\nand said apologetically, \"I am such a short-winded talker that I must\nthink a bit.\" Having thought a bit, he looked up again and resumed.\n\n\"How to meet it. Now, the unfortunate deceased was himself a lawyer\nand had a pretty tight hold of me. I don't wish to rake up his ashes,\nbut he had, what I should call if he was living, a devil of a tight\nhold of me. I don't like his trade the better for that. If I had kept\nclear of his trade, I should have kept outside this place. But that's\nnot what I mean. Now, suppose I had killed him. Suppose I really had\ndischarged into his body any one of those pistols recently fired off\nthat Bucket has found at my place, and dear me, might have found\nthere any day since it has been my place. What should I have done as\nsoon as I was hard and fast here? Got a lawyer.\"\n\nHe stopped on hearing some one at the locks and bolts and did not\nresume until the door had been opened and was shut again. For what\npurpose opened, I will mention presently.\n\n\"I should have got a lawyer, and he would have said (as I have often\nread in the newspapers), 'My client says nothing, my client reserves\nhis defence': my client this, that, and t'other. Well, 'tis not the\ncustom of that breed to go straight, according to my opinion, or to\nthink that other men do. Say I am innocent and I get a lawyer. He\nwould be as likely to believe me guilty as not; perhaps more. What\nwould he do, whether or not? Act as if I was--shut my mouth up, tell\nme not to commit myself, keep circumstances back, chop the evidence\nsmall, quibble, and get me off perhaps! But, Miss Summerson, do I\ncare for getting off in that way; or would I rather be hanged in my\nown way--if you'll excuse my mentioning anything so disagreeable to a\nlady?\"\n\nHe had warmed into his subject now, and was under no further\nnecessity to wait a bit.\n\n\"I would rather be hanged in my own way. And I mean to be! I don't\nintend to say,\" looking round upon us with his powerful arms akimbo\nand his dark eyebrows raised, \"that I am more partial to being hanged\nthan another man. What I say is, I must come off clear and full or\nnot at all. Therefore, when I hear stated against me what is true, I\nsay it's true; and when they tell me, 'whatever you say will be\nused,' I tell them I don't mind that; I mean it to be used. If they\ncan't make me innocent out of the whole truth, they are not likely to\ndo it out of anything less, or anything else. And if they are, it's\nworth nothing to me.\"\n\nTaking a pace or two over the stone floor, he came back to the table\nand finished what he had to say.\n\n\"I thank you, miss and gentlemen both, many times for your attention,\nand many times more for your interest. That's the plain state of the\nmatter as it points itself out to a mere trooper with a blunt\nbroadsword kind of a mind. I have never done well in life beyond my\nduty as a soldier, and if the worst comes after all, I shall reap\npretty much as I have sown. When I got over the first crash of being\nseized as a murderer--it don't take a rover who has knocked about so\nmuch as myself so very long to recover from a crash--I worked my way\nround to what you find me now. As such I shall remain. No relations\nwill be disgraced by me or made unhappy for me, and--and that's all\nI've got to say.\"\n\nThe door had been opened to admit another soldier-looking man of less\nprepossessing appearance at first sight and a weather-tanned,\nbright-eyed wholesome woman with a basket, who, from her entrance,\nhad been exceedingly attentive to all Mr. George had said. Mr. George\nhad received them with a familiar nod and a friendly look, but\nwithout any more particular greeting in the midst of his address. He\nnow shook them cordially by the hand and said, \"Miss Summerson and\ngentlemen, this is an old comrade of mine, Matthew Bagnet. And this\nis his wife, Mrs. Bagnet.\"\n\nMr. Bagnet made us a stiff military bow, and Mrs. Bagnet dropped us a\ncurtsy.\n\n\"Real good friends of mine, they are,\" sald Mr. George. \"It was at\ntheir house I was taken.\"\n\n\"With a second-hand wiolinceller,\" Mr. Bagnet put in, twitching his\nhead angrily. \"Of a good tone. For a friend. That money was no object\nto.\"\n\n\"Mat,\" said Mr. George, \"you have heard pretty well all I have been\nsaying to this lady and these two gentlemen. I know it meets your\napproval?\"\n\nMr. Bagnet, after considering, referred the point to his wife. \"Old\ngirl,\" said he. \"Tell him. Whether or not. It meets my approval.\"\n\n\"Why, George,\" exclaimed Mrs. Bagnet, who had been unpacking her\nbasket, in which there was a piece of cold pickled pork, a little tea\nand sugar, and a brown loaf, \"you ought to know it don't. You ought\nto know it's enough to drive a person wild to hear you. You won't be\ngot off this way, and you won't be got off that way--what do you mean\nby such picking and choosing? It's stuff and nonsense, George.\"\n\n\"Don't be severe upon me in my misfortunes, Mrs. Bagnet,\" said the\ntrooper lightly.\n\n\"Oh! Bother your misfortunes,\" cried Mrs. Bagnet, \"if they don't make\nyou more reasonable than that comes to. I never was so ashamed in my\nlife to hear a man talk folly as I have been to hear you talk this\nday to the present company. Lawyers? Why, what but too many cooks\nshould hinder you from having a dozen lawyers if the gentleman\nrecommended them to you.\"\n\n\"This is a very sensible woman,\" said my guardian. \"I hope you will\npersuade him, Mrs. Bagnet.\"\n\n\"Persuade him, sir?\" she returned. \"Lord bless you, no. You don't\nknow George. Now, there!\" Mrs. Bagnet left her basket to point him\nout with both her bare brown hands. \"There he stands! As self-willed\nand as determined a man, in the wrong way, as ever put a human\ncreature under heaven out of patience! You could as soon take up and\nshoulder an eight and forty pounder by your own strength as turn that\nman when he has got a thing into his head and fixed it there. Why,\ndon't I know him!\" cried Mrs. Bagnet. \"Don't I know you, George! You\ndon't mean to set up for a new character with ME after all these\nyears, I hope?\"\n\nHer friendly indignation had an exemplary effect upon her husband,\nwho shook his head at the trooper several times as a silent\nrecommendation to him to yield. Between whiles, Mrs. Bagnet looked at\nme; and I understood from the play of her eyes that she wished me to\ndo something, though I did not comprehend what.\n\n\"But I have given up talking to you, old fellow, years and years,\"\nsaid Mrs. Bagnet as she blew a little dust off the pickled pork,\nlooking at me again; \"and when ladies and gentlemen know you as well\nas I do, they'll give up talking to you too. If you are not too\nheadstrong to accept of a bit of dinner, here it is.\"\n\n\"I accept it with many thanks,\" returned the trooper.\n\n\"Do you though, indeed?\" said Mrs. Bagnet, continuing to grumble on\ngood-humouredly. \"I'm sure I'm surprised at that. I wonder you don't\nstarve in your own way also. It would only be like you. Perhaps\nyou'll set your mind upon THAT next.\" Here she again looked at me,\nand I now perceived from her glances at the door and at me, by turns,\nthat she wished us to retire and to await her following us outside\nthe prison. Communicating this by similar means to my guardian and\nMr. Woodcourt, I rose.\n\n\"We hope you will think better of it, Mr. George,\" said I, \"and we\nshall come to see you again, trusting to find you more reasonable.\"\n\n\"More grateful, Miss Summerson, you can't find me,\" he returned.\n\n\"But more persuadable we can, I hope,\" said I. \"And let me entreat\nyou to consider that the clearing up of this mystery and the\ndiscovery of the real perpetrator of this deed may be of the last\nimportance to others besides yourself.\"\n\nHe heard me respectfully but without much heeding these words, which\nI spoke a little turned from him, already on my way to the door; he\nwas observing (this they afterwards told me) my height and figure,\nwhich seemed to catch his attention all at once.\n\n\"'Tis curious,\" said he. \"And yet I thought so at the time!\"\n\nMy guardian asked him what he meant.\n\n\"Why, sir,\" he answered, \"when my ill fortune took me to the dead\nman's staircase on the night of his murder, I saw a shape so like\nMiss Summerson's go by me in the dark that I had half a mind to speak\nto it.\"\n\nFor an instant I felt such a shudder as I never felt before or since\nand hope I shall never feel again.\n\n\"It came downstairs as I went up,\" said the trooper, \"and crossed the\nmoonlighted window with a loose black mantle on; I noticed a deep\nfringe to it. However, it has nothing to do with the present subject,\nexcepting that Miss Summerson looked so like it at the moment that it\ncame into my head.\"\n\nI cannot separate and define the feelings that arose in me after\nthis; it is enough that the vague duty and obligation I had felt upon\nme from the first of following the investigation was, without my\ndistinctly daring to ask myself any question, increased, and that I\nwas indignantly sure of there being no possibility of a reason for my\nbeing afraid.\n\nWe three went out of the prison and walked up and down at some short\ndistance from the gate, which was in a retired place. We had not\nwaited long when Mr. and Mrs. Bagnet came out too and quickly joined\nus.\n\nThere was a tear in each of Mrs. Bagnet's eyes, and her face was\nflushed and hurried. \"I didn't let George see what I thought about\nit, you know, miss,\" was her first remark when she came up, \"but he's\nin a bad way, poor old fellow!\"\n\n\"Not with care and prudence and good help,\" said my guardian.\n\n\"A gentleman like you ought to know best, sir,\" returned Mrs. Bagnet,\nhurriedly drying her eyes on the hem of her grey cloak, \"but I am\nuneasy for him. He has been so careless and said so much that he\nnever meant. The gentlemen of the juries might not understand him as\nLignum and me do. And then such a number of circumstances have\nhappened bad for him, and such a number of people will be brought\nforward to speak against him, and Bucket is so deep.\"\n\n\"With a second-hand wiolinceller. And said he played the fife. When a\nboy,\" Mr. Bagnet added with great solemnity.\n\n\"Now, I tell you, miss,\" said Mrs. Bagnet; \"and when I say miss, I\nmean all! Just come into the corner of the wall and I'll tell you!\"\n\nMrs. Bagnet hurried us into a more secluded place and was at first\ntoo breathless to proceed, occasioning Mr. Bagnet to say, \"Old girl!\nTell 'em!\"\n\n\"Why, then, miss,\" the old girl proceeded, untying the strings of her\nbonnet for more air, \"you could as soon move Dover Castle as move\nGeorge on this point unless you had got a new power to move him with.\nAnd I have got it!\"\n\n\"You are a jewel of a woman,\" said my guardian. \"Go on!\"\n\n\"Now, I tell you, miss,\" she proceeded, clapping her hands in her\nhurry and agitation a dozen times in every sentence, \"that what he\nsays concerning no relations is all bosh. They don't know of him, but\nhe does know of them. He has said more to me at odd times than to\nanybody else, and it warn't for nothing that he once spoke to my\nWoolwich about whitening and wrinkling mothers' heads. For fifty\npounds he had seen his mother that day. She's alive and must be\nbrought here straight!\"\n\nInstantly Mrs. Bagnet put some pins into her mouth and began pinning\nup her skirts all round a little higher than the level of her grey\ncloak, which she accomplished with surpassing dispatch and dexterity.\n\n\"Lignum,\" said Mrs. Bagnet, \"you take care of the children, old man,\nand give me the umbrella! I'm away to Lincolnshire to bring that old\nlady here.\"\n\n\"But, bless the woman,\" cried my guardian with his hand in his\npocket, \"how is she going? What money has she got?\"\n\nMrs. Bagnet made another application to her skirts and brought forth\na leathern purse in which she hastily counted over a few shillings\nand which she then shut up with perfect satisfaction.\n\n\"Never you mind for me, miss. I'm a soldier's wife and accustomed to\ntravel my own way. Lignum, old boy,\" kissing him, \"one for yourself,\nthree for the children. Now I'm away into Lincolnshire after George's\nmother!\"\n\nAnd she actually set off while we three stood looking at one another\nlost in amazement. She actually trudged away in her grey cloak at a\nsturdy pace, and turned the corner, and was gone.\n\n\"Mr. Bagnet,\" said my guardian. \"Do you mean to let her go in that\nway?\"\n\n\"Can't help it,\" he returned. \"Made her way home once from another\nquarter of the world. With the same grey cloak. And same umbrella.\nWhatever the old girl says, do. Do it! Whenever the old girl says,\nI'LL do it. She does it.\"\n\n\"Then she is as honest and genuine as she looks,\" rejoined my\nguardian, \"and it is impossible to say more for her.\"\n\n\"She's Colour-Sergeant of the Nonpareil battalion,\" said Mr. Bagnet,\nlooking at us over his shoulder as he went his way also. \"And there's\nnot such another. But I never own to it before her. Discipline must\nbe maintained.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LIII\n\nThe Track\n\n\nMr. Bucket and his fat forefinger are much in consultation together\nunder existing circumstances. When Mr. Bucket has a matter of this\npressing interest under his consideration, the fat forefinger seems\nto rise, to the dignity of a familiar demon. He puts it to his ears,\nand it whispers information; he puts it to his lips, and it enjoins\nhim to secrecy; he rubs it over his nose, and it sharpens his scent;\nhe shakes it before a guilty man, and it charms him to his\ndestruction. The Augurs of the Detective Temple invariably predict\nthat when Mr. Bucket and that finger are in much conference, a\nterrible avenger will be heard of before long.\n\nOtherwise mildly studious in his observation of human nature, on the\nwhole a benignant philosopher not disposed to be severe upon the\nfollies of mankind, Mr. Bucket pervades a vast number of houses and\nstrolls about an infinity of streets, to outward appearance rather\nlanguishing for want of an object. He is in the friendliest condition\ntowards his species and will drink with most of them. He is free with\nhis money, affable in his manners, innocent in his conversation--but\nthrough the placid stream of his life there glides an under-current\nof forefinger.\n\nTime and place cannot bind Mr. Bucket. Like man in the abstract, he\nis here to-day and gone to-morrow--but, very unlike man indeed, he is\nhere again the next day. This evening he will be casually looking\ninto the iron extinguishers at the door of Sir Leicester Dedlock's\nhouse in town; and to-morrow morning he will be walking on the leads\nat Chesney Wold, where erst the old man walked whose ghost is\npropitiated with a hundred guineas. Drawers, desks, pockets, all\nthings belonging to him, Mr. Bucket examines. A few hours afterwards,\nhe and the Roman will be alone together comparing forefingers.\n\nIt is likely that these occupations are irreconcilable with home\nenjoyment, but it is certain that Mr. Bucket at present does not go\nhome. Though in general he highly appreciates the society of Mrs.\nBucket--a lady of a natural detective genius, which if it had been\nimproved by professional exercise, might have done great things, but\nwhich has paused at the level of a clever amateur--he holds himself\naloof from that dear solace. Mrs. Bucket is dependent on their lodger\n(fortunately an amiable lady in whom she takes an interest) for\ncompanionship and conversation.\n\nA great crowd assembles in Lincoln's Inn Fields on the day of the\nfuneral. Sir Leicester Dedlock attends the ceremony in person;\nstrictly speaking, there are only three other human followers, that\nis to say, Lord Doodle, William Buffy, and the debilitated cousin\n(thrown in as a make-weight), but the amount of inconsolable\ncarriages is immense. The peerage contributes more four-wheeled\naffliction than has ever been seen in that neighbourhood. Such is the\nassemblage of armorial bearings on coach panels that the Herald's\nCollege might be supposed to have lost its father and mother at a\nblow. The Duke of Foodle sends a splendid pile of dust and ashes,\nwith silver wheel-boxes, patent axles, all the last improvements, and\nthree bereaved worms, six feet high, holding on behind, in a bunch of\nwoe. All the state coachmen in London seem plunged into mourning; and\nif that dead old man of the rusty garb be not beyond a taste in\nhorseflesh (which appears impossible), it must be highly gratified\nthis day.\n\nQuiet among the undertakers and the equipages and the calves of so\nmany legs all steeped in grief, Mr. Bucket sits concealed in one of\nthe inconsolable carriages and at his ease surveys the crowd through\nthe lattice blinds. He has a keen eye for a crowd--as for what\nnot?--and looking here and there, now from this side of the carriage,\nnow from the other, now up at the house windows, now along the\npeople's heads, nothing escapes him.\n\n\"And there you are, my partner, eh?\" says Mr. Bucket to himself,\napostrophizing Mrs. Bucket, stationed, by his favour, on the steps of\nthe deceased's house. \"And so you are. And so you are! And very well\nindeed you are looking, Mrs. Bucket!\"\n\nThe procession has not started yet, but is waiting for the cause of\nits assemblage to be brought out. Mr. Bucket, in the foremost\nemblazoned carriage, uses his two fat forefingers to hold the lattice\na hair's breadth open while he looks.\n\nAnd it says a great deal for his attachment, as a husband, that he is\nstill occupied with Mrs. B. \"There you are, my partner, eh?\" he\nmurmuringly repeats. \"And our lodger with you. I'm taking notice of\nyou, Mrs. Bucket; I hope you're all right in your health, my dear!\"\n\nNot another word does Mr. Bucket say, but sits with most attentive\neyes until the sacked depository of noble secrets is brought\ndown--Where are all those secrets now? Does he keep them yet? Did\nthey fly with him on that sudden journey?--and until the procession\nmoves, and Mr. Bucket's view is changed. After which he composes\nhimself for an easy ride and takes note of the fittings of the\ncarriage in case he should ever find such knowledge useful.\n\nContrast enough between Mr. Tulkinghorn shut up in his dark carriage\nand Mr. Bucket shut up in HIS. Between the immeasurable track of\nspace beyond the little wound that has thrown the one into the fixed\nsleep which jolts so heavily over the stones of the streets, and the\nnarrow track of blood which keeps the other in the watchful state\nexpressed in every hair of his head! But it is all one to both;\nneither is troubled about that.\n\nMr. Bucket sits out the procession in his own easy manner and glides\nfrom the carriage when the opportunity he has settled with himself\narrives. He makes for Sir Leicester Dedlock's, which is at present a\nsort of home to him, where he comes and goes as he likes at all\nhours, where he is always welcome and made much of, where he knows\nthe whole establishment, and walks in an atmosphere of mysterious\ngreatness.\n\nNo knocking or ringing for Mr. Bucket. He has caused himself to be\nprovided with a key and can pass in at his pleasure. As he is\ncrossing the hall, Mercury informs him, \"Here's another letter for\nyou, Mr. Bucket, come by post,\" and gives it him.\n\n\"Another one, eh?\" says Mr. Bucket.\n\nIf Mercury should chance to be possessed by any lingering curiosity\nas to Mr. Bucket's letters, that wary person is not the man to\ngratify it. Mr. Bucket looks at him as if his face were a vista of\nsome miles in length and he were leisurely contemplating the same.\n\n\"Do you happen to carry a box?\" says Mr. Bucket.\n\nUnfortunately Mercury is no snuff-taker.\n\n\"Could you fetch me a pinch from anywheres?\" says Mr. Bucket.\n\"Thankee. It don't matter what it is; I'm not particular as to the\nkind. Thankee!\"\n\nHaving leisurely helped himself from a canister borrowed from\nsomebody downstairs for the purpose, and having made a considerable\nshow of tasting it, first with one side of his nose and then with the\nother, Mr. Bucket, with much deliberation, pronounces it of the right\nsort and goes on, letter in hand.\n\nNow although Mr. Bucket walks upstairs to the little library within\nthe larger one with the face of a man who receives some scores of\nletters every day, it happens that much correspondence is not\nincidental to his life. He is no great scribe, rather handling his\npen like the pocket-staff he carries about with him always convenient\nto his grasp, and discourages correspondence with himself in others\nas being too artless and direct a way of doing delicate business.\nFurther, he often sees damaging letters produced in evidence and has\noccasion to reflect that it was a green thing to write them. For\nthese reasons he has very little to do with letters, either as sender\nor receiver. And yet he has received a round half-dozen within the\nlast twenty-four hours.\n\n\"And this,\" says Mr. Bucket, spreading it out on the table, \"is in\nthe same hand, and consists of the same two words.\"\n\nWhat two words?\n\nHe turns the key in the door, ungirdles his black pocket-book (book\nof fate to many), lays another letter by it, and reads, boldly\nwritten in each, \"Lady Dedlock.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes,\" says Mr. Bucket. \"But I could have made the money without\nthis anonymous information.\"\n\nHaving put the letters in his book of fate and girdled it up again,\nhe unlocks the door just in time to admit his dinner, which is\nbrought upon a goodly tray with a decanter of sherry. Mr. Bucket\nfrequently observes, in friendly circles where there is no restraint,\nthat he likes a toothful of your fine old brown East Inder sherry\nbetter than anything you can offer him. Consequently he fills and\nempties his glass with a smack of his lips and is proceeding with his\nrefreshment when an idea enters his mind.\n\nMr. Bucket softly opens the door of communication between that room\nand the next and looks in. The library is deserted, and the fire is\nsinking low. Mr. Bucket's eye, after taking a pigeon-flight round the\nroom, alights upon a table where letters are usually put as they\narrive. Several letters for Sir Leicester are upon it. Mr. Bucket\ndraws near and examines the directions. \"No,\" he says, \"there's none\nin that hand. It's only me as is written to. I can break it to Sir\nLeicester Dedlock, Baronet, to-morrow.\"\n\nWith that he returns to finish his dinner with a good appetite, and\nafter a light nap, is summoned into the drawing-room. Sir Leicester\nhas received him there these several evenings past to know whether he\nhas anything to report. The debilitated cousin (much exhausted by the\nfuneral) and Volumnia are in attendance.\n\nMr. Bucket makes three distinctly different bows to these three\npeople. A bow of homage to Sir Leicester, a bow of gallantry to\nVolumnia, and a bow of recognition to the debilitated Cousin, to whom\nit airily says, \"You are a swell about town, and you know me, and I\nknow you.\" Having distributed these little specimens of his tact, Mr.\nBucket rubs his hands.\n\n\"Have you anything new to communicate, officer?\" inquires Sir\nLeicester. \"Do you wish to hold any conversation with me in private?\"\n\n\"Why--not to-night, Sir Leicester Dedlock, Baronet.\"\n\n\"Because my time,\" pursues Sir Leicester, \"is wholly at your disposal\nwith a view to the vindication of the outraged majesty of the law.\"\n\nMr. Bucket coughs and glances at Volumnia, rouged and necklaced, as\nthough he would respectfully observe, \"I do assure you, you're a\npretty creetur. I've seen hundreds worse looking at your time of\nlife, I have indeed.\"\n\nThe fair Volumnia, not quite unconscious perhaps of the humanizing\ninfluence of her charms, pauses in the writing of cocked-hat notes\nand meditatively adjusts the pearl necklace. Mr. Bucket prices that\ndecoration in his mind and thinks it as likely as not that Volumnia\nis writing poetry.\n\n\"If I have not,\" pursues Sir Leicester, \"in the most emphatic manner,\nadjured you, officer, to exercise your utmost skill in this atrocious\ncase, I particularly desire to take the present opportunity of\nrectifying any omission I may have made. Let no expense be a\nconsideration. I am prepared to defray all charges. You can incur\nnone in pursuit of the object you have undertaken that I shall\nhesitate for a moment to bear.\"\n\nMr. Bucket made Sir Leicester's bow again as a response to this\nliberality.\n\n\"My mind,\" Sir Leicester adds with a generous warmth, \"has not, as\nmay be easily supposed, recovered its tone since the late diabolical\noccurrence. It is not likely ever to recover its tone. But it is full\nof indignation to-night after undergoing the ordeal of consigning to\nthe tomb the remains of a faithful, a zealous, a devoted adherent.\"\n\nSir Leicester's voice trembles and his grey hair stirs upon his head.\nTears are in his eyes; the best part of his nature is aroused.\n\n\"I declare,\" he says, \"I solemnly declare that until this crime is\ndiscovered and, in the course of justice, punished, I almost feel as\nif there were a stain upon my name. A gentleman who has devoted a\nlarge portion of his life to me, a gentleman who has devoted the last\nday of his life to me, a gentleman who has constantly sat at my table\nand slept under my roof, goes from my house to his own, and is struck\ndown within an hour of his leaving my house. I cannot say but that he\nmay have been followed from my house, watched at my house, even first\nmarked because of his association with my house--which may have\nsuggested his possessing greater wealth and being altogether of\ngreater importance than his own retiring demeanour would have\nindicated. If I cannot with my means and influence and my position\nbring all the perpetrators of such a crime to light, I fail in the\nassertion of my respect for that gentleman's memory and of my\nfidelity towards one who was ever faithful to me.\"\n\nWhile he makes this protestation with great emotion and earnestness,\nlooking round the room as if he were addressing an assembly, Mr.\nBucket glances at him with an observant gravity in which there might\nbe, but for the audacity of the thought, a touch of compassion.\n\n\"The ceremony of to-day,\" continues Sir Leicester, \"strikingly\nillustrative of the respect in which my deceased friend\"--he lays a\nstress upon the word, for death levels all distinctions--\"was held by\nthe flower of the land, has, I say, aggravated the shock I have\nreceived from this most horrible and audacious crime. If it were my\nbrother who had committed it, I would not spare him.\"\n\nMr. Bucket looks very grave. Volumnia remarks of the deceased that he\nwas the trustiest and dearest person!\n\n\"You must feel it as a deprivation to you, miss,\" replies Mr. Bucket\nsoothingly, \"no doubt. He was calculated to BE a deprivation, I'm\nsure he was.\"\n\nVolumnia gives Mr. Bucket to understand, in reply, that her sensitive\nmind is fully made up never to get the better of it as long as she\nlives, that her nerves are unstrung for ever, and that she has not\nthe least expectation of ever smiling again. Meanwhile she folds up a\ncocked hat for that redoubtable old general at Bath, descriptive of\nher melancholy condition.\n\n\"It gives a start to a delicate female,\" says Mr. Bucket\nsympathetically, \"but it'll wear off.\"\n\nVolumnia wishes of all things to know what is doing? Whether they are\ngoing to convict, or whatever it is, that dreadful soldier? Whether\nhe had any accomplices, or whatever the thing is called in the law?\nAnd a great deal more to the like artless purpose.\n\n\"Why you see, miss,\" returns Mr. Bucket, bringing the finger into\npersuasive action--and such is his natural gallantry that he had\nalmost said \"my dear\"--\"it ain't easy to answer those questions at\nthe present moment. Not at the present moment. I've kept myself on\nthis case, Sir Leicester Dedlock, Baronet,\" whom Mr. Bucket takes\ninto the conversation in right of his importance, \"morning, noon, and\nnight. But for a glass or two of sherry, I don't think I could have\nhad my mind so much upon the stretch as it has been. I COULD answer\nyour questions, miss, but duty forbids it. Sir Leicester Dedlock,\nBaronet, will very soon be made acquainted with all that has been\ntraced. And I hope that he may find it\"--Mr. Bucket again looks\ngrave--\"to his satisfaction.\"\n\nThe debilitated cousin only hopes some fler'll be executed--zample.\nThinks more interest's wanted--get man hanged presentime--than get\nman place ten thousand a year. Hasn't a doubt--zample--far better\nhang wrong fler than no fler.\n\n\"YOU know life, you know, sir,\" says Mr. Bucket with a complimentary\ntwinkle of his eye and crook of his finger, \"and you can confirm what\nI've mentioned to this lady. YOU don't want to be told that from\ninformation I have received I have gone to work. You're up to what a\nlady can't be expected to be up to. Lord! Especially in your elevated\nstation of society, miss,\" says Mr. Bucket, quite reddening at\nanother narrow escape from \"my dear.\"\n\n\"The officer, Volumnia,\" observes Sir Leicester, \"is faithful to his\nduty, and perfectly right.\"\n\nMr. Bucket murmurs, \"Glad to have the honour of your approbation, Sir\nLeicester Dedlock, Baronet.\"\n\n\"In fact, Volumnia,\" proceeds Sir Leicester, \"it is not holding up a\ngood model for imitation to ask the officer any such questions as you\nhave put to him. He is the best judge of his own responsibility; he\nacts upon his responsibility. And it does not become us, who assist\nin making the laws, to impede or interfere with those who carry them\ninto execution. Or,\" says Sir Leicester somewhat sternly, for\nVolumnia was going to cut in before he had rounded his sentence, \"or\nwho vindicate their outraged majesty.\"\n\nVolumnia with all humility explains that she had not merely the plea\nof curiosity to urge (in common with the giddy youth of her sex in\ngeneral) but that she is perfectly dying with regret and interest for\nthe darling man whose loss they all deplore.\n\n\"Very well, Volumnia,\" returns Sir Leicester. \"Then you cannot be too\ndiscreet.\"\n\nMr. Bucket takes the opportunity of a pause to be heard again.\n\n\"Sir Leicester Dedlock, Baronet, I have no objections to telling this\nlady, with your leave and among ourselves, that I look upon the case\nas pretty well complete. It is a beautiful case--a beautiful\ncase--and what little is wanting to complete it, I expect to be able\nto supply in a few hours.\"\n\n\"I am very glad indeed to hear it,\" says Sir Leicester. \"Highly\ncreditable to you.\"\n\n\"Sir Leicester Dedlock, Baronet,\" returns Mr. Bucket very seriously,\n\"I hope it may at one and the same time do me credit and prove\nsatisfactory to all. When I depict it as a beautiful case, you see,\nmiss,\" Mr. Bucket goes on, glancing gravely at Sir Leicester, \"I mean\nfrom my point of view. As considered from other points of view, such\ncases will always involve more or less unpleasantness. Very strange\nthings comes to our knowledge in families, miss; bless your heart,\nwhat you would think to be phenomenons, quite.\"\n\nVolumnia, with her innocent little scream, supposes so.\n\n\"Aye, and even in gen-teel families, in high families, in great\nfamilies,\" says Mr. Bucket, again gravely eyeing Sir Leicester aside.\n\"I have had the honour of being employed in high families before, and\nyou have no idea--come, I'll go so far as to say not even YOU have\nany idea, sir,\" this to the debilitated cousin, \"what games goes on!\"\n\nThe cousin, who has been casting sofa-pillows on his head, in a\nprostration of boredom yawns, \"Vayli,\" being the used-up for \"very\nlikely.\"\n\nSir Leicester, deeming it time to dismiss the officer, here\nmajestically interposes with the words, \"Very good. Thank you!\" and\nalso with a wave of his hand, implying not only that there is an end\nof the discourse, but that if high families fall into low habits they\nmust take the consequences. \"You will not forget, officer,\" he adds\nwith condescension, \"that I am at your disposal when you please.\"\n\nMr. Bucket (still grave) inquires if to-morrow morning, now, would\nsuit, in case he should be as for'ard as he expects to be. Sir\nLeicester replies, \"All times are alike to me.\" Mr. Bucket makes his\nthree bows and is withdrawing when a forgotten point occurs to him.\n\n\"Might I ask, by the by,\" he says in a low voice, cautiously\nreturning, \"who posted the reward-bill on the staircase.\"\n\n\"I ordered it to be put up there,\" replies Sir Leicester.\n\n\"Would it be considered a liberty, Sir Leicester Dedlock, Baronet, if\nI was to ask you why?\"\n\n\"Not at all. I chose it as a conspicuous part of the house. I think\nit cannot be too prominently kept before the whole establishment. I\nwish my people to be impressed with the enormity of the crime, the\ndetermination to punish it, and the hopelessness of escape. At the\nsame time, officer, if you in your better knowledge of the subject\nsee any objection--\"\n\nMr. Bucket sees none now; the bill having been put up, had better not\nbe taken down. Repeating his three bows he withdraws, closing the\ndoor on Volumnia's little scream, which is a preliminary to her\nremarking that that charmingly horrible person is a perfect Blue\nChamber.\n\nIn his fondness for society and his adaptability to all grades, Mr.\nBucket is presently standing before the hall-fire--bright and warm on\nthe early winter night--admiring Mercury.\n\n\"Why, you're six foot two, I suppose?\" says Mr. Bucket.\n\n\"Three,\" says Mercury.\n\n\"Are you so much? But then, you see, you're broad in proportion and\ndon't look it. You're not one of the weak-legged ones, you ain't. Was\nyou ever modelled now?\" Mr. Bucket asks, conveying the expression of\nan artist into the turn of his eye and head.\n\nMercury never was modelled.\n\n\"Then you ought to be, you know,\" says Mr. Bucket; \"and a friend of\nmine that you'll hear of one day as a Royal Academy sculptor would\nstand something handsome to make a drawing of your proportions for\nthe marble. My Lady's out, ain't she?\"\n\n\"Out to dinner.\"\n\n\"Goes out pretty well every day, don't she?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Not to be wondered at!\" says Mr. Bucket. \"Such a fine woman as her,\nso handsome and so graceful and so elegant, is like a fresh lemon on\na dinner-table, ornamental wherever she goes. Was your father in the\nsame way of life as yourself?\"\n\nAnswer in the negative.\n\n\"Mine was,\" says Mr. Bucket. \"My father was first a page, then a\nfootman, then a butler, then a steward, then an inn-keeper. Lived\nuniversally respected, and died lamented. Said with his last breath\nthat he considered service the most honourable part of his career,\nand so it was. I've a brother in service, AND a brother-in-law. My\nLady a good temper?\"\n\nMercury replies, \"As good as you can expect.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" says Mr. Bucket. \"A little spoilt? A little capricious? Lord!\nWhat can you anticipate when they're so handsome as that? And we like\n'em all the better for it, don't we?\"\n\nMercury, with his hands in the pockets of his bright peach-blossom\nsmall-clothes, stretches his symmetrical silk legs with the air of a\nman of gallantry and can't deny it. Come the roll of wheels and a\nviolent ringing at the bell. \"Talk of the angels,\" says Mr. Bucket.\n\"Here she is!\"\n\nThe doors are thrown open, and she passes through the hall. Still\nvery pale, she is dressed in slight mourning and wears two beautiful\nbracelets. Either their beauty or the beauty of her arms is\nparticularly attractive to Mr. Bucket. He looks at them with an eager\neye and rattles something in his pocket--halfpence perhaps.\n\nNoticing him at his distance, she turns an inquiring look on the\nother Mercury who has brought her home.\n\n\"Mr. Bucket, my Lady.\"\n\nMr. Bucket makes a leg and comes forward, passing his familiar demon\nover the region of his mouth.\n\n\"Are you waiting to see Sir Leicester?\"\n\n\"No, my Lady, I've seen him!\"\n\n\"Have you anything to say to me?\"\n\n\"Not just at present, my Lady.\"\n\n\"Have you made any new discoveries?\"\n\n\"A few, my Lady.\"\n\nThis is merely in passing. She scarcely makes a stop, and sweeps\nupstairs alone. Mr. Bucket, moving towards the staircase-foot,\nwatches her as she goes up the steps the old man came down to his\ngrave, past murderous groups of statuary repeated with their shadowy\nweapons on the wall, past the printed bill, which she looks at going\nby, out of view.\n\n\"She's a lovely woman, too, she really is,\" says Mr. Bucket, coming\nback to Mercury. \"Don't look quite healthy though.\"\n\nIs not quite healthy, Mercury informs him. Suffers much from\nheadaches.\n\nReally? That's a pity! Walking, Mr. Bucket would recommend for that.\nWell, she tries walking, Mercury rejoins. Walks sometimes for two\nhours when she has them bad. By night, too.\n\n\"Are you sure you're quite so much as six foot three?\" asks Mr.\nBucket. \"Begging your pardon for interrupting you a moment?\"\n\nNot a doubt about it.\n\n\"You're so well put together that I shouldn't have thought it. But\nthe household troops, though considered fine men, are built so\nstraggling. Walks by night, does she? When it's moonlight, though?\"\n\nOh, yes. When it's moonlight! Of course. Oh, of course!\nConversational and acquiescent on both sides.\n\n\"I suppose you ain't in the habit of walking yourself?\" says Mr.\nBucket. \"Not much time for it, I should say?\"\n\nBesides which, Mercury don't like it. Prefers carriage exercise.\n\n\"To be sure,\" says Mr. Bucket. \"That makes a difference. Now I think\nof it,\" says Mr. Bucket, warming his hands and looking pleasantly at\nthe blaze, \"she went out walking the very night of this business.\"\n\n\"To be sure she did! I let her into the garden over the way.\"\n\n\"And left her there. Certainly you did. I saw you doing it.\"\n\n\"I didn't see YOU,\" says Mercury.\n\n\"I was rather in a hurry,\" returns Mr. Bucket, \"for I was going to\nvisit a aunt of mine that lives at Chelsea--next door but two to the\nold original Bun House--ninety year old the old lady is, a single\nwoman, and got a little property. Yes, I chanced to be passing at the\ntime. Let's see. What time might it be? It wasn't ten.\"\n\n\"Half-past nine.\"\n\n\"You're right. So it was. And if I don't deceive myself, my Lady was\nmuffled in a loose black mantle, with a deep fringe to it?\"\n\n\"Of course she was.\"\n\nOf course she was. Mr. Bucket must return to a little work he has to\nget on with upstairs, but he must shake hands with Mercury in\nacknowledgment of his agreeable conversation, and will he--this is\nall he asks--will he, when he has a leisure half-hour, think of\nbestowing it on that Royal Academy sculptor, for the advantage of\nboth parties?\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LIV\n\nSpringing a Mine\n\n\nRefreshed by sleep, Mr. Bucket rises betimes in the morning and\nprepares for a field-day. Smartened up by the aid of a clean shirt\nand a wet hairbrush, with which instrument, on occasions of ceremony,\nhe lubricates such thin locks as remain to him after his life of\nsevere study, Mr. Bucket lays in a breakfast of two mutton chops as a\nfoundation to work upon, together with tea, eggs, toast, and\nmarmalade on a corresponding scale. Having much enjoyed these\nstrengthening matters and having held subtle conference with his\nfamiliar demon, he confidently instructs Mercury \"just to mention\nquietly to Sir Leicester Dedlock, Baronet, that whenever he's ready\nfor me, I'm ready for him.\" A gracious message being returned that\nSir Leicester will expedite his dressing and join Mr. Bucket in the\nlibrary within ten minutes, Mr. Bucket repairs to that apartment and\nstands before the fire with his finger on his chin, looking at the\nblazing coals.\n\nThoughtful Mr. Bucket is, as a man may be with weighty work to do,\nbut composed, sure, confident. From the expression of his face he\nmight be a famous whist-player for a large stake--say a hundred\nguineas certain--with the game in his hand, but with a high\nreputation involved in his playing his hand out to the last card in a\nmasterly way. Not in the least anxious or disturbed is Mr. Bucket\nwhen Sir Leicester appears, but he eyes the baronet aside as he comes\nslowly to his easy-chair with that observant gravity of yesterday in\nwhich there might have been yesterday, but for the audacity of the\nidea, a touch of compassion.\n\n\"I am sorry to have kept you waiting, officer, but I am rather later\nthan my usual hour this morning. I am not well. The agitation and the\nindignation from which I have recently suffered have been too much\nfor me. I am subject to--gout\"--Sir Leicester was going to say\nindisposition and would have said it to anybody else, but Mr. Bucket\npalpably knows all about it--\"and recent circumstances have brought\nit on.\"\n\nAs he takes his seat with some difficulty and with an air of pain,\nMr. Bucket draws a little nearer, standing with one of his large\nhands on the library-table.\n\n\"I am not aware, officer,\" Sir Leicester observes; raising his eyes\nto his face, \"whether you wish us to be alone, but that is entirely\nas you please. If you do, well and good. If not, Miss Dedlock would\nbe interested--\"\n\n\"Why, Sir Leicester Dedlock, Baronet,\" returns Mr. Bucket with his\nhead persuasively on one side and his forefinger pendant at one ear\nlike an earring, \"we can't be too private just at present. You will\npresently see that we can't be too private. A lady, under the\ncircumstances, and especially in Miss Dedlock's elevated station of\nsociety, can't but be agreeable to me, but speaking without a view to\nmyself, I will take the liberty of assuring you that I know we can't\nbe too private.\"\n\n\"That is enough.\"\n\n\"So much so, Sir Leicester Dedlock, Baronet,\" Mr. Bucket resumes,\n\"that I was on the point of asking your permission to turn the key in\nthe door.\"\n\n\"By all means.\" Mr. Bucket skilfully and softly takes that\nprecaution, stooping on his knee for a moment from mere force of\nhabit so to adjust the key in the lock as that no one shall peep in\nfrom the outerside.\n\n\"Sir Leicester Dedlock, Baronet, I mentioned yesterday evening that I\nwanted but a very little to complete this case. I have now completed\nit and collected proof against the person who did this crime.\"\n\n\"Against the soldier?\"\n\n\"No, Sir Leicester Dedlock; not the soldier.\"\n\nSir Leicester looks astounded and inquires, \"Is the man in custody?\"\n\nMr. Bucket tells him, after a pause, \"It was a woman.\"\n\nSir Leicester leans back in his chair, and breathlessly ejaculates,\n\"Good heaven!\"\n\n\"Now, Sir Leicester Dedlock, Baronet,\" Mr. Bucket begins, standing\nover him with one hand spread out on the library-table and the\nforefinger of the other in impressive use, \"it's my duty to prepare\nyou for a train of circumstances that may, and I go so far as to say\nthat will, give you a shock. But Sir Leicester Dedlock, Baronet, you\nare a gentleman, and I know what a gentleman is and what a gentleman\nis capable of. A gentleman can bear a shock when it must come, boldly\nand steadily. A gentleman can make up his mind to stand up against\nalmost any blow. Why, take yourself, Sir Leicester Dedlock, Baronet.\nIf there's a blow to be inflicted on you, you naturally think of your\nfamily. You ask yourself, how would all them ancestors of yours, away\nto Julius Caesar--not to go beyond him at present--have borne that\nblow; you remember scores of them that would have borne it well; and\nyou bear it well on their accounts, and to maintain the family\ncredit. That's the way you argue, and that's the way you act, Sir\nLeicester Dedlock, Baronet.\"\n\nSir Leicester, leaning back in his chair and grasping the elbows,\nsits looking at him with a stony face.\n\n\"Now, Sir Leicester Dedlock,\" proceeds Mr. Bucket, \"thus preparing\nyou, let me beg of you not to trouble your mind for a moment as to\nanything having come to MY knowledge. I know so much about so many\ncharacters, high and low, that a piece of information more or less\ndon't signify a straw. I don't suppose there's a move on the board\nthat would surprise ME, and as to this or that move having taken\nplace, why my knowing it is no odds at all, any possible move\nwhatever (provided it's in a wrong direction) being a probable move\naccording to my experience. Therefore, what I say to you, Sir\nLeicester Dedlock, Baronet, is, don't you go and let yourself be put\nout of the way because of my knowing anything of your family\naffairs.\"\n\n\"I thank you for your preparation,\" returns Sir Leicester after a\nsilence, without moving hand, foot, or feature, \"which I hope is not\nnecessary; though I give it credit for being well intended. Be so\ngood as to go on. Also\"--Sir Leicester seems to shrink in the shadow\nof his figure--\"also, to take a seat, if you have no objection.\"\n\nNone at all. Mr. Bucket brings a chair and diminishes his shadow.\n\"Now, Sir Leicester Dedlock, Baronet, with this short preface I come\nto the point. Lady Dedlock--\"\n\nSir Leicester raises himself in his seat and stares at him fiercely.\nMr. Bucket brings the finger into play as an emollient.\n\n\"Lady Dedlock, you see she's universally admired. That's what her\nladyship is; she's universally admired,\" says Mr. Bucket.\n\n\"I would greatly prefer, officer,\" Sir Leicester returns stiffly, \"my\nLady's name being entirely omitted from this discussion.\"\n\n\"So would I, Sir Leicester Dedlock, Baronet, but--it's impossible.\"\n\n\"Impossible?\"\n\nMr. Bucket shakes his relentless head.\n\n\"Sir Leicester Dedlock, Baronet, it's altogether impossible. What I\nhave got to say is about her ladyship. She is the pivot it all turns\non.\"\n\n\"Officer,\" retorts Sir Leicester with a fiery eye and a quivering\nlip, \"you know your duty. Do your duty, but be careful not to\noverstep it. I would not suffer it. I would not endure it. You bring\nmy Lady's name into this communication upon your responsibility--upon\nyour responsibility. My Lady's name is not a name for common persons\nto trifle with!\"\n\n\"Sir Leicester Dedlock, Baronet, I say what I must say, and no more.\"\n\n\"I hope it may prove so. Very well. Go on. Go on, sir!\" Glancing at\nthe angry eyes which now avoid him and at the angry figure trembling\nfrom head to foot, yet striving to be still, Mr. Bucket feels his way\nwith his forefinger and in a low voice proceeds.\n\n\"Sir Leicester Dedlock, Baronet, it becomes my duty to tell you that\nthe deceased Mr. Tulkinghorn long entertained mistrusts and\nsuspicions of Lady Dedlock.\"\n\n\"If he had dared to breathe them to me, sir--which he never did--I\nwould have killed him myself!\" exclaims Sir Leicester, striking his\nhand upon the table. But in the very heat and fury of the act he\nstops, fixed by the knowing eyes of Mr. Bucket, whose forefinger is\nslowly going and who, with mingled confidence and patience, shakes\nhis head.\n\n\"Sir Leicester Dedlock, the deceased Mr. Tulkinghorn was deep and\nclose, and what he fully had in his mind in the very beginning I\ncan't quite take upon myself to say. But I know from his lips that he\nlong ago suspected Lady Dedlock of having discovered, through the\nsight of some handwriting--in this very house, and when you yourself,\nSir Leicester Dedlock, were present--the existence, in great poverty,\nof a certain person who had been her lover before you courted her and\nwho ought to have been her husband.\" Mr. Bucket stops and\ndeliberately repeats, \"Ought to have been her husband, not a doubt\nabout it. I know from his lips that when that person soon afterwards\ndied, he suspected Lady Dedlock of visiting his wretched lodging and\nhis wretched grave, alone and in secret. I know from my own inquiries\nand through my eyes and ears that Lady Dedlock did make such visit in\nthe dress of her own maid, for the deceased Mr. Tulkinghorn employed\nme to reckon up her ladyship--if you'll excuse my making use of the\nterm we commonly employ--and I reckoned her up, so far, completely. I\nconfronted the maid in the chambers in Lincoln's Inn Fields with a\nwitness who had been Lady Dedlock's guide, and there couldn't be the\nshadow of a doubt that she had worn the young woman's dress, unknown\nto her. Sir Leicester Dedlock, Baronet, I did endeavour to pave the\nway a little towards these unpleasant disclosures yesterday by saying\nthat very strange things happened even in high families sometimes.\nAll this, and more, has happened in your own family, and to and\nthrough your own Lady. It's my belief that the deceased Mr.\nTulkinghorn followed up these inquiries to the hour of his death and\nthat he and Lady Dedlock even had bad blood between them upon the\nmatter that very night. Now, only you put that to Lady Dedlock, Sir\nLeicester Dedlock, Baronet, and ask her ladyship whether, even after\nhe had left here, she didn't go down to his chambers with the\nintention of saying something further to him, dressed in a loose\nblack mantle with a deep fringe to it.\"\n\nSir Leicester sits like a statue, gazing at the cruel finger that is\nprobing the life-blood of his heart.\n\n\"You put that to her ladyship, Sir Leicester Dedlock, Baronet, from\nme, Inspector Bucket of the Detective. And if her ladyship makes any\ndifficulty about admitting of it, you tell her that it's no use, that\nInspector Bucket knows it and knows that she passed the soldier as\nyou called him (though he's not in the army now) and knows that she\nknows she passed him on the staircase. Now, Sir Leicester Dedlock,\nBaronet, why do I relate all this?\"\n\nSir Leicester, who has covered his face with his hands, uttering a\nsingle groan, requests him to pause for a moment. By and by he takes\nhis hands away, and so preserves his dignity and outward calmness,\nthough there is no more colour in his face than in his white hair,\nthat Mr. Bucket is a little awed by him. Something frozen and fixed\nis upon his manner, over and above its usual shell of haughtiness,\nand Mr. Bucket soon detects an unusual slowness in his speech, with\nnow and then a curious trouble in beginning, which occasions him to\nutter inarticulate sounds. With such sounds he now breaks silence,\nsoon, however, controlling himself to say that he does not comprehend\nwhy a gentleman so faithful and zealous as the late Mr. Tulkinghorn\nshould have communicated to him nothing of this painful, this\ndistressing, this unlooked-for, this overwhelming, this incredible\nintelligence.\n\n\"Again, Sir Leicester Dedlock, Baronet,\" returns Mr. Bucket, \"put it\nto her ladyship to clear that up. Put it to her ladyship, if you\nthink it right, from Inspector Bucket of the Detective. You'll find,\nor I'm much mistaken, that the deceased Mr. Tulkinghorn had the\nintention of communicating the whole to you as soon as he considered\nit ripe, and further, that he had given her ladyship so to\nunderstand. Why, he might have been going to reveal it the very\nmorning when I examined the body! You don't know what I'm going to\nsay and do five minutes from this present time, Sir Leicester\nDedlock, Baronet; and supposing I was to be picked off now, you might\nwonder why I hadn't done it, don't you see?\"\n\nTrue. Sir Leicester, avoiding, with some trouble those obtrusive\nsounds, says, \"True.\" At this juncture a considerable noise of voices\nis heard in the hall. Mr. Bucket, after listening, goes to the\nlibrary-door, softly unlocks and opens it, and listens again. Then he\ndraws in his head and whispers hurriedly but composedly, \"Sir\nLeicester Dedlock, Baronet, this unfortunate family affair has taken\nair, as I expected it might, the deceased Mr. Tulkinghorn being cut\ndown so sudden. The chance to hush it is to let in these people now\nin a wrangle with your footmen. Would you mind sitting quiet--on the\nfamily account--while I reckon 'em up? And would you just throw in a\nnod when I seem to ask you for it?\"\n\nSir Leicester indistinctly answers, \"Officer. The best you can, the\nbest you can!\" and Mr. Bucket, with a nod and a sagacious crook of\nthe forefinger, slips down into the hall, where the voices quickly\ndie away. He is not long in returning; a few paces ahead of Mercury\nand a brother deity also powdered and in peach-blossomed smalls, who\nbear between them a chair in which is an incapable old man. Another\nman and two women come behind. Directing the pitching of the chair in\nan affable and easy manner, Mr. Bucket dismisses the Mercuries and\nlocks the door again. Sir Leicester looks on at this invasion of the\nsacred precincts with an icy stare.\n\n\"Now, perhaps you may know me, ladies and gentlemen,\" says Mr. Bucket\nin a confidential voice. \"I am Inspector Bucket of the Detective, I\nam; and this,\" producing the tip of his convenient little staff from\nhis breast-pocket, \"is my authority. Now, you wanted to see Sir\nLeicester Dedlock, Baronet. Well! You do see him, and mind you, it\nain't every one as is admitted to that honour. Your name, old\ngentleman, is Smallweed; that's what your name is; I know it well.\"\n\n\"Well, and you never heard any harm of it!\" cries Mr. Smallweed in a\nshrill loud voice.\n\n\"You don't happen to know why they killed the pig, do you?\" retorts\nMr. Bucket with a steadfast look, but without loss of temper.\n\n\"No!\"\n\n\"Why, they killed him,\" says Mr. Bucket, \"on account of his having so\nmuch cheek. Don't YOU get into the same position, because it isn't\nworthy of you. You ain't in the habit of conversing with a deaf\nperson, are you?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" snarls Mr. Smallweed, \"my wife's deaf.\"\n\n\"That accounts for your pitching your voice so high. But as she ain't\nhere; just pitch it an octave or two lower, will you, and I'll not\nonly be obliged to you, but it'll do you more credit,\" says Mr.\nBucket. \"This other gentleman is in the preaching line, I think?\"\n\n\"Name of Chadband,\" Mr. Smallweed puts in, speaking henceforth in a\nmuch lower key.\n\n\"Once had a friend and brother serjeant of the same name,\" says Mr.\nBucket, offering his hand, \"and consequently feel a liking for it.\nMrs. Chadband, no doubt?\"\n\n\"And Mrs. Snagsby,\" Mr. Smallweed introduces.\n\n\"Husband a law-stationer and a friend of my own,\" says Mr. Bucket.\n\"Love him like a brother! Now, what's up?\"\n\n\"Do you mean what business have we come upon?\" Mr. Smallweed asks, a\nlittle dashed by the suddenness of this turn.\n\n\"Ah! You know what I mean. Let us hear what it's all about in\npresence of Sir Leicester Dedlock, Baronet. Come.\"\n\nMr. Smallweed, beckoning Mr. Chadband, takes a moment's counsel with\nhim in a whisper. Mr. Chadband, expressing a considerable amount of\noil from the pores of his forehead and the palms of his hands, says\naloud, \"Yes. You first!\" and retires to his former place.\n\n\"I was the client and friend of Mr. Tulkinghorn,\" pipes Grandfather\nSmallweed then; \"I did business with him. I was useful to him, and he\nwas useful to me. Krook, dead and gone, was my brother-in-law. He was\nown brother to a brimstone magpie--leastways Mrs. Smallweed. I come\ninto Krook's property. I examined all his papers and all his effects.\nThey was all dug out under my eyes. There was a bundle of letters\nbelonging to a dead and gone lodger as was hid away at the back of a\nshelf in the side of Lady Jane's bed--his cat's bed. He hid all\nmanner of things away, everywheres. Mr. Tulkinghorn wanted 'em and\ngot 'em, but I looked 'em over first. I'm a man of business, and I\ntook a squint at 'em. They was letters from the lodger's sweetheart,\nand she signed Honoria. Dear me, that's not a common name, Honoria,\nis it? There's no lady in this house that signs Honoria is there? Oh,\nno, I don't think so! Oh, no, I don't think so! And not in the same\nhand, perhaps? Oh, no, I don't think so!\"\n\nHere Mr. Smallweed, seized with a fit of coughing in the midst of his\ntriumph, breaks off to ejaculate, \"Oh, dear me! Oh, Lord! I'm shaken\nall to pieces!\"\n\n\"Now, when you're ready,\" says Mr. Bucket after awaiting his\nrecovery, \"to come to anything that concerns Sir Leicester Dedlock,\nBaronet, here the gentleman sits, you know.\"\n\n\"Haven't I come to it, Mr. Bucket?\" cries Grandfather Smallweed.\n\"Isn't the gentleman concerned yet? Not with Captain Hawdon, and his\never affectionate Honoria, and their child into the bargain? Come,\nthen, I want to know where those letters are. That concerns me, if it\ndon't concern Sir Leicester Dedlock. I will know where they are. I\nwon't have 'em disappear so quietly. I handed 'em over to my friend\nand solicitor, Mr. Tulkinghorn, not to anybody else.\"\n\n\"Why, he paid you for them, you know, and handsome too,\" says Mr.\nBucket.\n\n\"I don't care for that. I want to know who's got 'em. And I tell you\nwhat we want--what we all here want, Mr. Bucket. We want more\npainstaking and search-making into this murder. We know where the\ninterest and the motive was, and you have not done enough. If George\nthe vagabond dragoon had any hand in it, he was only an accomplice,\nand was set on. You know what I mean as well as any man.\"\n\n\"Now I tell you what,\" says Mr. Bucket, instantaneously altering his\nmanner, coming close to him, and communicating an extraordinary\nfascination to the forefinger, \"I am damned if I am a-going to have\nmy case spoilt, or interfered with, or anticipated by so much as half\na second of time by any human being in creation. YOU want more\npainstaking and search-making! YOU do? Do you see this hand, and do\nyou think that I don't know the right time to stretch it out and put\nit on the arm that fired that shot?\"\n\nSuch is the dread power of the man, and so terribly evident it is\nthat he makes no idle boast, that Mr. Smallweed begins to apologize.\nMr. Bucket, dismissing his sudden anger, checks him.\n\n\"The advice I give you is, don't you trouble your head about the\nmurder. That's my affair. You keep half an eye on the newspapers, and\nI shouldn't wonder if you was to read something about it before long,\nif you look sharp. I know my business, and that's all I've got to say\nto you on that subject. Now about those letters. You want to know\nwho's got 'em. I don't mind telling you. I have got 'em. Is that the\npacket?\"\n\nMr. Smallweed looks, with greedy eyes, at the little bundle Mr.\nBucket produces from a mysterious part of his coat, and identifies it\nas the same.\n\n\"What have you got to say next?\" asks Mr. Bucket. \"Now, don't open\nyour mouth too wide, because you don't look handsome when you do it.\"\n\n\"I want five hundred pound.\"\n\n\"No, you don't; you mean fifty,\" says Mr. Bucket humorously.\n\nIt appears, however, that Mr. Smallweed means five hundred.\n\n\"That is, I am deputed by Sir Leicester Dedlock, Baronet, to consider\n(without admitting or promising anything) this bit of business,\" says\nMr. Bucket--Sir Leicester mechanically bows his head--\"and you ask me\nto consider a proposal of five hundred pounds. Why, it's an\nunreasonable proposal! Two fifty would be bad enough, but better than\nthat. Hadn't you better say two fifty?\"\n\nMr. Smallweed is quite clear that he had better not.\n\n\"Then,\" says Mr. Bucket, \"let's hear Mr. Chadband. Lord! Many a time\nI've heard my old fellow-serjeant of that name; and a moderate man he\nwas in all respects, as ever I come across!\"\n\nThus invited, Mr. Chadband steps forth, and after a little sleek\nsmiling and a little oil-grinding with the palms of his hands,\ndelivers himself as follows, \"My friends, we are now--Rachael, my\nwife, and I--in the mansions of the rich and great. Why are we now in\nthe mansions of the rich and great, my friends? Is it because we are\ninvited? Because we are bidden to feast with them, because we are\nbidden to rejoice with them, because we are bidden to play the lute\nwith them, because we are bidden to dance with them? No. Then why are\nwe here, my friends? Air we in possession of a sinful secret, and do\nwe require corn, and wine, and oil, or what is much the same thing,\nmoney, for the keeping thereof? Probably so, my friends.\"\n\n\"You're a man of business, you are,\" returns Mr. Bucket, very\nattentive, \"and consequently you're going on to mention what the\nnature of your secret is. You are right. You couldn't do better.\"\n\n\"Let us then, my brother, in a spirit of love,\" says Mr. Chadband\nwith a cunning eye, \"proceed unto it. Rachael, my wife, advance!\"\n\nMrs. Chadband, more than ready, so advances as to jostle her husband\ninto the background and confronts Mr. Bucket with a hard, frowning\nsmile.\n\n\"Since you want to know what we know,\" says she, \"I'll tell you. I\nhelped to bring up Miss Hawdon, her ladyship's daughter. I was in the\nservice of her ladyship's sister, who was very sensitive to the\ndisgrace her ladyship brought upon her, and gave out, even to her\nladyship, that the child was dead--she WAS very nearly so--when she\nwas born. But she's alive, and I know her.\" With these words, and a\nlaugh, and laying a bitter stress on the word \"ladyship,\" Mrs.\nChadband folds her arms and looks implacably at Mr. Bucket.\n\n\"I suppose now,\" returns that officer, \"YOU will be expecting a\ntwenty-pound note or a present of about that figure?\"\n\nMrs. Chadband merely laughs and contemptuously tells him he can\n\"offer\" twenty pence.\n\n\"My friend the law-stationer's good lady, over there,\" says Mr.\nBucket, luring Mrs. Snagsby forward with the finger. \"What may YOUR\ngame be, ma'am?\"\n\nMrs. Snagsby is at first prevented, by tears and lamentations, from\nstating the nature of her game, but by degrees it confusedly comes to\nlight that she is a woman overwhelmed with injuries and wrongs, whom\nMr. Snagsby has habitually deceived, abandoned, and sought to keep in\ndarkness, and whose chief comfort, under her afflictions, has been\nthe sympathy of the late Mr. Tulkinghorn, who showed so much\ncommiseration for her on one occasion of his calling in Cook's Court\nin the absence of her perjured husband that she has of late\nhabitually carried to him all her woes. Everybody it appears, the\npresent company excepted, has plotted against Mrs. Snagsby's peace.\nThere is Mr. Guppy, clerk to Kenge and Carboy, who was at first as\nopen as the sun at noon, but who suddenly shut up as close as\nmidnight, under the influence--no doubt--of Mr. Snagsby's suborning\nand tampering. There is Mr. Weevle, friend of Mr. Guppy, who lived\nmysteriously up a court, owing to the like coherent causes. There was\nKrook, deceased; there was Nimrod, deceased; and there was Jo,\ndeceased; and they were \"all in it.\" In what, Mrs. Snagsby does not\nwith particularity express, but she knows that Jo was Mr. Snagsby's\nson, \"as well as if a trumpet had spoken it,\" and she followed Mr.\nSnagsby when he went on his last visit to the boy, and if he was not\nhis son why did he go? The one occupation of her life has been, for\nsome time back, to follow Mr. Snagsby to and fro, and up and down,\nand to piece suspicious circumstances together--and every\ncircumstance that has happened has been most suspicious; and in this\nway she has pursued her object of detecting and confounding her false\nhusband, night and day. Thus did it come to pass that she brought the\nChadbands and Mr. Tulkinghorn together, and conferred with Mr.\nTulkinghorn on the change in Mr. Guppy, and helped to turn up the\ncircumstances in which the present company are interested, casually,\nby the wayside, being still and ever on the great high road that is\nto terminate in Mr. Snagsby's full exposure and a matrimonial\nseparation. All this, Mrs. Snagsby, as an injured woman, and the\nfriend of Mrs. Chadband, and the follower of Mr. Chadband, and the\nmourner of the late Mr. Tulkinghorn, is here to certify under the\nseal of confidence, with every possible confusion and involvement\npossible and impossible, having no pecuniary motive whatever, no\nscheme or project but the one mentioned, and bringing here, and\ntaking everywhere, her own dense atmosphere of dust, arising from the\nceaseless working of her mill of jealousy.\n\nWhile this exordium is in hand--and it takes some time--Mr. Bucket,\nwho has seen through the transparency of Mrs. Snagsby's vinegar at a\nglance, confers with his familiar demon and bestows his shrewd\nattention on the Chadbands and Mr. Smallweed. Sir Leicester Dedlock\nremains immovable, with the same icy surface upon him, except that he\nonce or twice looks towards Mr. Bucket, as relying on that officer\nalone of all mankind.\n\n\"Very good,\" says Mr. Bucket. \"Now I understand you, you know, and\nbeing deputed by Sir Leicester Dedlock, Baronet, to look into this\nlittle matter,\" again Sir Leicester mechanically bows in confirmation\nof the statement, \"can give it my fair and full attention. Now I\nwon't allude to conspiring to extort money or anything of that sort,\nbecause we are men and women of the world here, and our object is to\nmake things pleasant. But I tell you what I DO wonder at; I am\nsurprised that you should think of making a noise below in the hall.\nIt was so opposed to your interests. That's what I look at.\"\n\n\"We wanted to get in,\" pleads Mr. Smallweed.\n\n\"Why, of course you wanted to get in,\" Mr. Bucket asserts with\ncheerfulness; \"but for a old gentleman at your time of life--what I\ncall truly venerable, mind you!--with his wits sharpened, as I have\nno doubt they are, by the loss of the use of his limbs, which\noccasions all his animation to mount up into his head, not to\nconsider that if he don't keep such a business as the present as\nclose as possible it can't be worth a mag to him, is so curious! You\nsee your temper got the better of you; that's where you lost ground,\"\nsays Mr. Bucket in an argumentative and friendly way.\n\n\"I only said I wouldn't go without one of the servants came up to Sir\nLeicester Dedlock,\" returns Mr. Smallweed.\n\n\"That's it! That's where your temper got the better of you. Now, you\nkeep it under another time and you'll make money by it. Shall I ring\nfor them to carry you down?\"\n\n\"When are we to hear more of this?\" Mrs. Chadband sternly demands.\n\n\"Bless your heart for a true woman! Always curious, your delightful\nsex is!\" replies Mr. Bucket with gallantry. \"I shall have the\npleasure of giving you a call to-morrow or next day--not forgetting\nMr. Smallweed and his proposal of two fifty.\"\n\n\"Five hundred!\" exclaims Mr. Smallweed.\n\n\"All right! Nominally five hundred.\" Mr. Bucket has his hand on the\nbell-rope. \"SHALL I wish you good day for the present on the part of\nmyself and the gentleman of the house?\" he asks in an insinuating\ntone.\n\nNobody having the hardihood to object to his doing so, he does it,\nand the party retire as they came up. Mr. Bucket follows them to the\ndoor, and returning, says with an air of serious business, \"Sir\nLeicester Dedlock, Baronet, it's for you to consider whether or not\nto buy this up. I should recommend, on the whole, it's being bought\nup myself; and I think it may be bought pretty cheap. You see, that\nlittle pickled cowcumber of a Mrs. Snagsby has been used by all sides\nof the speculation and has done a deal more harm in bringing odds and\nends together than if she had meant it. Mr. Tulkinghorn, deceased, he\nheld all these horses in his hand and could have drove 'em his own\nway, I haven't a doubt; but he was fetched off the box head-foremost,\nand now they have got their legs over the traces, and are all\ndragging and pulling their own ways. So it is, and such is life. The\ncat's away, and the mice they play; the frost breaks up, and the\nwater runs. Now, with regard to the party to be apprehended.\"\n\nSir Leicester seems to wake, though his eyes have been wide open, and\nhe looks intently at Mr. Bucket as Mr. Bucket refers to his watch.\n\n\"The party to be apprehended is now in this house,\" proceeds Mr.\nBucket, putting up his watch with a steady hand and with rising\nspirits, \"and I'm about to take her into custody in your presence.\nSir Leicester Dedlock, Baronet, don't you say a word nor yet stir.\nThere'll be no noise and no disturbance at all. I'll come back in the\ncourse of the evening, if agreeable to you, and endeavour to meet\nyour wishes respecting this unfortunate family matter and the\nnobbiest way of keeping it quiet. Now, Sir Leicester Dedlock,\nBaronet, don't you be nervous on account of the apprehension at\npresent coming off. You shall see the whole case clear, from first to\nlast.\"\n\nMr. Bucket rings, goes to the door, briefly whispers Mercury, shuts\nthe door, and stands behind it with his arms folded. After a suspense\nof a minute or two the door slowly opens and a Frenchwoman enters.\nMademoiselle Hortense.\n\nThe moment she is in the room Mr. Bucket claps the door to and puts\nhis back against it. The suddenness of the noise occasions her to\nturn, and then for the first time she sees Sir Leicester Dedlock in\nhis chair.\n\n\"I ask you pardon,\" she mutters hurriedly. \"They tell me there was no\none here.\"\n\nHer step towards the door brings her front to front with Mr. Bucket.\nSuddenly a spasm shoots across her face and she turns deadly pale.\n\n\"This is my lodger, Sir Leicester Dedlock,\" says Mr. Bucket, nodding\nat her. \"This foreign young woman has been my lodger for some weeks\nback.\"\n\n\"What do Sir Leicester care for that, you think, my angel?\" returns\nmademoiselle in a jocular strain.\n\n\"Why, my angel,\" returns Mr. Bucket, \"we shall see.\"\n\nMademoiselle Hortense eyes him with a scowl upon her tight face,\nwhich gradually changes into a smile of scorn, \"You are very\nmysterieuse. Are you drunk?\"\n\n\"Tolerable sober, my angel,\" returns Mr. Bucket.\n\n\"I come from arriving at this so detestable house with your wife.\nYour wife have left me since some minutes. They tell me downstairs\nthat your wife is here. I come here, and your wife is not here. What\nis the intention of this fool's play, say then?\" mademoiselle\ndemands, with her arms composedly crossed, but with something in her\ndark cheek beating like a clock.\n\nMr. Bucket merely shakes the finger at her.\n\n\"Ah, my God, you are an unhappy idiot!\" cries mademoiselle with a\ntoss of her head and a laugh. \"Leave me to pass downstairs, great\npig.\" With a stamp of her foot and a menace.\n\n\"Now, mademoiselle,\" says Mr. Bucket in a cool determined way, \"you\ngo and sit down upon that sofy.\"\n\n\"I will not sit down upon nothing,\" she replies with a shower of\nnods.\n\n\"Now, mademoiselle,\" repeats Mr. Bucket, making no demonstration\nexcept with the finger, \"you sit down upon that sofy.\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"Because I take you into custody on a charge of murder, and you don't\nneed to be told it. Now, I want to be polite to one of your sex and a\nforeigner if I can. If I can't, I must be rough, and there's rougher\nones outside. What I am to be depends on you. So I recommend you, as\na friend, afore another half a blessed moment has passed over your\nhead, to go and sit down upon that sofy.\"\n\nMademoiselle complies, saying in a concentrated voice while that\nsomething in her cheek beats fast and hard, \"You are a devil.\"\n\n\"Now, you see,\" Mr. Bucket proceeds approvingly, \"you're comfortable\nand conducting yourself as I should expect a foreign young woman of\nyour sense to do. So I'll give you a piece of advice, and it's this,\ndon't you talk too much. You're not expected to say anything here,\nand you can't keep too quiet a tongue in your head. In short, the\nless you PARLAY, the better, you know.\" Mr. Bucket is very complacent\nover this French explanation.\n\nMademoiselle, with that tigerish expansion of the mouth and her black\neyes darting fire upon him, sits upright on the sofa in a rigid\nstate, with her hands clenched--and her feet too, one might\nsuppose--muttering, \"Oh, you Bucket, you are a devil!\"\n\n\"Now, Sir Leicester Dedlock, Baronet,\" says Mr. Bucket, and from this\ntime forth the finger never rests, \"this young woman, my lodger, was\nher ladyship's maid at the time I have mentioned to you; and this\nyoung woman, besides being extraordinary vehement and passionate\nagainst her ladyship after being discharged--\"\n\n\"Lie!\" cries mademoiselle. \"I discharge myself.\"\n\n\"Now, why don't you take my advice?\" returns Mr. Bucket in an\nimpressive, almost in an imploring, tone. \"I'm surprised at the\nindiscreetness you commit. You'll say something that'll be used\nagainst you, you know. You're sure to come to it. Never you mind what\nI say till it's given in evidence. It is not addressed to you.\"\n\n\"Discharge, too,\" cries mademoiselle furiously, \"by her ladyship! Eh,\nmy faith, a pretty ladyship! Why, I r-r-r-ruin my character by\nremaining with a ladyship so infame!\"\n\n\"Upon my soul I wonder at you!\" Mr. Bucket remonstrates. \"I thought\nthe French were a polite nation, I did, really. Yet to hear a female\ngoing on like that before Sir Leicester Dedlock, Baronet!\"\n\n\"He is a poor abused!\" cries mademoiselle. \"I spit upon his house,\nupon his name, upon his imbecility,\" all of which she makes the\ncarpet represent. \"Oh, that he is a great man! Oh, yes, superb! Oh,\nheaven! Bah!\"\n\n\"Well, Sir Leicester Dedlock,\" proceeds Mr. Bucket, \"this intemperate\nforeigner also angrily took it into her head that she had established\na claim upon Mr. Tulkinghorn, deceased, by attending on the occasion\nI told you of at his chambers, though she was liberally paid for her\ntime and trouble.\"\n\n\"Lie!\" cries mademoiselle. \"I ref-use his money all togezzer.\"\n\n\"If you WILL PARLAY, you know,\" says Mr. Bucket parenthetically, \"you\nmust take the consequences. Now, whether she became my lodger, Sir\nLeicester Dedlock, with any deliberate intention then of doing this\ndeed and blinding me, I give no opinion on; but she lived in my house\nin that capacity at the time that she was hovering about the chambers\nof the deceased Mr. Tulkinghorn with a view to a wrangle, and\nlikewise persecuting and half frightening the life out of an\nunfortunate stationer.\"\n\n\"Lie!\" cries mademoiselle. \"All lie!\"\n\n\"The murder was committed, Sir Leicester Dedlock, Baronet, and you\nknow under what circumstances. Now, I beg of you to follow me close\nwith your attention for a minute or two. I was sent for, and the case\nwas entrusted to me. I examined the place, and the body, and the\npapers, and everything. From information I received (from a clerk in\nthe same house) I took George into custody as having been seen\nhanging about there on the night, and at very nigh the time of the\nmurder, also as having been overheard in high words with the deceased\non former occasions--even threatening him, as the witness made out.\nIf you ask me, Sir Leicester Dedlock, whether from the first I\nbelieved George to be the murderer, I tell you candidly no, but he\nmight be, notwithstanding, and there was enough against him to make\nit my duty to take him and get him kept under remand. Now, observe!\"\n\nAs Mr. Bucket bends forward in some excitement--for him--and\ninaugurates what he is going to say with one ghostly beat of his\nforefinger in the air, Mademoiselle Hortense fixes her black eyes\nupon him with a dark frown and sets her dry lips closely and firmly\ntogether.\n\n\"I went home, Sir Leicester Dedlock, Baronet, at night and found this\nyoung woman having supper with my wife, Mrs. Bucket. She had made a\nmighty show of being fond of Mrs. Bucket from her first offering\nherself as our lodger, but that night she made more than ever--in\nfact, overdid it. Likewise she overdid her respect, and all that, for\nthe lamented memory of the deceased Mr. Tulkinghorn. By the living\nLord it flashed upon me, as I sat opposite to her at the table and\nsaw her with a knife in her hand, that she had done it!\"\n\nMademoiselle is hardly audible in straining through her teeth and\nlips the words, \"You are a devil.\"\n\n\"Now where,\" pursues Mr. Bucket, \"had she been on the night of the\nmurder? She had been to the theayter. (She really was there, I have\nsince found, both before the deed and after it.) I knew I had an\nartful customer to deal with and that proof would be very difficult;\nand I laid a trap for her--such a trap as I never laid yet, and such\na venture as I never made yet. I worked it out in my mind while I was\ntalking to her at supper. When I went upstairs to bed, our house\nbeing small and this young woman's ears sharp, I stuffed the sheet\ninto Mrs. Bucket's mouth that she shouldn't say a word of surprise\nand told her all about it. My dear, don't you give your mind to that\nagain, or I shall link your feet together at the ankles.\" Mr. Bucket,\nbreaking off, has made a noiseless descent upon mademoiselle and laid\nhis heavy hand upon her shoulder.\n\n\"What is the matter with you now?\" she asks him.\n\n\"Don't you think any more,\" returns Mr. Bucket with admonitory\nfinger, \"of throwing yourself out of window. That's what's the matter\nwith me. Come! Just take my arm. You needn't get up; I'll sit down by\nyou. Now take my arm, will you? I'm a married man, you know; you're\nacquainted with my wife. Just take my arm.\"\n\nVainly endeavouring to moisten those dry lips, with a painful sound\nshe struggles with herself and complies.\n\n\"Now we're all right again. Sir Leicester Dedlock, Baronet, this case\ncould never have been the case it is but for Mrs. Bucket, who is a\nwoman in fifty thousand--in a hundred and fifty thousand! To throw\nthis young woman off her guard, I have never set foot in our house\nsince, though I've communicated with Mrs. Bucket in the baker's\nloaves and in the milk as often as required. My whispered words to\nMrs. Bucket when she had the sheet in her mouth were, 'My dear, can\nyou throw her off continually with natural accounts of my suspicions\nagainst George, and this, and that, and t'other? Can you do without\nrest and keep watch upon her night and day? Can you undertake to say,\n'She shall do nothing without my knowledge, she shall be my prisoner\nwithout suspecting it, she shall no more escape from me than from\ndeath, and her life shall be my life, and her soul my soul, till I\nhave got her, if she did this murder?' Mrs. Bucket says to me, as\nwell as she could speak on account of the sheet, 'Bucket, I can!' And\nshe has acted up to it glorious!\"\n\n\"Lies!\" mademoiselle interposes. \"All lies, my friend!\"\n\n\"Sir Leicester Dedlock, Baronet, how did my calculations come out\nunder these circumstances? When I calculated that this impetuous\nyoung woman would overdo it in new directions, was I wrong or right?\nI was right. What does she try to do? Don't let it give you a turn?\nTo throw the murder on her ladyship.\"\n\nSir Leicester rises from his chair and staggers down again.\n\n\"And she got encouragement in it from hearing that I was always here,\nwhich was done a-purpose. Now, open that pocket-book of mine, Sir\nLeicester Dedlock, if I may take the liberty of throwing it towards\nyou, and look at the letters sent to me, each with the two words\n'Lady Dedlock' in it. Open the one directed to yourself, which I\nstopped this very morning, and read the three words 'Lady Dedlock,\nMurderess' in it. These letters have been falling about like a shower\nof lady-birds. What do you say now to Mrs. Bucket, from her spy-place\nhaving seen them all 'written by this young woman? What do you say to\nMrs. Bucket having, within this half-hour, secured the corresponding\nink and paper, fellow half-sheets and what not? What do you say to\nMrs. Bucket having watched the posting of 'em every one by this young\nwoman, Sir Leicester Dedlock, Baronet?\" Mr. Bucket asks, triumphant\nin his admiration of his lady's genius.\n\nTwo things are especially observable as Mr. Bucket proceeds to a\nconclusion. First, that he seems imperceptibly to establish a\ndreadful right of property in mademoiselle. Secondly, that the very\natmosphere she breathes seems to narrow and contract about her as if\na close net or a pall were being drawn nearer and yet nearer around\nher breathless figure.\n\n\"There is no doubt that her ladyship was on the spot at the eventful\nperiod,\" says Mr. Bucket, \"and my foreign friend here saw her, I\nbelieve, from the upper part of the staircase. Her ladyship and\nGeorge and my foreign friend were all pretty close on one another's\nheels. But that don't signify any more, so I'll not go into it. I\nfound the wadding of the pistol with which the deceased Mr.\nTulkinghorn was shot. It was a bit of the printed description of your\nhouse at Chesney Wold. Not much in that, you'll say, Sir Leicester\nDedlock, Baronet. No. But when my foreign friend here is so\nthoroughly off her guard as to think it a safe time to tear up the\nrest of that leaf, and when Mrs. Bucket puts the pieces together and\nfinds the wadding wanting, it begins to look like Queer Street.\"\n\n\"These are very long lies,\" mademoiselle interposes. \"You prose great\ndeal. Is it that you have almost all finished, or are you speaking\nalways?\"\n\n\"Sir Leicester Dedlock, Baronet,\" proceeds Mr. Bucket, who delights\nin a full title and does violence to himself when he dispenses with\nany fragment of it, \"the last point in the case which I am now going\nto mention shows the necessity of patience in our business, and never\ndoing a thing in a hurry. I watched this young woman yesterday\nwithout her knowledge when she was looking at the funeral, in company\nwith my wife, who planned to take her there; and I had so much to\nconvict her, and I saw such an expression in her face, and my mind so\nrose against her malice towards her ladyship, and the time was\naltogether such a time for bringing down what you may call\nretribution upon her, that if I had been a younger hand with less\nexperience, I should have taken her, certain. Equally, last night,\nwhen her ladyship, as is so universally admired I am sure, come home\nlooking--why, Lord, a man might almost say like Venus rising from the\nocean--it was so unpleasant and inconsistent to think of her being\ncharged with a murder of which she was innocent that I felt quite to\nwant to put an end to the job. What should I have lost? Sir Leicester\nDedlock, Baronet, I should have lost the weapon. My prisoner here\nproposed to Mrs. Bucket, after the departure of the funeral, that\nthey should go per bus a little ways into the country and take tea at\na very decent house of entertainment. Now, near that house of\nentertainment there's a piece of water. At tea, my prisoner got up to\nfetch her pocket handkercher from the bedroom where the bonnets was;\nshe was rather a long time gone and came back a little out of wind.\nAs soon as they came home this was reported to me by Mrs. Bucket,\nalong with her observations and suspicions. I had the piece of water\ndragged by moonlight, in presence of a couple of our men, and the\npocket pistol was brought up before it had been there half-a-dozen\nhours. Now, my dear, put your arm a little further through mine, and\nhold it steady, and I shan't hurt you!\"\n\nIn a trice Mr. Bucket snaps a handcuff on her wrist. \"That's one,\"\nsays Mr. Bucket. \"Now the other, darling. Two, and all told!\"\n\nHe rises; she rises too. \"Where,\" she asks him, darkening her large\neyes until their drooping lids almost conceal them--and yet they\nstare, \"where is your false, your treacherous, and cursed wife?\"\n\n\"She's gone forrard to the Police Office,\" returns Mr. Bucket.\n\"You'll see her there, my dear.\"\n\n\"I would like to kiss her!\" exclaims Mademoiselle Hortense, panting\ntigress-like.\n\n\"You'd bite her, I suspect,\" says Mr. Bucket.\n\n\"I would!\" making her eyes very large. \"I would love to tear her limb\nfrom limb.\"\n\n\"Bless you, darling,\" says Mr. Bucket with the greatest composure,\n\"I'm fully prepared to hear that. Your sex have such a surprising\nanimosity against one another when you do differ. You don't mind me\nhalf so much, do you?\"\n\n\"No. Though you are a devil still.\"\n\n\"Angel and devil by turns, eh?\" cries Mr. Bucket. \"But I am in my\nregular employment, you must consider. Let me put your shawl tidy.\nI've been lady's maid to a good many before now. Anything wanting to\nthe bonnet? There's a cab at the door.\"\n\nMademoiselle Hortense, casting an indignant eye at the glass, shakes\nherself perfectly neat in one shake and looks, to do her justice,\nuncommonly genteel.\n\n\"Listen then, my angel,\" says she after several sarcastic nods. \"You\nare very spiritual. But can you restore him back to life?\"\n\nMr. Bucket answers, \"Not exactly.\"\n\n\"That is droll. Listen yet one time. You are very spiritual. Can you\nmake a honourable lady of her?\"\n\n\"Don't be so malicious,\" says Mr. Bucket.\n\n\"Or a haughty gentleman of HIM?\" cries mademoiselle, referring to Sir\nLeicester with ineffable disdain. \"Eh! Oh, then regard him! The poor\ninfant! Ha! Ha! Ha!\"\n\n\"Come, come, why this is worse PARLAYING than the other,\" says Mr.\nBucket. \"Come along!\"\n\n\"You cannot do these things? Then you can do as you please with me.\nIt is but the death, it is all the same. Let us go, my angel. Adieu,\nyou old man, grey. I pity you, and I despise you!\"\n\nWith these last words she snaps her teeth together as if her mouth\nclosed with a spring. It is impossible to describe how Mr. Bucket\ngets her out, but he accomplishes that feat in a manner so peculiar\nto himself, enfolding and pervading her like a cloud, and hovering\naway with her as if he were a homely Jupiter and she the object of\nhis affections.\n\nSir Leicester, left alone, remains in the same attitude, as though he\nwere still listening and his attention were still occupied. At length\nhe gazes round the empty room, and finding it deserted, rises\nunsteadily to his feet, pushes back his chair, and walks a few steps,\nsupporting himself by the table. Then he stops, and with more of\nthose inarticulate sounds, lifts up his eyes and seems to stare at\nsomething.\n\nHeaven knows what he sees. The green, green woods of Chesney Wold,\nthe noble house, the pictures of his forefathers, strangers defacing\nthem, officers of police coarsely handling his most precious\nheirlooms, thousands of fingers pointing at him, thousands of faces\nsneering at him. But if such shadows flit before him to his\nbewilderment, there is one other shadow which he can name with\nsomething like distinctness even yet and to which alone he addresses\nhis tearing of his white hair and his extended arms.\n\nIt is she in association with whom, saving that she has been for\nyears a main fibre of the root of his dignity and pride, he has never\nhad a selfish thought. It is she whom he has loved, admired,\nhonoured, and set up for the world to respect. It is she who, at the\ncore of all the constrained formalities and conventionalities of his\nlife, has been a stock of living tenderness and love, susceptible as\nnothing else is of being struck with the agony he feels. He sees her,\nalmost to the exclusion of himself, and cannot bear to look upon her\ncast down from the high place she has graced so well.\n\nAnd even to the point of his sinking on the ground, oblivious of his\nsuffering, he can yet pronounce her name with something like\ndistinctness in the midst of those intrusive sounds, and in a tone of\nmourning and compassion rather than reproach.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LV\n\nFlight\n\n\nInspector Bucket of the Detective has not yet struck his great blow,\nas just now chronicled, but is yet refreshing himself with sleep\npreparatory to his field-day, when through the night and along the\nfreezing wintry roads a chaise and pair comes out of Lincolnshire,\nmaking its way towards London.\n\nRailroads shall soon traverse all this country, and with a rattle and\na glare the engine and train shall shoot like a meteor over the wide\nnight-landscape, turning the moon paler; but as yet such things are\nnon-existent in these parts, though not wholly unexpected.\nPreparations are afoot, measurements are made, ground is staked out.\nBridges are begun, and their not yet united piers desolately look at\none another over roads and streams like brick and mortar couples with\nan obstacle to their union; fragments of embankments are thrown up\nand left as precipices with torrents of rusty carts and barrows\ntumbling over them; tripods of tall poles appear on hilltops, where\nthere are rumours of tunnels; everything looks chaotic and abandoned\nin full hopelessness. Along the freezing roads, and through the\nnight, the post-chaise makes its way without a railroad on its mind.\n\nMrs. Rouncewell, so many years housekeeper at Chesney Wold, sits\nwithin the chaise; and by her side sits Mrs. Bagnet with her grey\ncloak and umbrella. The old girl would prefer the bar in front, as\nbeing exposed to the weather and a primitive sort of perch more in\naccordance with her usual course of travelling, but Mrs. Rouncewell\nis too thoughtful of her comfort to admit of her proposing it. The\nold lady cannot make enough of the old girl. She sits, in her stately\nmanner, holding her hand, and regardless of its roughness, puts it\noften to her lips. \"You are a mother, my dear soul,\" says she many\ntimes, \"and you found out my George's mother!\"\n\n\"Why, George,\" returns Mrs. Bagnet, \"was always free with me, ma'am,\nand when he said at our house to my Woolwich that of all the things\nmy Woolwich could have to think of when he grew to be a man, the\ncomfortablest would be that he had never brought a sorrowful line\ninto his mother's face or turned a hair of her head grey, then I felt\nsure, from his way, that something fresh had brought his own mother\ninto his mind. I had often known him say to me, in past times, that\nhe had behaved bad to her.\"\n\n\"Never, my dear!\" returns Mrs. Rouncewell, bursting into tears. \"My\nblessing on him, never! He was always fond of me, and loving to me,\nwas my George! But he had a bold spirit, and he ran a little wild and\nwent for a soldier. And I know he waited at first, in letting us know\nabout himself, till he should rise to be an officer; and when he\ndidn't rise, I know he considered himself beneath us, and wouldn't be\na disgrace to us. For he had a lion heart, had my George, always from\na baby!\"\n\nThe old lady's hands stray about her as of yore, while she recalls,\nall in a tremble, what a likely lad, what a fine lad, what a gay\ngood-humoured clever lad he was; how they all took to him down at\nChesney Wold; how Sir Leicester took to him when he was a young\ngentleman; how the dogs took to him; how even the people who had been\nangry with him forgave him the moment he was gone, poor boy. And now\nto see him after all, and in a prison too! And the broad stomacher\nheaves, and the quaint upright old-fashioned figure bends under its\nload of affectionate distress.\n\nMrs. Bagnet, with the instinctive skill of a good warm heart, leaves\nthe old housekeeper to her emotions for a little while--not without\npassing the back of her hand across her own motherly eyes--and\npresently chirps up in her cheery manner, \"So I says to George when I\ngoes to call him in to tea (he pretended to be smoking his pipe\noutside), 'What ails you this afternoon, George, for gracious sake? I\nhave seen all sorts, and I have seen you pretty often in season and\nout of season, abroad and at home, and I never see you so melancholy\npenitent.' 'Why, Mrs. Bagnet,' says George, 'it's because I AM\nmelancholy and penitent both, this afternoon, that you see me so.'\n'What have you done, old fellow?' I says. 'Why, Mrs. Bagnet,' says\nGeorge, shaking his head, 'what I have done has been done this many a\nlong year, and is best not tried to be undone now. If I ever get to\nheaven it won't be for being a good son to a widowed mother; I say no\nmore.' Now, ma'am, when George says to me that it's best not tried to\nbe undone now, I have my thoughts as I have often had before, and I\ndraw it out of George how he comes to have such things on him that\nafternoon. Then George tells me that he has seen by chance, at the\nlawyer's office, a fine old lady that has brought his mother plain\nbefore him, and he runs on about that old lady till he quite forgets\nhimself and paints her picture to me as she used to be, years upon\nyears back. So I says to George when he has done, who is this old\nlady he has seen? And George tells me it's Mrs. Rouncewell,\nhousekeeper for more than half a century to the Dedlock family down\nat Chesney Wold in Lincolnshire. George has frequently told me before\nthat he's a Lincolnshire man, and I says to my old Lignum that night,\n'Lignum, that's his mother for five and for-ty pound!'\"\n\nAll this Mrs. Bagnet now relates for the twentieth time at least\nwithin the last four hours. Trilling it out like a kind of bird, with\na pretty high note, that it may be audible to the old lady above the\nhum of the wheels.\n\n\"Bless you, and thank you,\" says Mrs. Rouncewell. \"Bless you, and\nthank you, my worthy soul!\"\n\n\"Dear heart!\" cries Mrs. Bagnet in the most natural manner. \"No\nthanks to me, I am sure. Thanks to yourself, ma'am, for being so\nready to pay 'em! And mind once more, ma'am, what you had best do\non finding George to be your own son is to make him--for your\nsake--have every sort of help to put himself in the right and clear\nhimself of a charge of which he is as innocent as you or me. It won't\ndo to have truth and justice on his side; he must have law and\nlawyers,\" exclaims the old girl, apparently persuaded that the latter\nform a separate establishment and have dissolved partnership with\ntruth and justice for ever and a day.\n\n\"He shall have,\" says Mrs. Rouncewell, \"all the help that can be got\nfor him in the world, my dear. I will spend all I have, and\nthankfully, to procure it. Sir Leicester will do his best, the whole\nfamily will do their best. I--I know something, my dear; and will\nmake my own appeal, as his mother parted from him all these years,\nand finding him in a jail at last.\"\n\nThe extreme disquietude of the old housekeeper's manner in saying\nthis, her broken words, and her wringing of her hands make a powerful\nimpression on Mrs. Bagnet and would astonish her but that she refers\nthem all to her sorrow for her son's condition. And yet Mrs. Bagnet\nwonders too why Mrs. Rouncewell should murmur so distractedly, \"My\nLady, my Lady, my Lady!\" over and over again.\n\nThe frosty night wears away, and the dawn breaks, and the post-chaise\ncomes rolling on through the early mist like the ghost of a chaise\ndeparted. It has plenty of spectral company in ghosts of trees and\nhedges, slowly vanishing and giving place to the realities of day.\nLondon reached, the travellers alight, the old housekeeper in great\ntribulation and confusion, Mrs. Bagnet quite fresh and collected--as\nshe would be if her next point, with no new equipage and outfit, were\nthe Cape of Good Hope, the Island of Ascension, Hong Kong, or any\nother military station.\n\nBut when they set out for the prison where the trooper is\nconfined, the old lady has managed to draw about her, with her\nlavender-coloured dress, much of the staid calmness which is its\nusual accompaniment. A wonderfully grave, precise, and handsome piece\nof old china she looks, though her heart beats fast and her stomacher\nis ruffled more than even the remembrance of this wayward son has\nruffled it these many years.\n\nApproaching the cell, they find the door opening and a warder in the\nact of coming out. The old girl promptly makes a sign of entreaty to\nhim to say nothing; assenting with a nod, he suffers them to enter as\nhe shuts the door.\n\nSo George, who is writing at his table, supposing himself to be\nalone, does not raise his eyes, but remains absorbed. The old\nhousekeeper looks at him, and those wandering hands of hers are quite\nenough for Mrs. Bagnet's confirmation, even if she could see the\nmother and the son together, knowing what she knows, and doubt their\nrelationship.\n\nNot a rustle of the housekeeper's dress, not a gesture, not a word\nbetrays her. She stands looking at him as he writes on, all\nunconscious, and only her fluttering hands give utterance to her\nemotions. But they are very eloquent, very, very eloquent. Mrs.\nBagnet understands them. They speak of gratitude, of joy, of grief,\nof hope; of inextinguishable affection, cherished with no return\nsince this stalwart man was a stripling; of a better son loved less,\nand this son loved so fondly and so proudly; and they speak in such\ntouching language that Mrs. Bagnet's eyes brim up with tears and they\nrun glistening down her sun-brown face.\n\n\"George Rouncewell! Oh, my dear child, turn and look at me!\"\n\nThe trooper starts up, clasps his mother round the neck, and falls\ndown on his knees before her. Whether in a late repentance, whether\nin the first association that comes back upon him, he puts his hands\ntogether as a child does when it says its prayers, and raising them\ntowards her breast, bows down his head, and cries.\n\n\"My George, my dearest son! Always my favourite, and my favourite\nstill, where have you been these cruel years and years? Grown such a\nman too, grown such a fine strong man. Grown so like what I knew he\nmust be, if it pleased God he was alive!\"\n\nShe can ask, and he can answer, nothing connected for a time. All\nthat time the old girl, turned away, leans one arm against the\nwhitened wall, leans her honest forehead upon it, wipes her eyes with\nher serviceable grey cloak, and quite enjoys herself like the best of\nold girls as she is.\n\n\"Mother,\" says the trooper when they are more composed, \"forgive me\nfirst of all, for I know my need of it.\"\n\nForgive him! She does it with all her heart and soul. She always has\ndone it. She tells him how she has had it written in her will, these\nmany years, that he was her beloved son George. She has never\nbelieved any ill of him, never. If she had died without this\nhappiness--and she is an old woman now and can't look to live very\nlong--she would have blessed him with her last breath, if she had had\nher senses, as her beloved son George.\n\n\"Mother, I have been an undutiful trouble to you, and I have my\nreward; but of late years I have had a kind of glimmering of a\npurpose in me too. When I left home I didn't care much, mother--I am\nafraid not a great deal--for leaving; and went away and 'listed,\nharum-scarum, making believe to think that I cared for nobody, no not\nI, and that nobody cared for me.\"\n\nThe trooper has dried his eyes and put away his handkerchief, but\nthere is an extraordinary contrast between his habitual manner of\nexpressing himself and carrying himself and the softened tone in\nwhich he speaks, interrupted occasionally by a half-stifled sob.\n\n\"So I wrote a line home, mother, as you too well know, to say I had\n'listed under another name, and I went abroad. Abroad, at one time I\nthought I would write home next year, when I might be better off; and\nwhen that year was out, I thought I would write home next year, when\nI might be better off; and when that year was out again, perhaps I\ndidn't think much about it. So on, from year to year, through a\nservice of ten years, till I began to get older, and to ask myself\nwhy should I ever write.\"\n\n\"I don't find any fault, child--but not to ease my mind, George? Not\na word to your loving mother, who was growing older too?\"\n\nThis almost overturns the trooper afresh, but he sets himself up with\na great, rough, sounding clearance of his throat.\n\n\"Heaven forgive me, mother, but I thought there would be small\nconsolation then in hearing anything about me. There were you,\nrespected and esteemed. There was my brother, as I read in chance\nNorth Country papers now and then, rising to be prosperous and\nfamous. There was I a dragoon, roving, unsettled, not self-made like\nhim, but self-unmade--all my earlier advantages thrown away, all my\nlittle learning unlearnt, nothing picked up but what unfitted me for\nmost things that I could think of. What business had I to make myself\nknown? After letting all that time go by me, what good could come of\nit? The worst was past with you, mother. I knew by that time (being a\nman) how you had mourned for me, and wept for me, and prayed for me;\nand the pain was over, or was softened down, and I was better in your\nmind as it was.\"\n\nThe old lady sorrowfully shakes her head, and taking one of his\npowerful hands, lays it lovingly upon her shoulder.\n\n\"No, I don't say that it was so, mother, but that I made it out to be\nso. I said just now, what good could come of it? Well, my dear\nmother, some good might have come of it to myself--and there was the\nmeanness of it. You would have sought me out; you would have\npurchased my discharge; you would have taken me down to Chesney Wold;\nyou would have brought me and my brother and my brother's family\ntogether; you would all have considered anxiously how to do something\nfor me and set me up as a respectable civilian. But how could any of\nyou feel sure of me when I couldn't so much as feel sure of myself?\nHow could you help regarding as an incumbrance and a discredit to you\nan idle dragooning chap who was an incumbrance and a discredit to\nhimself, excepting under discipline? How could I look my brother's\nchildren in the face and pretend to set them an example--I, the\nvagabond boy who had run away from home and been the grief and\nunhappiness of my mother's life? 'No, George.' Such were my words,\nmother, when I passed this in review before me: 'You have made your\nbed. Now, lie upon it.'\"\n\nMrs. Rouncewell, drawing up her stately form, shakes her head at the\nold girl with a swelling pride upon her, as much as to say, \"I told\nyou so!\" The old girl relieves her feelings and testifies her\ninterest in the conversation by giving the trooper a great poke\nbetween the shoulders with her umbrella; this action she afterwards\nrepeats, at intervals, in a species of affectionate lunacy, never\nfailing, after the administration of each of these remonstrances, to\nresort to the whitened wall and the grey cloak again.\n\n\"This was the way I brought myself to think, mother, that my best\namends was to lie upon that bed I had made, and die upon it. And I\nshould have done it (though I have been to see you more than once\ndown at Chesney Wold, when you little thought of me) but for my old\ncomrade's wife here, who I find has been too many for me. But I thank\nher for it. I thank you for it, Mrs. Bagnet, with all my heart and\nmight.\"\n\nTo which Mrs. Bagnet responds with two pokes.\n\nAnd now the old lady impresses upon her son George, her own dear\nrecovered boy, her joy and pride, the light of her eyes, the happy\nclose of her life, and every fond name she can think of, that he must\nbe governed by the best advice obtainable by money and influence,\nthat he must yield up his case to the greatest lawyers that can be\ngot, that he must act in this serious plight as he shall be advised\nto act and must not be self-willed, however right, but must promise\nto think only of his poor old mother's anxiety and suffering until he\nis released, or he will break her heart.\n\n\"Mother, 'tis little enough to consent to,\" returns the trooper,\nstopping her with a kiss; \"tell me what I shall do, and I'll make a\nlate beginning and do it. Mrs. Bagnet, you'll take care of my mother,\nI know?\"\n\nA very hard poke from the old girl's umbrella.\n\n\"If you'll bring her acquainted with Mr. Jarndyce and Miss Summerson,\nshe will find them of her way of thinking, and they will give her the\nbest advice and assistance.\"\n\n\"And, George,\" says the old lady, \"we must send with all haste for\nyour brother. He is a sensible sound man as they tell me--out in the\nworld beyond Chesney Wold, my dear, though I don't know much of it\nmyself--and will be of great service.\"\n\n\"Mother,\" returns the trooper, \"is it too soon to ask a favour?\"\n\n\"Surely not, my dear.\"\n\n\"Then grant me this one great favour. Don't let my brother know.\"\n\n\"Not know what, my dear?\"\n\n\"Not know of me. In fact, mother, I can't bear it; I can't make up my\nmind to it. He has proved himself so different from me and has done\nso much to raise himself while I've been soldiering that I haven't\nbrass enough in my composition to see him in this place and under\nthis charge. How could a man like him be expected to have any\npleasure in such a discovery? It's impossible. No, keep my secret\nfrom him, mother; do me a greater kindness than I deserve and keep my\nsecret from my brother, of all men.\"\n\n\"But not always, dear George?\"\n\n\"Why, mother, perhaps not for good and all--though I may come to ask\nthat too--but keep it now, I do entreat you. If it's ever broke to\nhim that his rip of a brother has turned up, I could wish,\" says the\ntrooper, shaking his head very doubtfully, \"to break it myself and be\ngoverned as to advancing or retreating by the way in which he seems\nto take it.\"\n\nAs he evidently has a rooted feeling on this point, and as the depth\nof it is recognized in Mrs. Bagnet's face, his mother yields her\nimplicit assent to what he asks. For this he thanks her kindly.\n\n\"In all other respects, my dear mother, I'll be as tractable and\nobedient as you can wish; on this one alone, I stand out. So now I am\nready even for the lawyers. I have been drawing up,\" he glances at\nhis writing on the table, \"an exact account of what I knew of the\ndeceased and how I came to be involved in this unfortunate affair.\nIt's entered, plain and regular, like an orderly-book; not a word in\nit but what's wanted for the facts. I did intend to read it, straight\non end, whensoever I was called upon to say anything in my defence. I\nhope I may be let to do it still; but I have no longer a will of my\nown in this case, and whatever is said or done, I give my promise not\nto have any.\"\n\nMatters being brought to this so far satisfactory pass, and time\nbeing on the wane, Mrs. Bagnet proposes a departure. Again and again\nthe old lady hangs upon her son's neck, and again and again the\ntrooper holds her to his broad chest.\n\n\"Where are you going to take my mother, Mrs. Bagnet?\"\n\n\"I am going to the town house, my dear, the family house. I have some\nbusiness there that must be looked to directly,\" Mrs. Rouncewell\nanswers.\n\n\"Will you see my mother safe there in a coach, Mrs. Bagnet? But of\ncourse I know you will. Why should I ask it!\"\n\nWhy indeed, Mrs. Bagnet expresses with the umbrella.\n\n\"Take her, my old friend, and take my gratitude along with you.\nKisses to Quebec and Malta, love to my godson, a hearty shake of the\nhand to Lignum, and this for yourself, and I wish it was ten thousand\npound in gold, my dear!\" So saying, the trooper puts his lips to the\nold girl's tanned forehead, and the door shuts upon him in his cell.\n\nNo entreaties on the part of the good old housekeeper will induce\nMrs. Bagnet to retain the coach for her own conveyance home. Jumping\nout cheerfully at the door of the Dedlock mansion and handing Mrs.\nRouncewell up the steps, the old girl shakes hands and trudges off,\narriving soon afterwards in the bosom of the Bagnet family and\nfalling to washing the greens as if nothing had happened.\n\nMy Lady is in that room in which she held her last conference with\nthe murdered man, and is sitting where she sat that night, and is\nlooking at the spot where he stood upon the hearth studying her so\nleisurely, when a tap comes at the door. Who is it? Mrs. Rouncewell.\nWhat has brought Mrs. Rouncewell to town so unexpectedly?\n\n\"Trouble, my Lady. Sad trouble. Oh, my Lady, may I beg a word with\nyou?\"\n\nWhat new occurrence is it that makes this tranquil old woman tremble\nso? Far happier than her Lady, as her Lady has often thought, why\ndoes she falter in this manner and look at her with such strange\nmistrust?\n\n\"What is the matter? Sit down and take your breath.\"\n\n\"Oh, my Lady, my Lady. I have found my son--my youngest, who went\naway for a soldier so long ago. And he is in prison.\"\n\n\"For debt?\"\n\n\"Oh, no, my Lady; I would have paid any debt, and joyful.\"\n\n\"For what is he in prison then?\"\n\n\"Charged with a murder, my Lady, of which he is as innocent as--as I\nam. Accused of the murder of Mr. Tulkinghorn.\"\n\nWhat does she mean by this look and this imploring gesture? Why does\nshe come so close? What is the letter that she holds?\n\n\"Lady Dedlock, my dear Lady, my good Lady, my kind Lady! You must\nhave a heart to feel for me, you must have a heart to forgive me. I\nwas in this family before you were born. I am devoted to it. But\nthink of my dear son wrongfully accused.\"\n\n\"I do not accuse him.\"\n\n\"No, my Lady, no. But others do, and he is in prison and in danger.\nOh, Lady Dedlock, if you can say but a word to help to clear him, say\nit!\"\n\nWhat delusion can this be? What power does she suppose is in the\nperson she petitions to avert this unjust suspicion, if it be unjust?\nHer Lady's handsome eyes regard her with astonishment, almost with\nfear.\n\n\"My Lady, I came away last night from Chesney Wold to find my son in\nmy old age, and the step upon the Ghost's Walk was so constant and so\nsolemn that I never heard the like in all these years. Night after\nnight, as it has fallen dark, the sound has echoed through your\nrooms, but last night it was awfullest. And as it fell dark last\nnight, my Lady, I got this letter.\"\n\n\"What letter is it?\"\n\n\"Hush! Hush!\" The housekeeper looks round and answers in a frightened\nwhisper, \"My Lady, I have not breathed a word of it, I don't believe\nwhat's written in it, I know it can't be true, I am sure and certain\nthat it is not true. But my son is in danger, and you must have a\nheart to pity me. If you know of anything that is not known to\nothers, if you have any suspicion, if you have any clue at all, and\nany reason for keeping it in your own breast, oh, my dear Lady, think\nof me, and conquer that reason, and let it be known! This is the most\nI consider possible. I know you are not a hard lady, but you go your\nown way always without help, and you are not familiar with your\nfriends; and all who admire you--and all do--as a beautiful and\nelegant lady, know you to be one far away from themselves who can't\nbe approached close. My Lady, you may have some proud or angry\nreasons for disdaining to utter something that you know; if so, pray,\noh, pray, think of a faithful servant whose whole life has been\npassed in this family which she dearly loves, and relent, and help to\nclear my son! My Lady, my good Lady,\" the old housekeeper pleads with\ngenuine simplicity, \"I am so humble in my place and you are by nature\nso high and distant that you may not think what I feel for my child,\nbut I feel so much that I have come here to make so bold as to beg\nand pray you not to be scornful of us if you can do us any right or\njustice at this fearful time!\"\n\nLady Dedlock raises her without one word, until she takes the letter\nfrom her hand.\n\n\"Am I to read this?\"\n\n\"When I am gone, my Lady, if you please, and then remembering the\nmost that I consider possible.\"\n\n\"I know of nothing I can do. I know of nothing I reserve that can\naffect your son. I have never accused him.\"\n\n\"My Lady, you may pity him the more under a false accusation after\nreading the letter.\"\n\nThe old housekeeper leaves her with the letter in her hand. In truth\nshe is not a hard lady naturally, and the time has been when the\nsight of the venerable figure suing to her with such strong\nearnestness would have moved her to great compassion. But so long\naccustomed to suppress emotion and keep down reality, so long\nschooled for her own purposes in that destructive school which shuts\nup the natural feelings of the heart like flies in amber and spreads\none uniform and dreary gloss over the good and bad, the feeling and\nthe unfeeling, the sensible and the senseless, she had subdued even\nher wonder until now.\n\nShe opens the letter. Spread out upon the paper is a printed account\nof the discovery of the body as it lay face downward on the floor,\nshot through the heart; and underneath is written her own name, with\nthe word \"murderess\" attached.\n\nIt falls out of her hand. How long it may have lain upon the ground\nshe knows not, but it lies where it fell when a servant stands before\nher announcing the young man of the name of Guppy. The words have\nprobably been repeated several times, for they are ringing in her\nhead before she begins to understand them.\n\n\"Let him come in!\"\n\nHe comes in. Holding the letter in her hand, which she has taken from\nthe floor, she tries to collect her thoughts. In the eyes of Mr.\nGuppy she is the same Lady Dedlock, holding the same prepared, proud,\nchilling state.\n\n\"Your ladyship may not be at first disposed to excuse this visit from\none who has never been welcome to your ladyship\"--which he don't\ncomplain of, for he is bound to confess that there never has been any\nparticular reason on the face of things why he should be--\"but I hope\nwhen I mention my motives to your ladyship you will not find fault\nwith me,\" says Mr. Guppy.\n\n\"Do so.\"\n\n\"Thank your ladyship. I ought first to explain to your ladyship,\" Mr.\nGuppy sits on the edge of a chair and puts his hat on the carpet at\nhis feet, \"that Miss Summerson, whose image, as I formerly mentioned\nto your ladyship, was at one period of my life imprinted on my 'eart\nuntil erased by circumstances over which I had no control,\ncommunicated to me, after I had the pleasure of waiting on your\nladyship last, that she particularly wished me to take no steps\nwhatever in any manner at all relating to her. And Miss Summerson's\nwishes being to me a law (except as connected with circumstances over\nwhich I have no control), I consequently never expected to have the\ndistinguished honour of waiting on your ladyship again.\"\n\nAnd yet he is here now, Lady Dedlock moodily reminds him.\n\n\"And yet I am here now,\" Mr. Guppy admits. \"My object being to\ncommunicate to your ladyship, under the seal of confidence, why I am\nhere.\"\n\nHe cannot do so, she tells him, too plainly or too briefly. \"Nor can\nI,\" Mr. Guppy returns with a sense of injury upon him, \"too\nparticularly request your ladyship to take particular notice that\nit's no personal affair of mine that brings me here. I have no\ninterested views of my own to serve in coming here. If it was not for\nmy promise to Miss Summerson and my keeping of it sacred--I, in point\nof fact, shouldn't have darkened these doors again, but should have\nseen 'em further first.\"\n\nMr. Guppy considers this a favourable moment for sticking up his hair\nwith both hands.\n\n\"Your ladyship will remember when I mention it that the last time I\nwas here I run against a party very eminent in our profession and\nwhose loss we all deplore. That party certainly did from that time\napply himself to cutting in against me in a way that I will call\nsharp practice, and did make it, at every turn and point, extremely\ndifficult for me to be sure that I hadn't inadvertently led up to\nsomething contrary to Miss Summerson's wishes. Self-praise is no\nrecommendation, but I may say for myself that I am not so bad a man\nof business neither.\"\n\nLady Dedlock looks at him in stern inquiry. Mr. Guppy immediately\nwithdraws his eyes from her face and looks anywhere else.\n\n\"Indeed, it has been made so hard,\" he goes on, \"to have any idea\nwhat that party was up to in combination with others that until the\nloss which we all deplore I was gravelled--an expression which your\nladyship, moving in the higher circles, will be so good as to\nconsider tantamount to knocked over. Small likewise--a name by which\nI refer to another party, a friend of mine that your ladyship is not\nacquainted with--got to be so close and double-faced that at times it\nwasn't easy to keep one's hands off his 'ead. However, what with the\nexertion of my humble abilities, and what with the help of a mutual\nfriend by the name of Mr. Tony Weevle (who is of a high aristocratic\nturn and has your ladyship's portrait always hanging up in his room),\nI have now reasons for an apprehension as to which I come to put your\nladyship upon your guard. First, will your ladyship allow me to ask\nyou whether you have had any strange visitors this morning? I don't\nmean fashionable visitors, but such visitors, for instance, as Miss\nBarbary's old servant, or as a person without the use of his lower\nextremities, carried upstairs similarly to a guy?\"\n\n\"No!\"\n\n\"Then I assure your ladyship that such visitors have been here and\nhave been received here. Because I saw them at the door, and waited\nat the corner of the square till they came out, and took half an\nhour's turn afterwards to avoid them.\"\n\n\"What have I to do with that, or what have you? I do not understand\nyou. What do you mean?\"\n\n\"Your ladyship, I come to put you on your guard. There may be no\noccasion for it. Very well. Then I have only done my best to keep my\npromise to Miss Summerson. I strongly suspect (from what Small has\ndropped, and from what we have corkscrewed out of him) that those\nletters I was to have brought to your ladyship were not destroyed\nwhen I supposed they were. That if there was anything to be blown\nupon, it IS blown upon. That the visitors I have alluded to have been\nhere this morning to make money of it. And that the money is made, or\nmaking.\"\n\nMr. Guppy picks up his hat and rises.\n\n\"Your ladyship, you know best whether there's anything in what I say\nor whether there's nothing. Something or nothing, I have acted up to\nMiss Summerson's wishes in letting things alone and in undoing what I\nhad begun to do, as far as possible; that's sufficient for me. In\ncase I should be taking a liberty in putting your ladyship on your\nguard when there's no necessity for it, you will endeavour, I should\nhope, to outlive my presumption, and I shall endeavour to outlive\nyour disapprobation. I now take my farewell of your ladyship, and\nassure you that there's no danger of your ever being waited on by me\nagain.\"\n\nShe scarcely acknowledges these parting words by any look, but when\nhe has been gone a little while, she rings her bell.\n\n\"Where is Sir Leicester?\"\n\nMercury reports that he is at present shut up in the library alone.\n\n\"Has Sir Leicester had any visitors this morning?\"\n\nSeveral, on business. Mercury proceeds to a description of them,\nwhich has been anticipated by Mr. Guppy. Enough; he may go.\n\nSo! All is broken down. Her name is in these many mouths, her husband\nknows his wrongs, her shame will be published--may be spreading while\nshe thinks about it--and in addition to the thunderbolt so long\nforeseen by her, so unforeseen by him, she is denounced by an\ninvisible accuser as the murderess of her enemy.\n\nHer enemy he was, and she has often, often, often wished him dead.\nHer enemy he is, even in his grave. This dreadful accusation comes\nupon her like a new torment at his lifeless hand. And when she\nrecalls how she was secretly at his door that night, and how she may\nbe represented to have sent her favourite girl away so soon before\nmerely to release herself from observation, she shudders as if the\nhangman's hands were at her neck.\n\nShe has thrown herself upon the floor and lies with her hair all\nwildly scattered and her face buried in the cushions of a couch. She\nrises up, hurries to and fro, flings herself down again, and rocks\nand moans. The horror that is upon her is unutterable. If she really\nwere the murderess, it could hardly be, for the moment, more intense.\n\nFor as her murderous perspective, before the doing of the deed,\nhowever subtle the precautions for its commission, would have been\nclosed up by a gigantic dilatation of the hateful figure, preventing\nher from seeing any consequences beyond it; and as those consequences\nwould have rushed in, in an unimagined flood, the moment the figure\nwas laid low--which always happens when a murder is done; so, now she\nsees that when he used to be on the watch before her, and she used to\nthink, \"if some mortal stroke would but fall on this old man and take\nhim from my way!\" it was but wishing that all he held against her in\nhis hand might be flung to the winds and chance-sown in many places.\nSo, too, with the wicked relief she has felt in his death. What was\nhis death but the key-stone of a gloomy arch removed, and now the\narch begins to fall in a thousand fragments, each crushing and\nmangling piecemeal!\n\nThus, a terrible impression steals upon and overshadows her that from\nthis pursuer, living or dead--obdurate and imperturbable before her\nin his well-remembered shape, or not more obdurate and imperturbable\nin his coffin-bed--there is no escape but in death. Hunted, she\nflies. The complication of her shame, her dread, remorse, and misery,\noverwhelms her at its height; and even her strength of self-reliance\nis overturned and whirled away like a leaf before a mighty wind.\n\nShe hurriedly addresses these lines to her husband, seals, and leaves\nthem on her table:\n\n\n   If I am sought for, or accused of, his murder, believe\n   that I am wholly innocent. Believe no other good of me,\n   for I am innocent of nothing else that you have heard,\n   or will hear, laid to my charge. He prepared me, on that\n   fatal night, for his disclosure of my guilt to you. After\n   he had left me, I went out on pretence of walking in the\n   garden where I sometimes walk, but really to follow him\n   and make one last petition that he would not protract the\n   dreadful suspense on which I have been racked by him, you\n   do not know how long, but would mercifully strike next\n   morning.\n\n   I found his house dark and silent. I rang twice at his\n   door, but there was no reply, and I came home.\n\n   I have no home left. I will encumber you no more. May\n   you, in your just resentment, be able to forget the\n   unworthy woman on whom you have wasted a most generous\n   devotion--who avoids you only with a deeper shame than\n   that with which she hurries from herself--and who writes\n   this last adieu.\n\n\nShe veils and dresses quickly, leaves all her jewels and her money,\nlistens, goes downstairs at a moment when the hall is empty, opens\nand shuts the great door, flutters away in the shrill frosty wind.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LVI\n\nPursuit\n\n\nImpassive, as behoves its high breeding, the Dedlock town house\nstares at the other houses in the street of dismal grandeur and gives\nno outward sign of anything going wrong within. Carriages rattle,\ndoors are battered at, the world exchanges calls; ancient charmers\nwith skeleton throats and peachy cheeks that have a rather ghastly\nbloom upon them seen by daylight, when indeed these fascinating\ncreatures look like Death and the Lady fused together, dazzle the\neyes of men. Forth from the frigid mews come easily swinging\ncarriages guided by short-legged coachmen in flaxen wigs, deep sunk\ninto downy hammercloths, and up behind mount luscious Mercuries\nbearing sticks of state and wearing cocked hats broadwise, a\nspectacle for the angels.\n\nThe Dedlock town house changes not externally, and hours pass before\nits exalted dullness is disturbed within. But Volumnia the fair,\nbeing subject to the prevalent complaint of boredom and finding that\ndisorder attacking her spirits with some virulence, ventures at\nlength to repair to the library for change of scene. Her gentle\ntapping at the door producing no response, she opens it and peeps in;\nseeing no one there, takes possession.\n\nThe sprightly Dedlock is reputed, in that grass-grown city of the\nancients, Bath, to be stimulated by an urgent curiosity which impels\nher on all convenient and inconvenient occasions to sidle about with\na golden glass at her eye, peering into objects of every description.\nCertain it is that she avails herself of the present opportunity of\nhovering over her kinsman's letters and papers like a bird, taking a\nshort peck at this document and a blink with her head on one side at\nthat document, and hopping about from table to table with her glass\nat her eye in an inquisitive and restless manner. In the course of\nthese researches she stumbles over something, and turning her glass\nin that direction, sees her kinsman lying on the ground like a felled\ntree.\n\nVolumnia's pet little scream acquires a considerable augmentation of\nreality from this surprise, and the house is quickly in commotion.\nServants tear up and down stairs, bells are violently rung, doctors\nare sent for, and Lady Dedlock is sought in all directions, but not\nfound. Nobody has seen or heard her since she last rang her bell. Her\nletter to Sir Leicester is discovered on her table, but it is\ndoubtful yet whether he has not received another missive from another\nworld requiring to be personally answered, and all the living\nlanguages, and all the dead, are as one to him.\n\nThey lay him down upon his bed, and chafe, and rub, and fan, and put\nice to his head, and try every means of restoration. Howbeit, the day\nhas ebbed away, and it is night in his room before his stertorous\nbreathing lulls or his fixed eyes show any consciousness of the\ncandle that is occasionally passed before them. But when this change\nbegins, it goes on; and by and by he nods or moves his eyes or even\nhis hand in token that he hears and comprehends.\n\nHe fell down, this morning, a handsome stately gentleman, somewhat\ninfirm, but of a fine presence, and with a well-filled face. He lies\nupon his bed, an aged man with sunken cheeks, the decrepit shadow of\nhimself. His voice was rich and mellow and he had so long been\nthoroughly persuaded of the weight and import to mankind of any word\nhe said that his words really had come to sound as if there were\nsomething in them. But now he can only whisper, and what he whispers\nsounds like what it is--mere jumble and jargon.\n\nHis favourite and faithful housekeeper stands at his bedside. It is\nthe first act he notices, and he clearly derives pleasure from it.\nAfter vainly trying to make himself understood in speech, he makes\nsigns for a pencil. So inexpressively that they cannot at first\nunderstand him; it is his old housekeeper who makes out what he wants\nand brings in a slate.\n\nAfter pausing for some time, he slowly scrawls upon it in a hand that\nis not his, \"Chesney Wold?\"\n\nNo, she tells him; he is in London. He was taken ill in the library\nthis morning. Right thankful she is that she happened to come to\nLondon and is able to attend upon him.\n\n\"It is not an illness of any serious consequence, Sir Leicester. You\nwill be much better to-morrow, Sir Leicester. All the gentlemen say\nso.\" This, with the tears coursing down her fair old face.\n\nAfter making a survey of the room and looking with particular\nattention all round the bed where the doctors stand, he writes, \"My\nLady.\"\n\n\"My Lady went out, Sir Leicester, before you were taken ill, and\ndon't know of your illness yet.\"\n\nHe points again, in great agitation, at the two words. They all try\nto quiet him, but he points again with increased agitation. On their\nlooking at one another, not knowing what to say, he takes the slate\nonce more and writes \"My Lady. For God's sake, where?\" And makes an\nimploring moan.\n\nIt is thought better that his old housekeeper should give him Lady\nDedlock's letter, the contents of which no one knows or can surmise.\nShe opens it for him and puts it out for his perusal. Having read it\ntwice by a great effort, he turns it down so that it shall not be\nseen and lies moaning. He passes into a kind of relapse or into a\nswoon, and it is an hour before he opens his eyes, reclining on his\nfaithful and attached old servant's arm. The doctors know that he is\nbest with her, and when not actively engaged about him, stand aloof.\n\nThe slate comes into requisition again, but the word he wants to\nwrite he cannot remember. His anxiety, his eagerness, and affliction\nat this pass are pitiable to behold. It seems as if he must go mad in\nthe necessity he feels for haste and the inability under which he\nlabours of expressing to do what or to fetch whom. He has written the\nletter B, and there stopped. Of a sudden, in the height of his\nmisery, he puts Mr. before it. The old housekeeper suggests Bucket.\nThank heaven! That's his meaning.\n\nMr. Bucket is found to be downstairs, by appointment. Shall he come\nup?\n\nThere is no possibility of misconstruing Sir Leicester's burning wish\nto see him or the desire he signifies to have the room cleared of\nevery one but the housekeeper. It is speedily done, and Mr. Bucket\nappears. Of all men upon earth, Sir Leicester seems fallen from his\nhigh estate to place his sole trust and reliance upon this man.\n\n\"Sir Leicester Dedlock, Baronet, I'm sorry to see you like this. I\nhope you'll cheer up. I'm sure you will, on account of the family\ncredit.\"\n\nSir Leicester puts her letter in his hands and looks intently in his\nface while he reads it. A new intelligence comes into Mr. Bucket's\neye as he reads on; with one hook of his finger, while that eye is\nstill glancing over the words, he indicates, \"Sir Leicester Dedlock,\nBaronet, I understand you.\"\n\nSir Leicester writes upon the slate. \"Full forgiveness. Find--\" Mr.\nBucket stops his hand.\n\n\"Sir Leicester Dedlock, Baronet, I'll find her. But my search after\nher must be begun out of hand. Not a minute must be lost.\"\n\nWith the quickness of thought, he follows Sir Leicester Dedlock's\nlook towards a little box upon a table.\n\n\"Bring it here, Sir Leicester Dedlock, Baronet? Certainly. Open it\nwith one of these here keys? Certainly. The littlest key? TO be sure.\nTake the notes out? So I will. Count 'em? That's soon done. Twenty\nand thirty's fifty, and twenty's seventy, and fifty's one twenty, and\nforty's one sixty. Take 'em for expenses? That I'll do, and render an\naccount of course. Don't spare money? No I won't.\"\n\nThe velocity and certainty of Mr. Bucket's interpretation on all\nthese heads is little short of miraculous. Mrs. Rouncewell, who holds\nthe light, is giddy with the swiftness of his eyes and hands as he\nstarts up, furnished for his journey.\n\n\"You're George's mother, old lady; that's about what you are, I\nbelieve?\" says Mr. Bucket aside, with his hat already on and\nbuttoning his coat.\n\n\"Yes, sir, I am his distressed mother.\"\n\n\"So I thought, according to what he mentioned to me just now. Well,\nthen, I'll tell you something. You needn't be distressed no more.\nYour son's all right. Now, don't you begin a-crying, because what\nyou've got to do is to take care of Sir Leicester Dedlock, Baronet,\nand you won't do that by crying. As to your son, he's all right, I\ntell you; and he sends his loving duty, and hoping you're the same.\nHe's discharged honourable; that's about what HE is; with no more\nimputation on his character than there is on yours, and yours is a\ntidy one, I'LL bet a pound. You may trust me, for I took your son. He\nconducted himself in a game way, too, on that occasion; and he's a\nfine-made man, and you're a fine-made old lady, and you're a mother\nand son, the pair of you, as might be showed for models in a caravan.\nSir Leicester Dedlock, Baronet, what you've trusted to me I'll go\nthrough with. Don't you be afraid of my turning out of my way, right\nor left, or taking a sleep, or a wash, or a shave till I have found\nwhat I go in search of. Say everything as is kind and forgiving on\nyour part? Sir Leicester Dedlock, Baronet, I will. And I wish you\nbetter, and these family affairs smoothed over--as, Lord, many other\nfamily affairs equally has been, and equally will be, to the end of\ntime.\"\n\nWith this peroration, Mr. Bucket, buttoned up, goes quietly out,\nlooking steadily before him as if he were already piercing the night\nin quest of the fugitive.\n\nHis first step is to take himself to Lady Dedlock's rooms and look\nall over them for any trifling indication that may help him. The\nrooms are in darkness now; and to see Mr. Bucket with a wax-light in\nhis hand, holding it above his head and taking a sharp mental\ninventory of the many delicate objects so curiously at variance with\nhimself, would be to see a sight--which nobody DOES see, as he is\nparticular to lock himself in.\n\n\"A spicy boudoir, this,\" says Mr. Bucket, who feels in a manner\nfurbished up in his French by the blow of the morning. \"Must have\ncost a sight of money. Rum articles to cut away from, these; she must\nhave been hard put to it!\"\n\nOpening and shutting table-drawers and looking into caskets and\njewel-cases, he sees the reflection of himself in various mirrors,\nand moralizes thereon.\n\n\"One might suppose I was a-moving in the fashionable circles and\ngetting myself up for almac's,\" says Mr. Bucket. \"I begin to think I\nmust be a swell in the Guards without knowing it.\"\n\nEver looking about, he has opened a dainty little chest in an inner\ndrawer. His great hand, turning over some gloves which it can\nscarcely feel, they are so light and soft within it, comes upon a\nwhite handkerchief.\n\n\"Hum! Let's have a look at YOU,\" says Mr. Bucket, putting down the\nlight. \"What should YOU be kept by yourself for? What's YOUR motive?\nAre you her ladyship's property, or somebody else's? You've got a\nmark upon you somewheres or another, I suppose?\"\n\nHe finds it as he speaks, \"Esther Summerson.\"\n\n\"Oh!\" says Mr. Bucket, pausing, with his finger at his ear. \"Come,\nI'll take YOU.\"\n\nHe completes his observations as quietly and carefully as he has\ncarried them on, leaves everything else precisely as he found it,\nglides away after some five minutes in all, and passes into the\nstreet. With a glance upward at the dimly lighted windows of Sir\nLeicester's room, he sets off, full-swing, to the nearest\ncoach-stand, picks out the horse for his money, and directs to be\ndriven to the shooting gallery. Mr. Bucket does not claim to be a\nscientific judge of horses, but he lays out a little money on the\nprincipal events in that line, and generally sums up his knowledge of\nthe subject in the remark that when he sees a horse as can go, he\nknows him.\n\nHis knowledge is not at fault in the present instance. Clattering\nover the stones at a dangerous pace, yet thoughtfully bringing his\nkeen eyes to bear on every slinking creature whom he passes in the\nmidnight streets, and even on the lights in upper windows where\npeople are going or gone to bed, and on all the turnings that he\nrattles by, and alike on the heavy sky, and on the earth where the\nsnow lies thin--for something may present itself to assist him,\nanywhere--he dashes to his destination at such a speed that when he\nstops the horse half smothers him in a cloud of steam.\n\n\"Unbear him half a moment to freshen him up, and I'll be back.\"\n\nHe runs up the long wooden entry and finds the trooper smoking his\npipe.\n\n\"I thought I should, George, after what you have gone through, my\nlad. I haven't a word to spare. Now, honour! All to save a woman.\nMiss Summerson that was here when Gridley died--that was the name, I\nknow--all right--where does she live?\"\n\nThe trooper has just come from there and gives him the address, near\nOxford Street.\n\n\"You won't repent it, George. Good night!\"\n\nHe is off again, with an impression of having seen Phil sitting by\nthe frosty fire staring at him open-mouthed, and gallops away again,\nand gets out in a cloud of steam again.\n\nMr. Jarndyce, the only person up in the house, is just going to bed,\nrises from his book on hearing the rapid ringing at the bell, and\ncomes down to the door in his dressing-gown.\n\n\"Don't be alarmed, sir.\" In a moment his visitor is confidential with\nhim in the hall, has shut the door, and stands with his hand upon the\nlock. \"I've had the pleasure of seeing you before. Inspector Bucket.\nLook at that handkerchief, sir, Miss Esther Summerson's. Found it\nmyself put away in a drawer of Lady Dedlock's, quarter of an hour\nago. Not a moment to lose. Matter of life or death. You know Lady\nDedlock?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"There has been a discovery there to-day. Family affairs have come\nout. Sir Leicester Dedlock, Baronet, has had a fit--apoplexy or\nparalysis--and couldn't be brought to, and precious time has been\nlost. Lady Dedlock disappeared this afternoon and left a letter for\nhim that looks bad. Run your eye over it. Here it is!\"\n\nMr. Jarndyce, having read it, asks him what he thinks.\n\n\"I don't know. It looks like suicide. Anyways, there's more and more\ndanger, every minute, of its drawing to that. I'd give a hundred\npound an hour to have got the start of the present time. Now, Mr.\nJarndyce, I am employed by Sir Leicester Dedlock, Baronet, to follow\nher and find her, to save her and take her his forgiveness. I have\nmoney and full power, but I want something else. I want Miss\nSummerson.\"\n\nMr. Jarndyce in a troubled voice repeats, \"Miss Summerson?\"\n\n\"Now, Mr. Jarndyce\"--Mr. Bucket has read his face with the greatest\nattention all along--\"I speak to you as a gentleman of a humane\nheart, and under such pressing circumstances as don't often happen.\nIf ever delay was dangerous, it's dangerous now; and if ever you\ncouldn't afterwards forgive yourself for causing it, this is the\ntime. Eight or ten hours, worth, as I tell you, a hundred pound\napiece at least, have been lost since Lady Dedlock disappeared. I am\ncharged to find her. I am Inspector Bucket. Besides all the rest\nthat's heavy on her, she has upon her, as she believes, suspicion of\nmurder. If I follow her alone, she, being in ignorance of what Sir\nLeicester Dedlock, Baronet, has communicated to me, may be driven to\ndesperation. But if I follow her in company with a young lady,\nanswering to the description of a young lady that she has a\ntenderness for--I ask no question, and I say no more than that--she\nwill give me credit for being friendly. Let me come up with her and\nbe able to have the hold upon her of putting that young lady for'ard,\nand I'll save her and prevail with her if she is alive. Let me come\nup with her alone--a hard matter--and I'll do my best, but I don't\nanswer for what the best may be. Time flies; it's getting on for one\no'clock. When one strikes, there's another hour gone, and it's worth\na thousand pound now instead of a hundred.\"\n\nThis is all true, and the pressing nature of the case cannot be\nquestioned. Mr. Jarndyce begs him to remain there while he speaks to\nMiss Summerson. Mr. Bucket says he will, but acting on his usual\nprinciple, does no such thing, following upstairs instead and keeping\nhis man in sight. So he remains, dodging and lurking about in the\ngloom of the staircase while they confer. In a very little time Mr.\nJarndyce comes down and tells him that Miss Summerson will join him\ndirectly and place herself under his protection to accompany him\nwhere he pleases. Mr. Bucket, satisfied, expresses high approval and\nawaits her coming at the door.\n\nThere he mounts a high tower in his mind and looks out far and wide.\nMany solitary figures he perceives creeping through the streets; many\nsolitary figures out on heaths, and roads, and lying under haystacks.\nBut the figure that he seeks is not among them. Other solitaries he\nperceives, in nooks of bridges, looking over; and in shadowed places\ndown by the river's level; and a dark, dark, shapeless object\ndrifting with the tide, more solitary than all, clings with a\ndrowning hold on his attention.\n\nWhere is she? Living or dead, where is she? If, as he folds the\nhandkerchief and carefully puts it up, it were able with an enchanted\npower to bring before him the place where she found it and the\nnight-landscape near the cottage where it covered the little child,\nwould he descry her there? On the waste where the brick-kilns are\nburning with a pale blue flare, where the straw-roofs of the wretched\nhuts in which the bricks are made are being scattered by the wind,\nwhere the clay and water are hard frozen and the mill in which the\ngaunt blind horse goes round all day looks like an instrument of\nhuman torture--traversing this deserted, blighted spot there is a\nlonely figure with the sad world to itself, pelted by the snow and\ndriven by the wind, and cast out, it would seem, from all\ncompanionship. It is the figure of a woman, too; but it is miserably\ndressed, and no such clothes ever came through the hall and out at\nthe great door of the Dedlock mansion.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LVII\n\nEsther's Narrative\n\n\nI had gone to bed and fallen asleep when my guardian knocked at the\ndoor of my room and begged me to get up directly. On my hurrying to\nspeak to him and learn what had happened, he told me, after a word or\ntwo of preparation, that there had been a discovery at Sir Leicester\nDedlock's. That my mother had fled, that a person was now at our door\nwho was empowered to convey to her the fullest assurances of\naffectionate protection and forgiveness if he could possibly find\nher, and that I was sought for to accompany him in the hope that my\nentreaties might prevail upon her if his failed. Something to this\ngeneral purpose I made out, but I was thrown into such a tumult of\nalarm, and hurry and distress, that in spite of every effort I could\nmake to subdue my agitation, I did not seem, to myself, fully to\nrecover my right mind until hours had passed.\n\nBut I dressed and wrapped up expeditiously without waking Charley or\nany one and went down to Mr. Bucket, who was the person entrusted\nwith the secret. In taking me to him my guardian told me this, and\nalso explained how it was that he had come to think of me. Mr.\nBucket, in a low voice, by the light of my guardian's candle, read to\nme in the hall a letter that my mother had left upon her table; and I\nsuppose within ten minutes of my having been aroused I was sitting\nbeside him, rolling swiftly through the streets.\n\nHis manner was very keen, and yet considerate when he explained to me\nthat a great deal might depend on my being able to answer, without\nconfusion, a few questions that he wished to ask me. These were,\nchiefly, whether I had had much communication with my mother (to whom\nhe only referred as Lady Dedlock), when and where I had spoken with\nher last, and how she had become possessed of my handkerchief. When I\nhad satisfied him on these points, he asked me particularly to\nconsider--taking time to think--whether within my knowledge there was\nany one, no matter where, in whom she might be at all likely to\nconfide under circumstances of the last necessity. I could think of\nno one but my guardian. But by and by I mentioned Mr. Boythorn. He\ncame into my mind as connected with his old chivalrous manner of\nmentioning my mother's name and with what my guardian had informed me\nof his engagement to her sister and his unconscious connexion with\nher unhappy story.\n\nMy companion had stopped the driver while we held this conversation,\nthat we might the better hear each other. He now told him to go on\nagain and said to me, after considering within himself for a few\nmoments, that he had made up his mind how to proceed. He was quite\nwilling to tell me what his plan was, but I did not feel clear enough\nto understand it.\n\nWe had not driven very far from our lodgings when we stopped in a\nby-street at a public-looking place lighted up with gas. Mr. Bucket\ntook me in and sat me in an arm-chair by a bright fire. It was now\npast one, as I saw by the clock against the wall. Two police\nofficers, looking in their perfectly neat uniform not at all like\npeople who were up all night, were quietly writing at a desk; and the\nplace seemed very quiet altogether, except for some beating and\ncalling out at distant doors underground, to which nobody paid any\nattention.\n\nA third man in uniform, whom Mr. Bucket called and to whom he\nwhispered his instructions, went out; and then the two others advised\ntogether while one wrote from Mr. Bucket's subdued dictation. It was\na description of my mother that they were busy with, for Mr. Bucket\nbrought it to me when it was done and read it in a whisper. It was\nvery accurate indeed.\n\nThe second officer, who had attended to it closely, then copied it\nout and called in another man in uniform (there were several in an\nouter room), who took it up and went away with it. All this was done\nwith the greatest dispatch and without the waste of a moment; yet\nnobody was at all hurried. As soon as the paper was sent out upon its\ntravels, the two officers resumed their former quiet work of writing\nwith neatness and care. Mr. Bucket thoughtfully came and warmed the\nsoles of his boots, first one and then the other, at the fire.\n\n\"Are you well wrapped up, Miss Summerson?\" he asked me as his eyes\nmet mine. \"It's a desperate sharp night for a young lady to be out\nin.\"\n\nI told him I cared for no weather and was warmly clothed.\n\n\"It may be a long job,\" he observed; \"but so that it ends well, never\nmind, miss.\"\n\n\"I pray to heaven it may end well!\" said I.\n\nHe nodded comfortingly. \"You see, whatever you do, don't you go and\nfret yourself. You keep yourself cool and equal for anything that may\nhappen, and it'll be the better for you, the better for me, the\nbetter for Lady Dedlock, and the better for Sir Leicester Dedlock,\nBaronet.\"\n\nHe was really very kind and gentle, and as he stood before the fire\nwarming his boots and rubbing his face with his forefinger, I felt a\nconfidence in his sagacity which reassured me. It was not yet a\nquarter to two when I heard horses' feet and wheels outside. \"Now,\nMiss Summerson,\" said he, \"we are off, if you please!\"\n\nHe gave me his arm, and the two officers courteously bowed me out,\nand we found at the door a phaeton or barouche with a postilion and\npost horses. Mr. Bucket handed me in and took his own seat on the\nbox. The man in uniform whom he had sent to fetch this equipage then\nhanded him up a dark lantern at his request, and when he had given a\nfew directions to the driver, we rattled away.\n\nI was far from sure that I was not in a dream. We rattled with great\nrapidity through such a labyrinth of streets that I soon lost all\nidea where we were, except that we had crossed and re-crossed the\nriver, and still seemed to be traversing a low-lying, waterside,\ndense neighbourhood of narrow thoroughfares chequered by docks and\nbasins, high piles of warehouses, swing-bridges, and masts of ships.\nAt length we stopped at the corner of a little slimy turning, which\nthe wind from the river, rushing up it, did not purify; and I saw my\ncompanion, by the light of his lantern, in conference with several\nmen who looked like a mixture of police and sailors. Against the\nmouldering wall by which they stood, there was a bill, on which I\ncould discern the words, \"Found Drowned\"; and this and an inscription\nabout drags possessed me with the awful suspicion shadowed forth in\nour visit to that place.\n\nI had no need to remind myself that I was not there by the indulgence\nof any feeling of mine to increase the difficulties of the search, or\nto lessen its hopes, or enhance its delays. I remained quiet, but\nwhat I suffered in that dreadful spot I never can forget. And still\nit was like the horror of a dream. A man yet dark and muddy, in long\nswollen sodden boots and a hat like them, was called out of a boat\nand whispered with Mr. Bucket, who went away with him down some\nslippery steps--as if to look at something secret that he had to\nshow. They came back, wiping their hands upon their coats, after\nturning over something wet; but thank God it was not what I feared!\n\nAfter some further conference, Mr. Bucket (whom everybody seemed to\nknow and defer to) went in with the others at a door and left me in\nthe carriage, while the driver walked up and down by his horses to\nwarm himself. The tide was coming in, as I judged from the sound it\nmade, and I could hear it break at the end of the alley with a little\nrush towards me. It never did so--and I thought it did so, hundreds\nof times, in what can have been at the most a quarter of an hour, and\nprobably was less--but the thought shuddered through me that it would\ncast my mother at the horses' feet.\n\nMr. Bucket came out again, exhorting the others to be vigilant,\ndarkened his lantern, and once more took his seat. \"Don't you be\nalarmed, Miss Summerson, on account of our coming down here,\" he\nsaid, turning to me. \"I only want to have everything in train and to\nknow that it is in train by looking after it myself. Get on, my lad!\"\n\nWe appeared to retrace the way we had come. Not that I had taken note\nof any particular objects in my perturbed state of mind, but judging\nfrom the general character of the streets. We called at another\noffice or station for a minute and crossed the river again. During\nthe whole of this time, and during the whole search, my companion,\nwrapped up on the box, never relaxed in his vigilance a single\nmoment; but when we crossed the bridge he seemed, if possible, to be\nmore on the alert than before. He stood up to look over the parapet,\nhe alighted and went back after a shadowy female figure that flitted\npast us, and he gazed into the profound black pit of water with a\nface that made my heart die within me. The river had a fearful look,\nso overcast and secret, creeping away so fast between the low flat\nlines of shore--so heavy with indistinct and awful shapes, both of\nsubstance and shadow; so death-like and mysterious. I have seen it\nmany times since then, by sunlight and by moonlight, but never free\nfrom the impressions of that journey. In my memory the lights upon\nthe bridge are always burning dim, the cutting wind is eddying round\nthe homeless woman whom we pass, the monotonous wheels are whirling\non, and the light of the carriage-lamps reflected back looks palely\nin upon me--a face rising out of the dreaded water.\n\nClattering and clattering through the empty streets, we came at\nlength from the pavement on to dark smooth roads and began to leave\nthe houses behind us. After a while I recognized the familiar way to\nSaint Albans. At Barnet fresh horses were ready for us, and we\nchanged and went on. It was very cold indeed, and the open country\nwas white with snow, though none was falling then.\n\n\"An old acquaintance of yours, this road, Miss Summerson,\" said Mr.\nBucket cheerfully.\n\n\"Yes,\" I returned. \"Have you gathered any intelligence?\"\n\n\"None that can be quite depended on as yet,\" he answered, \"but it's\nearly times as yet.\"\n\nHe had gone into every late or early public-house where there\nwas a light (they were not a few at that time, the road being\nthen much frequented by drovers) and had got down to talk to the\nturnpike-keepers. I had heard him ordering drink, and chinking money,\nand making himself agreeable and merry everywhere; but whenever he\ntook his seat upon the box again, his face resumed its watchful\nsteady look, and he always said to the driver in the same business\ntone, \"Get on, my lad!\"\n\nWith all these stoppages, it was between five and six o'clock and we\nwere yet a few miles short of Saint Albans when he came out of one of\nthese houses and handed me in a cup of tea.\n\n\"Drink it, Miss Summerson, it'll do you good. You're beginning to get\nmore yourself now, ain't you?\"\n\nI thanked him and said I hoped so.\n\n\"You was what you may call stunned at first,\" he returned; \"and Lord,\nno wonder! Don't speak loud, my dear. It's all right. She's on\nahead.\"\n\nI don't know what joyful exclamation I made or was going to make, but\nhe put up his finger and I stopped myself.\n\n\"Passed through here on foot this evening about eight or nine. I\nheard of her first at the archway toll, over at Highgate, but\ncouldn't make quite sure. Traced her all along, on and off. Picked\nher up at one place, and dropped her at another; but she's before us\nnow, safe. Take hold of this cup and saucer, ostler. Now, if you\nwasn't brought up to the butter trade, look out and see if you can\ncatch half a crown in your t'other hand. One, two, three, and there\nyou are! Now, my lad, try a gallop!\"\n\nWe were soon in Saint Albans and alighted a little before day, when I\nwas just beginning to arrange and comprehend the occurrences of the\nnight and really to believe that they were not a dream. Leaving the\ncarriage at the posting-house and ordering fresh horses to be ready,\nmy companion gave me his arm, and we went towards home.\n\n\"As this is your regular abode, Miss Summerson, you see,\" he\nobserved, \"I should like to know whether you've been asked for by any\nstranger answering the description, or whether Mr. Jarndyce has. I\ndon't much expect it, but it might be.\"\n\nAs we ascended the hill, he looked about him with a sharp eye--the\nday was now breaking--and reminded me that I had come down it one\nnight, as I had reason for remembering, with my little servant and\npoor Jo, whom he called Toughey.\n\nI wondered how he knew that.\n\n\"When you passed a man upon the road, just yonder, you know,\" said\nMr. Bucket.\n\nYes, I remembered that too, very well.\n\n\"That was me,\" said Mr. Bucket.\n\nSeeing my surprise, he went on, \"I drove down in a gig that afternoon\nto look after that boy. You might have heard my wheels when you came\nout to look after him yourself, for I was aware of you and your\nlittle maid going up when I was walking the horse down. Making an\ninquiry or two about him in the town, I soon heard what company he\nwas in and was coming among the brick-fields to look for him when I\nobserved you bringing him home here.\"\n\n\"Had he committed any crime?\" I asked.\n\n\"None was charged against him,\" said Mr. Bucket, coolly lifting off\nhis hat, \"but I suppose he wasn't over-particular. No. What I wanted\nhim for was in connexion with keeping this very matter of Lady\nDedlock quiet. He had been making his tongue more free than welcome\nas to a small accidental service he had been paid for by the deceased\nMr. Tulkinghorn; and it wouldn't do, at any sort of price, to have\nhim playing those games. So having warned him out of London, I made\nan afternoon of it to warn him to keep out of it now he WAS away, and\ngo farther from it, and maintain a bright look-out that I didn't\ncatch him coming back again.\"\n\n\"Poor creature!\" said I.\n\n\"Poor enough,\" assented Mr. Bucket, \"and trouble enough, and well\nenough away from London, or anywhere else. I was regularly turned on\nmy back when I found him taken up by your establishment, I do assure\nyou.\"\n\nI asked him why. \"Why, my dear?\" said Mr. Bucket. \"Naturally there\nwas no end to his tongue then. He might as well have been born with a\nyard and a half of it, and a remnant over.\"\n\nAlthough I remember this conversation now, my head was in confusion\nat the time, and my power of attention hardly did more than enable me\nto understand that he entered into these particulars to divert me.\nWith the same kind intention, manifestly, he often spoke to me of\nindifferent things, while his face was busy with the one object that\nwe had in view. He still pursued this subject as we turned in at the\ngarden-gate.\n\n\"Ah!\" said Mr. Bucket. \"Here we are, and a nice retired place it is.\nPuts a man in mind of the country house in the Woodpecker-tapping,\nthat was known by the smoke which so gracefully curled. They're early\nwith the kitchen fire, and that denotes good servants. But what\nyou've always got to be careful of with servants is who comes to see\n'em; you never know what they're up to if you don't know that. And\nanother thing, my dear. Whenever you find a young man behind the\nkitchen-door, you give that young man in charge on suspicion of being\nsecreted in a dwelling-house with an unlawful purpose.\"\n\nWe were now in front of the house; he looked attentively and closely\nat the gravel for footprints before he raised his eyes to the\nwindows.\n\n\"Do you generally put that elderly young gentleman in the same room\nwhen he's on a visit here, Miss Summerson?\" he inquired, glancing at\nMr. Skimpole's usual chamber.\n\n\"You know Mr. Skimpole!\" said I.\n\n\"What do you call him again?\" returned Mr. Bucket, bending down his\near. \"Skimpole, is it? I've often wondered what his name might be.\nSkimpole. Not John, I should say, nor yet Jacob?\"\n\n\"Harold,\" I told him.\n\n\"Harold. Yes. He's a queer bird is Harold,\" said Mr. Bucket, eyeing\nme with great expression.\n\n\"He is a singular character,\" said I.\n\n\"No idea of money,\" observed Mr. Bucket. \"He takes it, though!\"\n\nI involuntarily returned for answer that I perceived Mr. Bucket knew\nhim.\n\n\"Why, now I'll tell you, Miss Summerson,\" he replied. \"Your mind will\nbe all the better for not running on one point too continually, and\nI'll tell you for a change. It was him as pointed out to me where\nToughey was. I made up my mind that night to come to the door and ask\nfor Toughey, if that was all; but willing to try a move or so first,\nif any such was on the board, I just pitched up a morsel of gravel at\nthat window where I saw a shadow. As soon as Harold opens it and I\nhave had a look at him, thinks I, you're the man for me. So I\nsmoothed him down a bit about not wanting to disturb the family after\nthey was gone to bed and about its being a thing to be regretted that\ncharitable young ladies should harbour vagrants; and then, when I\npretty well understood his ways, I said I should consider a fypunnote\nwell bestowed if I could relieve the premises of Toughey without\ncausing any noise or trouble. Then says he, lifting up his eyebrows\nin the gayest way, 'It's no use mentioning a fypunnote to me, my\nfriend, because I'm a mere child in such matters and have no idea of\nmoney.' Of course I understood what his taking it so easy meant; and\nbeing now quite sure he was the man for me, I wrapped the note round\na little stone and threw it up to him. Well! He laughs and beams, and\nlooks as innocent as you like, and says, 'But I don't know the value\nof these things. What am I to DO with this?' 'Spend it, sir,' says I.\n'But I shall be taken in,' he says, 'they won't give me the right\nchange, I shall lose it, it's no use to me.' Lord, you never saw such\na face as he carried it with! Of course he told me where to find\nToughey, and I found him.\"\n\nI regarded this as very treacherous on the part of Mr. Skimpole\ntowards my guardian and as passing the usual bounds of his childish\ninnocence.\n\n\"Bounds, my dear?\" returned Mr. Bucket. \"Bounds? Now, Miss Summerson,\nI'll give you a piece of advice that your husband will find useful\nwhen you are happily married and have got a family about you.\nWhenever a person says to you that they are as innocent as can be in\nall concerning money, look well after your own money, for they are\ndead certain to collar it if they can. Whenever a person proclaims to\nyou 'In worldly matters I'm a child,' you consider that that person\nis only a-crying off from being held accountable and that you have\ngot that person's number, and it's Number One. Now, I am not a\npoetical man myself, except in a vocal way when it goes round a\ncompany, but I'm a practical one, and that's my experience. So's this\nrule. Fast and loose in one thing, fast and loose in everything. I\nnever knew it fail. No more will you. Nor no one. With which caution\nto the unwary, my dear, I take the liberty of pulling this here bell,\nand so go back to our business.\"\n\nI believe it had not been for a moment out of his mind, any more than\nit had been out of my mind, or out of his face. The whole household\nwere amazed to see me, without any notice, at that time in the\nmorning, and so accompanied; and their surprise was not diminished by\nmy inquiries. No one, however, had been there. It could not be\ndoubted that this was the truth.\n\n\"Then, Miss Summerson,\" said my companion, \"we can't be too soon at\nthe cottage where those brickmakers are to be found. Most inquiries\nthere I leave to you, if you'll be so good as to make 'em. The\nnaturalest way is the best way, and the naturalest way is your own\nway.\"\n\nWe set off again immediately. On arriving at the cottage, we found it\nshut up and apparently deserted, but one of the neighbours who knew\nme and who came out when I was trying to make some one hear informed\nme that the two women and their husbands now lived together in\nanother house, made of loose rough bricks, which stood on the margin\nof the piece of ground where the kilns were and where the long rows\nof bricks were drying. We lost no time in repairing to this place,\nwhich was within a few hundred yards; and as the door stood ajar, I\npushed it open.\n\nThere were only three of them sitting at breakfast, the child lying\nasleep on a bed in the corner. It was Jenny, the mother of the dead\nchild, who was absent. The other woman rose on seeing me; and the\nmen, though they were, as usual, sulky and silent, each gave me a\nmorose nod of recognition. A look passed between them when Mr. Bucket\nfollowed me in, and I was surprised to see that the woman evidently\nknew him.\n\nI had asked leave to enter of course. Liz (the only name by which I\nknew her) rose to give me her own chair, but I sat down on a stool\nnear the fire, and Mr. Bucket took a corner of the bedstead. Now that\nI had to speak and was among people with whom I was not familiar, I\nbecame conscious of being hurried and giddy. It was very difficult to\nbegin, and I could not help bursting into tears.\n\n\"Liz,\" said I, \"I have come a long way in the night and through the\nsnow to inquire after a lady--\"\n\n\"Who has been here, you know,\" Mr. Bucket struck in, addressing the\nwhole group with a composed propitiatory face; \"that's the lady the\nyoung lady means. The lady that was here last night, you know.\"\n\n\"And who told YOU as there was anybody here?\" inquired Jenny's\nhusband, who had made a surly stop in his eating to listen and now\nmeasured him with his eye.\n\n\"A person of the name of Michael Jackson, with a blue welveteen\nwaistcoat with a double row of mother of pearl buttons,\" Mr. Bucket\nimmediately answered.\n\n\"He had as good mind his own business, whoever he is,\" growled the\nman.\n\n\"He's out of employment, I believe,\" said Mr. Bucket apologetically\nfor Michael Jackson, \"and so gets talking.\"\n\nThe woman had not resumed her chair, but stood faltering with her\nhand upon its broken back, looking at me. I thought she would have\nspoken to me privately if she had dared. She was still in this\nattitude of uncertainty when her husband, who was eating with a lump\nof bread and fat in one hand and his clasp-knife in the other, struck\nthe handle of his knife violently on the table and told her with an\noath to mind HER own business at any rate and sit down.\n\n\"I should like to have seen Jenny very much,\" said I, \"for I am sure\nshe would have told me all she could about this lady, whom I am very\nanxious indeed--you cannot think how anxious--to overtake. Will Jenny\nbe here soon? Where is she?\"\n\nThe woman had a great desire to answer, but the man, with another\noath, openly kicked at her foot with his heavy boot. He left it to\nJenny's husband to say what he chose, and after a dogged silence the\nlatter turned his shaggy head towards me.\n\n\"I'm not partial to gentlefolks coming into my place, as you've heerd\nme say afore now, I think, miss. I let their places be, and it's\ncurious they can't let my place be. There'd be a pretty shine made if\nI was to go a-wisitin THEM, I think. Howsoever, I don't so much\ncomplain of you as of some others, and I'm agreeable to make you a\ncivil answer, though I give notice that I'm not a-going to be drawed\nlike a badger. Will Jenny be here soon? No she won't. Where is she?\nShe's gone up to Lunnun.\"\n\n\"Did she go last night?\" I asked.\n\n\"Did she go last night? Ah! She went last night,\" he answered with a\nsulky jerk of his head.\n\n\"But was she here when the lady came? And what did the lady say to\nher? And where is the lady gone? I beg and pray you to be so kind as\nto tell me,\" said I, \"for I am in great distress to know.\"\n\n\"If my master would let me speak, and not say a word of harm--\" the\nwoman timidly began.\n\n\"Your master,\" said her husband, muttering an imprecation with slow\nemphasis, \"will break your neck if you meddle with wot don't concern\nyou.\"\n\nAfter another silence, the husband of the absent woman, turning to me\nagain, answered me with his usual grumbling unwillingness.\n\n\"Wos Jenny here when the lady come? Yes, she wos here when the lady\ncome. Wot did the lady say to her? Well, I'll tell you wot the lady\nsaid to her. She said, 'You remember me as come one time to talk to\nyou about the young lady as had been a-wisiting of you? You remember\nme as give you somethink handsome for a handkercher wot she had\nleft?' Ah, she remembered. So we all did. Well, then, wos that young\nlady up at the house now? No, she warn't up at the house now. Well,\nthen, lookee here. The lady was upon a journey all alone, strange as\nwe might think it, and could she rest herself where you're a setten\nfor a hour or so. Yes she could, and so she did. Then she went--it\nmight be at twenty minutes past eleven, and it might be at twenty\nminutes past twelve; we ain't got no watches here to know the time\nby, nor yet clocks. Where did she go? I don't know where she go'd.\nShe went one way, and Jenny went another; one went right to Lunnun,\nand t'other went right from it. That's all about it. Ask this man. He\nheerd it all, and see it all. He knows.\"\n\nThe other man repeated, \"That's all about it.\"\n\n\"Was the lady crying?\" I inquired.\n\n\"Devil a bit,\" returned the first man. \"Her shoes was the worse, and\nher clothes was the worse, but she warn't--not as I see.\"\n\nThe woman sat with her arms crossed and her eyes upon the ground. Her\nhusband had turned his seat a little so as to face her and kept his\nhammer-like hand upon the table as if it were in readiness to execute\nhis threat if she disobeyed him.\n\n\"I hope you will not object to my asking your wife,\" said I, \"how the\nlady looked.\"\n\n\"Come, then!\" he gruffly cried to her. \"You hear what she says. Cut\nit short and tell her.\"\n\n\"Bad,\" replied the woman. \"Pale and exhausted. Very bad.\"\n\n\"Did she speak much?\"\n\n\"Not much, but her voice was hoarse.\"\n\nShe answered, looking all the while at her husband for leave.\n\n\"Was she faint?\" said I. \"Did she eat or drink here?\"\n\n\"Go on!\" said the husband in answer to her look. \"Tell her and cut it\nshort.\"\n\n\"She had a little water, miss, and Jenny fetched her some bread and\ntea. But she hardly touched it.\"\n\n\"And when she went from here,\" I was proceeding, when Jenny's husband\nimpatiently took me up.\n\n\"When she went from here, she went right away nor'ard by the high\nroad. Ask on the road if you doubt me, and see if it warn't so. Now,\nthere's the end. That's all about it.\"\n\nI glanced at my companion, and finding that he had already risen and\nwas ready to depart, thanked them for what they had told me, and took\nmy leave. The woman looked full at Mr. Bucket as he went out, and he\nlooked full at her.\n\n\"Now, Miss Summerson,\" he said to me as we walked quickly away.\n\"They've got her ladyship's watch among 'em. That's a positive fact.\"\n\n\"You saw it?\" I exclaimed.\n\n\"Just as good as saw it,\" he returned. \"Else why should he talk about\nhis 'twenty minutes past' and about his having no watch to tell the\ntime by? Twenty minutes! He don't usually cut his time so fine as\nthat. If he comes to half-hours, it's as much as HE does. Now, you\nsee, either her ladyship gave him that watch or he took it. I think\nshe gave it him. Now, what should she give it him for? What should\nshe give it him for?\"\n\nHe repeated this question to himself several times as we hurried on,\nappearing to balance between a variety of answers that arose in his\nmind.\n\n\"If time could be spared,\" said Mr. Bucket, \"which is the only thing\nthat can't be spared in this case, I might get it out of that woman;\nbut it's too doubtful a chance to trust to under present\ncircumstances. They are up to keeping a close eye upon her, and any\nfool knows that a poor creetur like her, beaten and kicked and\nscarred and bruised from head to foot, will stand by the husband that\nill uses her through thick and thin. There's something kept back.\nIt's a pity but what we had seen the other woman.\"\n\nI regretted it exceedingly, for she was very grateful, and I felt\nsure would have resisted no entreaty of mine.\n\n\"It's possible, Miss Summerson,\" said Mr. Bucket, pondering on it,\n\"that her ladyship sent her up to London with some word for you, and\nit's possible that her husband got the watch to let her go. It don't\ncome out altogether so plain as to please me, but it's on the cards.\nNow, I don't take kindly to laying out the money of Sir Leicester\nDedlock, Baronet, on these roughs, and I don't see my way to the\nusefulness of it at present. No! So far our road, Miss Summerson, is\nfor'ard--straight ahead--and keeping everything quiet!\"\n\nWe called at home once more that I might send a hasty note to my\nguardian, and then we hurried back to where we had left the carriage.\nThe horses were brought out as soon as we were seen coming, and we\nwere on the road again in a few minutes.\n\nIt had set in snowing at daybreak, and it now snowed hard. The air\nwas so thick with the darkness of the day and the density of the fall\nthat we could see but a very little way in any direction. Although it\nwas extremely cold, the snow was but partially frozen, and it\nchurned--with a sound as if it were a beach of small shells--under\nthe hoofs of the horses into mire and water. They sometimes slipped\nand floundered for a mile together, and we were obliged to come to a\nstandstill to rest them. One horse fell three times in this first\nstage, and trembled so and was so shaken that the driver had to\ndismount from his saddle and lead him at last.\n\nI could eat nothing and could not sleep, and I grew so nervous under\nthose delays and the slow pace at which we travelled that I had an\nunreasonable desire upon me to get out and walk. Yielding to my\ncompanion's better sense, however, I remained where I was. All this\ntime, kept fresh by a certain enjoyment of the work in which he was\nengaged, he was up and down at every house we came to, addressing\npeople whom he had never beheld before as old acquaintances, running\nin to warm himself at every fire he saw, talking and drinking and\nshaking hands at every bar and tap, friendly with every waggoner,\nwheelwright, blacksmith, and toll-taker, yet never seeming to lose\ntime, and always mounting to the box again with his watchful, steady\nface and his business-like \"Get on, my lad!\"\n\nWhen we were changing horses the next time, he came from the\nstable-yard, with the wet snow encrusted upon him and dropping off\nhim--plashing and crashing through it to his wet knees as he had been\ndoing frequently since we left Saint Albans--and spoke to me at the\ncarriage side.\n\n\"Keep up your spirits. It's certainly true that she came on here,\nMiss Summerson. There's not a doubt of the dress by this time, and\nthe dress has been seen here.\"\n\n\"Still on foot?\" said I.\n\n\"Still on foot. I think the gentleman you mentioned must be the point\nshe's aiming at, and yet I don't like his living down in her own part\nof the country neither.\"\n\n\"I know so little,\" said I. \"There may be some one else nearer here,\nof whom I never heard.\"\n\n\"That's true. But whatever you do, don't you fall a-crying, my dear;\nand don't you worry yourself no more than you can help. Get on, my\nlad!\"\n\nThe sleet fell all that day unceasingly, a thick mist came on early,\nand it never rose or lightened for a moment. Such roads I had never\nseen. I sometimes feared we had missed the way and got into the\nploughed grounds or the marshes. If I ever thought of the time I had\nbeen out, it presented itself as an indefinite period of great\nduration, and I seemed, in a strange way, never to have been free\nfrom the anxiety under which I then laboured.\n\nAs we advanced, I began to feel misgivings that my companion lost\nconfidence. He was the same as before with all the roadside people,\nbut he looked graver when he sat by himself on the box. I saw his\nfinger uneasily going across and across his mouth during the whole of\none long weary stage. I overheard that he began to ask the drivers of\ncoaches and other vehicles coming towards us what passengers they had\nseen in other coaches and vehicles that were in advance. Their\nreplies did not encourage him. He always gave me a reassuring beck of\nhis finger and lift of his eyelid as he got upon the box again, but\nhe seemed perplexed now when he said, \"Get on, my lad!\"\n\nAt last, when we were changing, he told me that he had lost the track\nof the dress so long that he began to be surprised. It was nothing,\nhe said, to lose such a track for one while, and to take it up for\nanother while, and so on; but it had disappeared here in an\nunaccountable manner, and we had not come upon it since. This\ncorroborated the apprehensions I had formed, when he began to look at\ndirection-posts, and to leave the carriage at cross roads for a\nquarter of an hour at a time while he explored them. But I was not to\nbe down-hearted, he told me, for it was as likely as not that the\nnext stage might set us right again.\n\nThe next stage, however, ended as that one ended; we had no new clue.\nThere was a spacious inn here, solitary, but a comfortable\nsubstantial building, and as we drove in under a large gateway before\nI knew it, where a landlady and her pretty daughters came to the\ncarriage-door, entreating me to alight and refresh myself while the\nhorses were making ready, I thought it would be uncharitable to\nrefuse. They took me upstairs to a warm room and left me there.\n\nIt was at the corner of the house, I remember, looking two ways. On\none side to a stable-yard open to a by-road, where the ostlers were\nunharnessing the splashed and tired horses from the muddy carriage,\nand beyond that to the by-road itself, across which the sign was\nheavily swinging; on the other side to a wood of dark pine-trees.\nTheir branches were encumbered with snow, and it silently dropped off\nin wet heaps while I stood at the window. Night was setting in, and\nits bleakness was enhanced by the contrast of the pictured fire\nglowing and gleaming in the window-pane. As I looked among the stems\nof the trees and followed the discoloured marks in the snow where the\nthaw was sinking into it and undermining it, I thought of the\nmotherly face brightly set off by daughters that had just now\nwelcomed me and of MY mother lying down in such a wood to die.\n\nI was frightened when I found them all about me, but I remembered\nthat before I fainted I tried very hard not to do it; and that was\nsome little comfort. They cushioned me up on a large sofa by the\nfire, and then the comely landlady told me that I must travel no\nfurther to-night, but must go to bed. But this put me into such a\ntremble lest they should detain me there that she soon recalled her\nwords and compromised for a rest of half an hour.\n\nA good endearing creature she was. She and her three fair girls, all\nso busy about me. I was to take hot soup and broiled fowl, while Mr.\nBucket dried himself and dined elsewhere; but I could not do it when\na snug round table was presently spread by the fireside, though I was\nvery unwilling to disappoint them. However, I could take some toast\nand some hot negus, and as I really enjoyed that refreshment, it made\nsome recompense.\n\nPunctual to the time, at the half-hour's end the carriage came\nrumbling under the gateway, and they took me down, warmed, refreshed,\ncomforted by kindness, and safe (I assured them) not to faint any\nmore. After I had got in and had taken a grateful leave of them all,\nthe youngest daughter--a blooming girl of nineteen, who was to be the\nfirst married, they had told me--got upon the carriage step, reached\nin, and kissed me. I have never seen her, from that hour, but I think\nof her to this hour as my friend.\n\nThe transparent windows with the fire and light, looking so bright\nand warm from the cold darkness out of doors, were soon gone, and\nagain we were crushing and churning the loose snow. We went on with\ntoil enough, but the dismal roads were not much worse than they had\nbeen, and the stage was only nine miles. My companion smoking on the\nbox--I had thought at the last inn of begging him to do so when I saw\nhim standing at a great fire in a comfortable cloud of tobacco--was\nas vigilant as ever and as quickly down and up again when we came to\nany human abode or any human creature. He had lighted his little dark\nlantern, which seemed to be a favourite with him, for we had lamps to\nthe carriage; and every now and then he turned it upon me to see that\nI was doing well. There was a folding-window to the carriage-head,\nbut I never closed it, for it seemed like shutting out hope.\n\nWe came to the end of the stage, and still the lost trace was not\nrecovered. I looked at him anxiously when we stopped to change, but I\nknew by his yet graver face as he stood watching the ostlers that he\nhad heard nothing. Almost in an instant afterwards, as I leaned back\nin my seat, he looked in, with his lighted lantern in his hand, an\nexcited and quite different man.\n\n\"What is it?\" said I, starting. \"Is she here?\"\n\n\"No, no. Don't deceive yourself, my dear. Nobody's here. But I've got\nit!\"\n\nThe crystallized snow was in his eyelashes, in his hair, lying in\nridges on his dress. He had to shake it from his face and get his\nbreath before he spoke to me.\n\n\"Now, Miss Summerson,\" said he, beating his finger on the apron,\n\"don't you be disappointed at what I'm a-going to do. You know me.\nI'm Inspector Bucket, and you can trust me. We've come a long way;\nnever mind. Four horses out there for the next stage up! Quick!\"\n\nThere was a commotion in the yard, and a man came running out of the\nstables to know if he meant up or down.\n\n\"Up, I tell you! Up! Ain't it English? Up!\"\n\n\"Up?\" said I, astonished. \"To London! Are we going back?\"\n\n\"Miss Summerson,\" he answered, \"back. Straight back as a die. You\nknow me. Don't be afraid. I'll follow the other, by G----\"\n\n\"The other?\" I repeated. \"Who?\"\n\n\"You called her Jenny, didn't you? I'll follow her. Bring those two\npair out here for a crown a man. Wake up, some of you!\"\n\n\"You will not desert this lady we are in search of; you will not\nabandon her on such a night and in such a state of mind as I know her\nto be in!\" said I, in an agony, and grasping his hand.\n\n\"You are right, my dear, I won't. But I'll follow the other. Look\nalive here with them horses. Send a man for'ard in the saddle to the\nnext stage, and let him send another for'ard again, and order four\non, up, right through. My darling, don't you be afraid!\"\n\nThese orders and the way in which he ran about the yard urging them\ncaused a general excitement that was scarcely less bewildering to me\nthan the sudden change. But in the height of the confusion, a mounted\nman galloped away to order the relays, and our horses were put to\nwith great speed.\n\n\"My dear,\" said Mr. Bucket, jumping to his seat and looking in again,\n\"--you'll excuse me if I'm too familiar--don't you fret and worry\nyourself no more than you can help. I say nothing else at present;\nbut you know me, my dear; now, don't you?\"\n\nI endeavoured to say that I knew he was far more capable than I of\ndeciding what we ought to do, but was he sure that this was right?\nCould I not go forward by myself in search of--I grasped his hand\nagain in my distress and whispered it to him--of my own mother.\n\n\"My dear,\" he answered, \"I know, I know, and would I put you wrong,\ndo you think? Inspector Bucket. Now you know me, don't you?\"\n\nWhat could I say but yes!\n\n\"Then you keep up as good a heart as you can, and you rely upon me\nfor standing by you, no less than by Sir Leicester Dedlock, Baronet.\nNow, are you right there?\"\n\n\"All right, sir!\"\n\n\"Off she goes, then. And get on, my lads!\"\n\nWe were again upon the melancholy road by which we had come, tearing\nup the miry sleet and thawing snow as if they were torn up by a\nwaterwheel.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LVIII\n\nA Wintry Day and Night\n\n\nStill impassive, as behoves its breeding, the Dedlock town house\ncarries itself as usual towards the street of dismal grandeur. There\nare powdered heads from time to time in the little windows of the\nhall, looking out at the untaxed powder falling all day from the sky;\nand in the same conservatory there is peach blossom turning itself\nexotically to the great hall fire from the nipping weather out of\ndoors. It is given out that my Lady has gone down into Lincolnshire,\nbut is expected to return presently.\n\nRumour, busy overmuch, however, will not go down into Lincolnshire.\nIt persists in flitting and chattering about town. It knows that that\npoor unfortunate man, Sir Leicester, has been sadly used. It hears,\nmy dear child, all sorts of shocking things. It makes the world of\nfive miles round quite merry. Not to know that there is something\nwrong at the Dedlocks' is to augur yourself unknown. One of the\npeachy-cheeked charmers with the skeleton throats is already apprised\nof all the principal circumstances that will come out before the\nLords on Sir Leicester's application for a bill of divorce.\n\nAt Blaze and Sparkle's the jewellers and at Sheen and Gloss's the\nmercers, it is and will be for several hours the topic of the age,\nthe feature of the century. The patronesses of those establishments,\nalbeit so loftily inscrutable, being as nicely weighed and measured\nthere as any other article of the stock-in-trade, are perfectly\nunderstood in this new fashion by the rawest hand behind the counter.\n\"Our people, Mr. Jones,\" said Blaze and Sparkle to the hand in\nquestion on engaging him, \"our people, sir, are sheep--mere sheep.\nWhere two or three marked ones go, all the rest follow. Keep those\ntwo or three in your eye, Mr. Jones, and you have the flock.\" So,\nlikewise, Sheen and Gloss to THEIR Jones, in reference to knowing\nwhere to have the fashionable people and how to bring what they\n(Sheen and Gloss) choose into fashion. On similar unerring\nprinciples, Mr. Sladdery the librarian, and indeed the great farmer\nof gorgeous sheep, admits this very day, \"Why yes, sir, there\ncertainly ARE reports concerning Lady Dedlock, very current indeed\namong my high connexion, sir. You see, my high connexion must talk\nabout something, sir; and it's only to get a subject into vogue with\none or two ladies I could name to make it go down with the whole.\nJust what I should have done with those ladies, sir, in the case of\nany novelty you had left to me to bring in, they have done of\nthemselves in this case through knowing Lady Dedlock and being\nperhaps a little innocently jealous of her too, sir. You'll find,\nsir, that this topic will be very popular among my high connexion. If\nit had been a speculation, sir, it would have brought money. And when\nI say so, you may trust to my being right, sir, for I have made it my\nbusiness to study my high connexion and to be able to wind it up like\na clock, sir.\"\n\nThus rumour thrives in the capital, and will not go down into\nLincolnshire. By half-past five, post meridian, Horse Guards' time,\nit has even elicited a new remark from the Honourable Mr. Stables,\nwhich bids fair to outshine the old one, on which he has so long\nrested his colloquial reputation. This sparkling sally is to the\neffect that although he always knew she was the best-groomed woman in\nthe stud, he had no idea she was a bolter. It is immensely received\nin turf-circles.\n\nAt feasts and festivals also, in firmaments she has often graced, and\namong constellations she outshone but yesterday, she is still the\nprevalent subject. What is it? Who is it? When was it? Where was it?\nHow was it? She is discussed by her dear friends with all the\ngenteelest slang in vogue, with the last new word, the last new\nmanner, the last new drawl, and the perfection of polite\nindifference. A remarkable feature of the theme is that it is found\nto be so inspiring that several people come out upon it who never\ncame out before--positively say things! William Buffy carries one of\nthese smartnesses from the place where he dines down to the House,\nwhere the Whip for his party hands it about with his snuff-box to\nkeep men together who want to be off, with such effect that the\nSpeaker (who has had it privately insinuated into his own ear under\nthe corner of his wig) cries, \"Order at the bar!\" three times without\nmaking an impression.\n\nAnd not the least amazing circumstance connected with her being\nvaguely the town talk is that people hovering on the confines of Mr.\nSladdery's high connexion, people who know nothing and ever did know\nnothing about her, think it essential to their reputation to pretend\nthat she is their topic too, and to retail her at second-hand with\nthe last new word and the last new manner, and the last new drawl,\nand the last new polite indifference, and all the rest of it, all at\nsecond-hand but considered equal to new in inferior systems and to\nfainter stars. If there be any man of letters, art, or science among\nthese little dealers, how noble in him to support the feeble sisters\non such majestic crutches!\n\nSo goes the wintry day outside the Dedlock mansion. How within it?\n\nSir Leicester, lying in his bed, can speak a little, though with\ndifficulty and indistinctness. He is enjoined to silence and to rest,\nand they have given him some opiate to lull his pain, for his old\nenemy is very hard with him. He is never asleep, though sometimes he\nseems to fall into a dull waking doze. He caused his bedstead to be\nmoved out nearer to the window when he heard it was such inclement\nweather, and his head to be so adjusted that he could see the driving\nsnow and sleet. He watches it as it falls, throughout the whole\nwintry day.\n\nUpon the least noise in the house, which is kept hushed, his hand is\nat the pencil. The old housekeeper, sitting by him, knows what he\nwould write and whispers, \"No, he has not come back yet, Sir\nLeicester. It was late last night when he went. He has been but a\nlittle time gone yet.\"\n\nHe withdraws his hand and falls to looking at the sleet and snow\nagain until they seem, by being long looked at, to fall so thick and\nfast that he is obliged to close his eyes for a minute on the giddy\nwhirl of white flakes and icy blots.\n\nHe began to look at them as soon as it was light. The day is not yet\nfar spent when he conceives it to be necessary that her rooms should\nbe prepared for her. It is very cold and wet. Let there be good\nfires. Let them know that she is expected. Please see to it yourself.\nHe writes to this purpose on his slate, and Mrs. Rouncewell with a\nheavy heart obeys.\n\n\"For I dread, George,\" the old lady says to her son, who waits below\nto keep her company when she has a little leisure, \"I dread, my dear,\nthat my Lady will never more set foot within these walls.\"\n\n\"That's a bad presentiment, mother.\"\n\n\"Nor yet within the walls of Chesney Wold, my dear.\"\n\n\"That's worse. But why, mother?\"\n\n\"When I saw my Lady yesterday, George, she looked to me--and I may\nsay at me too--as if the step on the Ghost's Walk had almost walked\nher down.\"\n\n\"Come, come! You alarm yourself with old-story fears, mother.\"\n\n\"No I don't, my dear. No I don't. It's going on for sixty year that I\nhave been in this family, and I never had any fears for it before.\nBut it's breaking up, my dear; the great old Dedlock family is\nbreaking up.\"\n\n\"I hope not, mother.\"\n\n\"I am thankful I have lived long enough to be with Sir Leicester in\nthis illness and trouble, for I know I am not too old nor too useless\nto be a welcomer sight to him than anybody else in my place would be.\nBut the step on the Ghost's Walk will walk my Lady down, George; it\nhas been many a day behind her, and now it will pass her and go on.\"\n\n\"Well, mother dear, I say again, I hope not.\"\n\n\"Ah, so do I, George,\" the old lady returns, shaking her head and\nparting her folded hands. \"But if my fears come true, and he has to\nknow it, who will tell him!\"\n\n\"Are these her rooms?\"\n\n\"These are my Lady's rooms, just as she left them.\"\n\n\"Why, now,\" says the trooper, glancing round him and speaking in a\nlower voice, \"I begin to understand how you come to think as you do\nthink, mother. Rooms get an awful look about them when they are\nfitted up, like these, for one person you are used to see in them,\nand that person is away under any shadow, let alone being God knows\nwhere.\"\n\nHe is not far out. As all partings foreshadow the great final one,\nso, empty rooms, bereft of a familiar presence, mournfully whisper\nwhat your room and what mine must one day be. My Lady's state has a\nhollow look, thus gloomy and abandoned; and in the inner apartment,\nwhere Mr. Bucket last night made his secret perquisition, the traces\nof her dresses and her ornaments, even the mirrors accustomed to\nreflect them when they were a portion of herself, have a desolate and\nvacant air. Dark and cold as the wintry day is, it is darker and\ncolder in these deserted chambers than in many a hut that will barely\nexclude the weather; and though the servants heap fires in the grates\nand set the couches and the chairs within the warm glass screens that\nlet their ruddy light shoot through to the furthest corners, there is\na heavy cloud upon the rooms which no light will dispel.\n\nThe old housekeeper and her son remain until the preparations are\ncomplete, and then she returns upstairs. Volumnia has taken Mrs.\nRouncewell's place in the meantime, though pearl necklaces and rouge\npots, however calculated to embellish Bath, are but indifferent\ncomforts to the invalid under present circumstances. Volumnia, not\nbeing supposed to know (and indeed not knowing) what is the matter,\nhas found it a ticklish task to offer appropriate observations and\nconsequently has supplied their place with distracting smoothings of\nthe bed-linen, elaborate locomotion on tiptoe, vigilant peeping at\nher kinsman's eyes, and one exasperating whisper to herself of, \"He\nis asleep.\" In disproof of which superfluous remark Sir Leicester has\nindignantly written on the slate, \"I am not.\"\n\nYielding, therefore, the chair at the bedside to the quaint old\nhousekeeper, Volumnia sits at a table a little removed,\nsympathetically sighing. Sir Leicester watches the sleet and snow and\nlistens for the returning steps that he expects. In the ears of his\nold servant, looking as if she had stepped out of an old\npicture-frame to attend a summoned Dedlock to another world, the\nsilence is fraught with echoes of her own words, \"Who will tell him!\"\n\nHe has been under his valet's hands this morning to be made\npresentable and is as well got up as the circumstances will allow. He\nis propped with pillows, his grey hair is brushed in its usual\nmanner, his linen is arranged to a nicety, and he is wrapped in a\nresponsible dressing-gown. His eye-glass and his watch are ready to\nhis hand. It is necessary--less to his own dignity now perhaps than\nfor her sake--that he should be seen as little disturbed and as much\nhimself as may be. Women will talk, and Volumnia, though a Dedlock,\nis no exceptional case. He keeps her here, there is little doubt, to\nprevent her talking somewhere else. He is very ill, but he makes his\npresent stand against distress of mind and body most courageously.\n\nThe fair Volumnia, being one of those sprightly girls who cannot long\ncontinue silent without imminent peril of seizure by the dragon\nBoredom, soon indicates the approach of that monster with a series of\nundisguisable yawns. Finding it impossible to suppress those yawns by\nany other process than conversation, she compliments Mrs. Rouncewell\non her son, declaring that he positively is one of the finest figures\nshe ever saw and as soldierly a looking person, she should think, as\nwhat's his name, her favourite Life Guardsman--the man she dotes on,\nthe dearest of creatures--who was killed at Waterloo.\n\nSir Leicester hears this tribute with so much surprise and stares\nabout him in such a confused way that Mrs. Rouncewell feels it\nnecessary to explain.\n\n\"Miss Dedlock don't speak of my eldest son, Sir Leicester, but my\nyoungest. I have found him. He has come home.\"\n\nSir Leicester breaks silence with a harsh cry. \"George? Your son\nGeorge come home, Mrs. Rouncewell?\"\n\nThe old housekeeper wipes her eyes. \"Thank God. Yes, Sir Leicester.\"\n\nDoes this discovery of some one lost, this return of some one so long\ngone, come upon him as a strong confirmation of his hopes? Does he\nthink, \"Shall I not, with the aid I have, recall her safely after\nthis, there being fewer hours in her case than there are years in\nhis?\"\n\nIt is of no use entreating him; he is determined to speak now, and he\ndoes. In a thick crowd of sounds, but still intelligibly enough to be\nunderstood.\n\n\"Why did you not tell me, Mrs. Rouncewell?\"\n\n\"It happened only yesterday, Sir Leicester, and I doubted your being\nwell enough to be talked to of such things.\"\n\nBesides, the giddy Volumnia now remembers with her little scream that\nnobody was to have known of his being Mrs. Rouncewell's son and that\nshe was not to have told. But Mrs. Rouncewell protests, with warmth\nenough to swell the stomacher, that of course she would have told Sir\nLeicester as soon as he got better.\n\n\"Where is your son George, Mrs. Rouncewell?\" asks Sir Leicester,\n\nMrs. Rouncewell, not a little alarmed by his disregard of the\ndoctor's injunctions, replies, in London.\n\n\"Where in London?\"\n\nMrs. Rouncewell is constrained to admit that he is in the house.\n\n\"Bring him here to my room. Bring him directly.\"\n\nThe old lady can do nothing but go in search of him. Sir Leicester,\nwith such power of movement as he has, arranges himself a little to\nreceive him. When he has done so, he looks out again at the falling\nsleet and snow and listens again for the returning steps. A quantity\nof straw has been tumbled down in the street to deaden the noises\nthere, and she might be driven to the door perhaps without his\nhearing wheels.\n\nHe is lying thus, apparently forgetful of his newer and minor\nsurprise, when the housekeeper returns, accompanied by her trooper\nson. Mr. George approaches softly to the bedside, makes his bow,\nsquares his chest, and stands, with his face flushed, very heartily\nashamed of himself.\n\n\"Good heaven, and it is really George Rouncewell!\" exclaims Sir\nLeicester. \"Do you remember me, George?\"\n\nThe trooper needs to look at him and to separate this sound from that\nsound before he knows what he has said, but doing this and being a\nlittle helped by his mother, he replies, \"I must have a very bad\nmemory, indeed, Sir Leicester, if I failed to remember you.\"\n\n\"When I look at you, George Rouncewell,\" Sir Leicester observes with\ndifficulty, \"I see something of a boy at Chesney Wold--I remember\nwell--very well.\"\n\nHe looks at the trooper until tears come into his eyes, and then he\nlooks at the sleet and snow again.\n\n\"I ask your pardon, Sir Leicester,\" says the trooper, \"but would you\naccept of my arms to raise you up? You would lie easier, Sir\nLeicester, if you would allow me to move you.\"\n\n\"If you please, George Rouncewell; if you will be so good.\"\n\nThe trooper takes him in his arms like a child, lightly raises him,\nand turns him with his face more towards the window. \"Thank you. You\nhave your mother's gentleness,\" returns Sir Leicester, \"and your own\nstrength. Thank you.\"\n\nHe signs to him with his hand not to go away. George quietly remains\nat the bedside, waiting to be spoken to.\n\n\"Why did you wish for secrecy?\" It takes Sir Leicester some time to\nask this.\n\n\"Truly I am not much to boast of, Sir Leicester, and I--I should\nstill, Sir Leicester, if you was not so indisposed--which I hope you\nwill not be long--I should still hope for the favour of being allowed\nto remain unknown in general. That involves explanations not very\nhard to be guessed at, not very well timed here, and not very\ncreditable to myself. However opinions may differ on a variety of\nsubjects, I should think it would be universally agreed, Sir\nLeicester, that I am not much to boast of.\"\n\n\"You have been a soldier,\" observes Sir Leicester, \"and a faithful\none.\"\n\nGeorge makes his military bow. \"As far as that goes, Sir Leicester, I\nhave done my duty under discipline, and it was the least I could do.\"\n\n\"You find me,\" says Sir Leicester, whose eyes are much attracted\ntowards him, \"far from well, George Rouncewell.\"\n\n\"I am very sorry both to hear it and to see it, Sir Leicester.\"\n\n\"I am sure you are. No. In addition to my older malady, I have had a\nsudden and bad attack. Something that deadens,\" making an endeavour\nto pass one hand down one side, \"and confuses,\" touching his lips.\n\nGeorge, with a look of assent and sympathy, makes another bow. The\ndifferent times when they were both young men (the trooper much the\nyounger of the two) and looked at one another down at Chesney Wold\narise before them both and soften both.\n\nSir Leicester, evidently with a great determination to say, in his\nown manner, something that is on his mind before relapsing into\nsilence, tries to raise himself among his pillows a little more.\nGeorge, observant of the action, takes him in his arms again and\nplaces him as he desires to be. \"Thank you, George. You are another\nself to me. You have often carried my spare gun at Chesney Wold,\nGeorge. You are familiar to me in these strange circumstances, very\nfamiliar.\" He has put Sir Leicester's sounder arm over his shoulder\nin lifting him up, and Sir Leicester is slow in drawing it away again\nas he says these words.\n\n\"I was about to add,\" he presently goes on, \"I was about to add,\nrespecting this attack, that it was unfortunately simultaneous with a\nslight misunderstanding between my Lady and myself. I do not mean\nthat there was any difference between us (for there has been none),\nbut that there was a misunderstanding of certain circumstances\nimportant only to ourselves, which deprives me, for a little while,\nof my Lady's society. She has found it necessary to make a journey--I\ntrust will shortly return. Volumnia, do I make myself intelligible?\nThe words are not quite under my command in the manner of pronouncing\nthem.\"\n\nVolumnia understands him perfectly, and in truth he delivers himself\nwith far greater plainness than could have been supposed possible a\nminute ago. The effort by which he does so is written in the anxious\nand labouring expression of his face. Nothing but the strength of his\npurpose enables him to make it.\n\n\"Therefore, Volumnia, I desire to say in your presence--and in the\npresence of my old retainer and friend, Mrs. Rouncewell, whose truth\nand fidelity no one can question, and in the presence of her son\nGeorge, who comes back like a familiar recollection of my youth in\nthe home of my ancestors at Chesney Wold--in case I should relapse,\nin case I should not recover, in case I should lose both my speech\nand the power of writing, though I hope for better things--\"\n\nThe old housekeeper weeping silently; Volumnia in the greatest\nagitation, with the freshest bloom on her cheeks; the trooper with\nhis arms folded and his head a little bent, respectfully attentive.\n\n\"Therefore I desire to say, and to call you all to\nwitness--beginning, Volumnia, with yourself, most solemnly--that I am\non unaltered terms with Lady Dedlock. That I assert no cause whatever\nof complaint against her. That I have ever had the strongest\naffection for her, and that I retain it undiminished. Say this to\nherself, and to every one. If you ever say less than this, you will\nbe guilty of deliberate falsehood to me.\"\n\nVolumnia tremblingly protests that she will observe his injunctions\nto the letter.\n\n\"My Lady is too high in position, too handsome, too accomplished, too\nsuperior in most respects to the best of those by whom she is\nsurrounded, not to have her enemies and traducers, I dare say. Let it\nbe known to them, as I make it known to you, that being of sound\nmind, memory, and understanding, I revoke no disposition I have made\nin her favour. I abridge nothing I have ever bestowed upon her. I am\non unaltered terms with her, and I recall--having the full power to\ndo it if I were so disposed, as you see--no act I have done for her\nadvantage and happiness.\"\n\nHis formal array of words might have at any other time, as it has\noften had, something ludicrous in it, but at this time it is serious\nand affecting. His noble earnestness, his fidelity, his gallant\nshielding of her, his generous conquest of his own wrong and his own\npride for her sake, are simply honourable, manly, and true. Nothing\nless worthy can be seen through the lustre of such qualities in the\ncommonest mechanic, nothing less worthy can be seen in the best-born\ngentleman. In such a light both aspire alike, both rise alike, both\nchildren of the dust shine equally.\n\nOverpowered by his exertions, he lays his head back on his pillows\nand closes his eyes for not more than a minute, when he again resumes\nhis watching of the weather and his attention to the muffled sounds.\nIn the rendering of those little services, and in the manner of their\nacceptance, the trooper has become installed as necessary to him.\nNothing has been said, but it is quite understood. He falls a step or\ntwo backward to be out of sight and mounts guard a little behind his\nmother's chair.\n\nThe day is now beginning to decline. The mist and the sleet into\nwhich the snow has all resolved itself are darker, and the blaze\nbegins to tell more vividly upon the room walls and furniture. The\ngloom augments; the bright gas springs up in the streets; and the\npertinacious oil lamps which yet hold their ground there, with their\nsource of life half frozen and half thawed, twinkle gaspingly like\nfiery fish out of water--as they are. The world, which has been\nrumbling over the straw and pulling at the bell, \"to inquire,\" begins\nto go home, begins to dress, to dine, to discuss its dear friend with\nall the last new modes, as already mentioned.\n\nNow does Sir Leicester become worse, restless, uneasy, and in great\npain. Volumnia, lighting a candle (with a predestined aptitude for\ndoing something objectionable), is bidden to put it out again, for it\nis not yet dark enough. Yet it is very dark too, as dark as it will\nbe all night. By and by she tries again. No! Put it out. It is not\ndark enough yet.\n\nHis old housekeeper is the first to understand that he is striving to\nuphold the fiction with himself that it is not growing late.\n\n\"Dear Sir Leicester, my honoured master,\" she softly whispers, \"I\nmust, for your own good, and my duty, take the freedom of begging and\npraying that you will not lie here in the lone darkness watching and\nwaiting and dragging through the time. Let me draw the curtains, and\nlight the candles, and make things more comfortable about you. The\nchurch-clocks will strike the hours just the same, Sir Leicester, and\nthe night will pass away just the same. My Lady will come back, just\nthe same.\"\n\n\"I know it, Mrs. Rouncewell, but I am weak--and he has been so long\ngone.\"\n\n\"Not so very long, Sir Leicester. Not twenty-four hours yet.\"\n\n\"But that is a long time. Oh, it is a long time!\"\n\nHe says it with a groan that wrings her heart.\n\nShe knows that this is not a period for bringing the rough light upon\nhim; she thinks his tears too sacred to be seen, even by her.\nTherefore she sits in the darkness for a while without a word, then\ngently begins to move about, now stirring the fire, now standing at\nthe dark window looking out. Finally he tells her, with recovered\nself-command, \"As you say, Mrs. Rouncewell, it is no worse for being\nconfessed. It is getting late, and they are not come. Light the\nroom!\" When it is lighted and the weather shut out, it is only left\nto him to listen.\n\nBut they find that however dejected and ill he is, he brightens when\na quiet pretence is made of looking at the fires in her rooms and\nbeing sure that everything is ready to receive her. Poor pretence as\nit is, these allusions to her being expected keep up hope within him.\n\nMidnight comes, and with it the same blank. The carriages in the\nstreets are few, and other late sounds in that neighbourhood there\nare none, unless a man so very nomadically drunk as to stray into the\nfrigid zone goes brawling and bellowing along the pavement. Upon this\nwintry night it is so still that listening to the intense silence is\nlike looking at intense darkness. If any distant sound be audible in\nthis case, it departs through the gloom like a feeble light in that,\nand all is heavier than before.\n\nThe corporation of servants are dismissed to bed (not unwilling to\ngo, for they were up all last night), and only Mrs. Rouncewell and\nGeorge keep watch in Sir Leicester's room. As the night lags tardily\non--or rather when it seems to stop altogether, at between two and\nthree o'clock--they find a restless craving on him to know more about\nthe weather, now he cannot see it. Hence George, patrolling regularly\nevery half-hour to the rooms so carefully looked after, extends his\nmarch to the hall-door, looks about him, and brings back the best\nreport he can make of the worst of nights, the sleet still falling\nand even the stone footways lying ankle-deep in icy sludge.\n\nVolumnia, in her room up a retired landing on the staircase--the\nsecond turning past the end of the carving and gilding, a cousinly\nroom containing a fearful abortion of a portrait of Sir Leicester\nbanished for its crimes, and commanding in the day a solemn yard\nplanted with dried-up shrubs like antediluvian specimens of black\ntea--is a prey to horrors of many kinds. Not last nor least among\nthem, possibly, is a horror of what may befall her little income in\nthe event, as she expresses it, \"of anything happening\" to Sir\nLeicester. Anything, in this sense, meaning one thing only; and that\nthe last thing that can happen to the consciousness of any baronet in\nthe known world.\n\nAn effect of these horrors is that Volumnia finds she cannot go to\nbed in her own room or sit by the fire in her own room, but must come\nforth with her fair head tied up in a profusion of shawl, and her\nfair form enrobed in drapery, and parade the mansion like a ghost,\nparticularly haunting the rooms, warm and luxurious, prepared for one\nwho still does not return. Solitude under such circumstances being\nnot to be thought of, Volumnia is attended by her maid, who,\nimpressed from her own bed for that purpose, extremely cold, very\nsleepy, and generally an injured maid as condemned by circumstances\nto take office with a cousin, when she had resolved to be maid to\nnothing less than ten thousand a year, has not a sweet expression of\ncountenance.\n\nThe periodical visits of the trooper to these rooms, however, in the\ncourse of his patrolling is an assurance of protection and company\nboth to mistress and maid, which renders them very acceptable in the\nsmall hours of the night. Whenever he is heard advancing, they both\nmake some little decorative preparation to receive him; at other\ntimes they divide their watches into short scraps of oblivion and\ndialogues not wholly free from acerbity, as to whether Miss Dedlock,\nsitting with her feet upon the fender, was or was not falling into\nthe fire when rescued (to her great displeasure) by her guardian\ngenius the maid.\n\n\"How is Sir Leicester now, Mr. George?\" inquires Volumnia, adjusting\nher cowl over her head.\n\n\"Why, Sir Leicester is much the same, miss. He is very low and ill,\nand he even wanders a little sometimes.\"\n\n\"Has he asked for me?\" inquires Volumnia tenderly.\n\n\"Why, no, I can't say he has, miss. Not within my hearing, that is to\nsay.\"\n\n\"This is a truly sad time, Mr. George.\"\n\n\"It is indeed, miss. Hadn't you better go to bed?\"\n\n\"You had a deal better go to bed, Miss Dedlock,\" quoth the maid\nsharply.\n\nBut Volumnia answers No! No! She may be asked for, she may be wanted\nat a moment's notice. She never should forgive herself \"if anything\nwas to happen\" and she was not on the spot. She declines to enter on\nthe question, mooted by the maid, how the spot comes to be there, and\nnot in her room (which is nearer to Sir Leicester's), but staunchly\ndeclares that on the spot she will remain. Volumnia further makes a\nmerit of not having \"closed an eye\"--as if she had twenty or\nthirty--though it is hard to reconcile this statement with her having\nmost indisputably opened two within five minutes.\n\nBut when it comes to four o'clock, and still the same blank,\nVolumnia's constancy begins to fail her, or rather it begins to\nstrengthen, for she now considers that it is her duty to be ready for\nthe morrow, when much may be expected of her, that, in fact,\nhowsoever anxious to remain upon the spot, it may be required of her,\nas an act of self-devotion, to desert the spot. So when the trooper\nreappears with his, \"Hadn't you better go to bed, miss?\" and when the\nmaid protests, more sharply than before, \"You had a deal better go to\nbed, Miss Dedlock!\" she meekly rises and says, \"Do with me what you\nthink best!\"\n\nMr. George undoubtedly thinks it best to escort her on his arm to the\ndoor of her cousinly chamber, and the maid as undoubtedly thinks it\nbest to hustle her into bed with mighty little ceremony. Accordingly,\nthese steps are taken; and now the trooper, in his rounds, has the\nhouse to himself.\n\nThere is no improvement in the weather. From the portico, from the\neaves, from the parapet, from every ledge and post and pillar, drips\nthe thawed snow. It has crept, as if for shelter, into the lintels of\nthe great door--under it, into the corners of the windows, into every\nchink and crevice of retreat, and there wastes and dies. It is\nfalling still; upon the roof, upon the skylight, even through the\nskylight, and drip, drip, drip, with the regularity of the Ghost's\nWalk, on the stone floor below.\n\nThe trooper, his old recollections awakened by the solitary grandeur\nof a great house--no novelty to him once at Chesney Wold--goes up the\nstairs and through the chief rooms, holding up his light at arm's\nlength. Thinking of his varied fortunes within the last few weeks,\nand of his rustic boyhood, and of the two periods of his life so\nstrangely brought together across the wide intermediate space;\nthinking of the murdered man whose image is fresh in his mind;\nthinking of the lady who has disappeared from these very rooms and\nthe tokens of whose recent presence are all here; thinking of the\nmaster of the house upstairs and of the foreboding, \"Who will tell\nhim!\" he looks here and looks there, and reflects how he MIGHT see\nsomething now, which it would tax his boldness to walk up to, lay his\nhand upon, and prove to be a fancy. But it is all blank, blank as the\ndarkness above and below, while he goes up the great staircase again,\nblank as the oppressive silence.\n\n\"All is still in readiness, George Rouncewell?\"\n\n\"Quite orderly and right, Sir Leicester.\"\n\n\"No word of any kind?\"\n\nThe trooper shakes his head.\n\n\"No letter that can possibly have been overlooked?\"\n\nBut he knows there is no such hope as that and lays his head down\nwithout looking for an answer.\n\nVery familiar to him, as he said himself some hours ago, George\nRouncewell lifts him into easier positions through the long remainder\nof the blank wintry night, and equally familiar with his unexpressed\nwish, extinguishes the light and undraws the curtains at the first\nlate break of day. The day comes like a phantom. Cold, colourless,\nand vague, it sends a warning streak before it of a deathlike hue, as\nif it cried out, \"Look what I am bringing you who watch there! Who\nwill tell him!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LIX\n\nEsther's Narrative\n\n\nIt was three o'clock in the morning when the houses outside London\ndid at last begin to exclude the country and to close us in with\nstreets. We had made our way along roads in a far worse condition\nthan when we had traversed them by daylight, both the fall and the\nthaw having lasted ever since; but the energy of my companion never\nslackened. It had only been, as I thought, of less assistance than\nthe horses in getting us on, and it had often aided them. They had\nstopped exhausted half-way up hills, they had been driven through\nstreams of turbulent water, they had slipped down and become\nentangled with the harness; but he and his little lantern had been\nalways ready, and when the mishap was set right, I had never heard\nany variation in his cool, \"Get on, my lads!\"\n\nThe steadiness and confidence with which he had directed our journey\nback I could not account for. Never wavering, he never even stopped\nto make an inquiry until we were within a few miles of London. A very\nfew words, here and there, were then enough for him; and thus we\ncame, at between three and four o'clock in the morning, into\nIslington.\n\nI will not dwell on the suspense and anxiety with which I reflected\nall this time that we were leaving my mother farther and farther\nbehind every minute. I think I had some strong hope that he must be\nright and could not fail to have a satisfactory object in following\nthis woman, but I tormented myself with questioning it and discussing\nit during the whole journey. What was to ensue when we found her and\nwhat could compensate us for this loss of time were questions also\nthat I could not possibly dismiss; my mind was quite tortured by long\ndwelling on such reflections when we stopped.\n\nWe stopped in a high-street where there was a coach-stand. My\ncompanion paid our two drivers, who were as completely covered with\nsplashes as if they had been dragged along the roads like the\ncarriage itself, and giving them some brief direction where to take\nit, lifted me out of it and into a hackney-coach he had chosen from\nthe rest.\n\n\"Why, my dear!\" he said as he did this. \"How wet you are!\"\n\nI had not been conscious of it. But the melted snow had found its way\ninto the carriage, and I had got out two or three times when a fallen\nhorse was plunging and had to be got up, and the wet had penetrated\nmy dress. I assured him it was no matter, but the driver, who knew\nhim, would not be dissuaded by me from running down the street to his\nstable, whence he brought an armful of clean dry straw. They shook it\nout and strewed it well about me, and I found it warm and\ncomfortable.\n\n\"Now, my dear,\" said Mr. Bucket, with his head in at the window after\nI was shut up. \"We're a-going to mark this person down. It may take a\nlittle time, but you don't mind that. You're pretty sure that I've\ngot a motive. Ain't you?\"\n\nI little thought what it was, little thought in how short a time I\nshould understand it better, but I assured him that I had confidence\nin him.\n\n\"So you may have, my dear,\" he returned. \"And I tell you what! If you\nonly repose half as much confidence in me as I repose in you after\nwhat I've experienced of you, that'll do. Lord! You're no trouble at\nall. I never see a young woman in any station of society--and I've\nseen many elevated ones too--conduct herself like you have conducted\nyourself since you was called out of your bed. You're a pattern, you\nknow, that's what you are,\" said Mr. Bucket warmly; \"you're a\npattern.\"\n\nI told him I was very glad, as indeed I was, to have been no\nhindrance to him, and that I hoped I should be none now.\n\n\"My dear,\" he returned, \"when a young lady is as mild as she's game,\nand as game as she's mild, that's all I ask, and more than I expect.\nShe then becomes a queen, and that's about what you are yourself.\"\n\nWith these encouraging words--they really were encouraging to me\nunder those lonely and anxious circumstances--he got upon the box,\nand we once more drove away. Where we drove I neither knew then nor\nhave ever known since, but we appeared to seek out the narrowest and\nworst streets in London. Whenever I saw him directing the driver, I\nwas prepared for our descending into a deeper complication of such\nstreets, and we never failed to do so.\n\nSometimes we emerged upon a wider thoroughfare or came to a larger\nbuilding than the generality, well lighted. Then we stopped at\noffices like those we had visited when we began our journey, and I\nsaw him in consultation with others. Sometimes he would get down by\nan archway or at a street corner and mysteriously show the light of\nhis little lantern. This would attract similar lights from various\ndark quarters, like so many insects, and a fresh consultation would\nbe held. By degrees we appeared to contract our search within\nnarrower and easier limits. Single police-officers on duty could now\ntell Mr. Bucket what he wanted to know and point to him where to go.\nAt last we stopped for a rather long conversation between him and one\nof these men, which I supposed to be satisfactory from his manner of\nnodding from time to time. When it was finished he came to me looking\nvery busy and very attentive.\n\n\"Now, Miss Summerson,\" he said to me, \"you won't be alarmed whatever\ncomes off, I know. It's not necessary for me to give you any further\ncaution than to tell you that we have marked this person down and\nthat you may be of use to me before I know it myself. I don't like to\nask such a thing, my dear, but would you walk a little way?\"\n\nOf course I got out directly and took his arm.\n\n\"It ain't so easy to keep your feet,\" said Mr. Bucket, \"but take\ntime.\"\n\nAlthough I looked about me confusedly and hurriedly as we crossed the\nstreet, I thought I knew the place. \"Are we in Holborn?\" I asked him.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Mr. Bucket. \"Do you know this turning?\"\n\n\"It looks like Chancery Lane.\"\n\n\"And was christened so, my dear,\" said Mr. Bucket.\n\nWe turned down it, and as we went shuffling through the sleet, I\nheard the clocks strike half-past five. We passed on in silence and\nas quickly as we could with such a foot-hold, when some one coming\ntowards us on the narrow pavement, wrapped in a cloak, stopped and\nstood aside to give me room. In the same moment I heard an\nexclamation of wonder and my own name from Mr. Woodcourt. I knew his\nvoice very well.\n\nIt was so unexpected and so--I don't know what to call it, whether\npleasant or painful--to come upon it after my feverish wandering\njourney, and in the midst of the night, that I could not keep back\nthe tears from my eyes. It was like hearing his voice in a strange\ncountry.\n\n\"My dear Miss Summerson, that you should be out at this hour, and in\nsuch weather!\"\n\nHe had heard from my guardian of my having been called away on some\nuncommon business and said so to dispense with any explanation. I\ntold him that we had but just left a coach and were going--but then I\nwas obliged to look at my companion.\n\n\"Why, you see, Mr. Woodcourt\"--he had caught the name from me--\"we\nare a-going at present into the next street. Inspector Bucket.\"\n\nMr. Woodcourt, disregarding my remonstrances, had hurriedly taken off\nhis cloak and was putting it about me. \"That's a good move, too,\"\nsaid Mr. Bucket, assisting, \"a very good move.\"\n\n\"May I go with you?\" said Mr. Woodcourt. I don't know whether to me\nor to my companion.\n\n\"Why, Lord!\" exclaimed Mr. Bucket, taking the answer on himself. \"Of\ncourse you may.\"\n\nIt was all said in a moment, and they took me between them, wrapped\nin the cloak.\n\n\"I have just left Richard,\" said Mr. Woodcourt. \"I have been sitting\nwith him since ten o'clock last night.\"\n\n\"Oh, dear me, he is ill!\"\n\n\"No, no, believe me; not ill, but not quite well. He was depressed\nand faint--you know he gets so worried and so worn sometimes--and Ada\nsent to me of course; and when I came home I found her note and came\nstraight here. Well! Richard revived so much after a little while,\nand Ada was so happy and so convinced of its being my doing, though\nGod knows I had little enough to do with it, that I remained with him\nuntil he had been fast asleep some hours. As fast asleep as she is\nnow, I hope!\"\n\nHis friendly and familiar way of speaking of them, his unaffected\ndevotion to them, the grateful confidence with which I knew he had\ninspired my darling, and the comfort he was to her; could I separate\nall this from his promise to me? How thankless I must have been if it\nhad not recalled the words he said to me when he was so moved by the\nchange in my appearance: \"I will accept him as a trust, and it shall\nbe a sacred one!\"\n\nWe now turned into another narrow street. \"Mr. Woodcourt,\" said Mr.\nBucket, who had eyed him closely as we came along, \"our business\ntakes us to a law-stationer's here, a certain Mr. Snagsby's. What,\nyou know him, do you?\" He was so quick that he saw it in an instant.\n\n\"Yes, I know a little of him and have called upon him at this place.\"\n\n\"Indeed, sir?\" said Mr. Bucket. \"Then you will be so good as to let\nme leave Miss Summerson with you for a moment while I go and have\nhalf a word with him?\"\n\nThe last police-officer with whom he had conferred was standing\nsilently behind us. I was not aware of it until he struck in on my\nsaying I heard some one crying.\n\n\"Don't be alarmed, miss,\" he returned. \"It's Snagsby's servant.\"\n\n\"Why, you see,\" said Mr. Bucket, \"the girl's subject to fits, and has\n'em bad upon her to-night. A most contrary circumstance it is, for I\nwant certain information out of that girl, and she must be brought to\nreason somehow.\"\n\n\"At all events, they wouldn't be up yet if it wasn't for her, Mr.\nBucket,\" said the other man. \"She's been at it pretty well all night,\nsir.\"\n\n\"Well, that's true,\" he returned. \"My light's burnt out. Show yours a\nmoment.\"\n\nAll this passed in a whisper a door or two from the house in which I\ncould faintly hear crying and moaning. In the little round of light\nproduced for the purpose, Mr. Bucket went up to the door and knocked.\nThe door was opened after he had knocked twice, and he went in,\nleaving us standing in the street.\n\n\"Miss Summerson,\" said Mr. Woodcourt, \"if without obtruding myself on\nyour confidence I may remain near you, pray let me do so.\"\n\n\"You are truly kind,\" I answered. \"I need wish to keep no secret of\nmy own from you; if I keep any, it is another's.\"\n\n\"I quite understand. Trust me, I will remain near you only so long as\nI can fully respect it.\"\n\n\"I trust implicitly to you,\" I said. \"I know and deeply feel how\nsacredly you keep your promise.\"\n\nAfter a short time the little round of light shone out again, and Mr.\nBucket advanced towards us in it with his earnest face. \"Please to\ncome in, Miss Summerson,\" he said, \"and sit down by the fire. Mr.\nWoodcourt, from information I have received I understand you are a\nmedical man. Would you look to this girl and see if anything can be\ndone to bring her round. She has a letter somewhere that I\nparticularly want. It's not in her box, and I think it must be about\nher; but she is so twisted and clenched up that she is difficult to\nhandle without hurting.\"\n\nWe all three went into the house together; although it was cold and\nraw, it smelt close too from being up all night. In the passage\nbehind the door stood a scared, sorrowful-looking little man in a\ngrey coat who seemed to have a naturally polite manner and spoke\nmeekly.\n\n\"Downstairs, if you please, Mr. Bucket,\" said he. \"The lady will\nexcuse the front kitchen; we use it as our workaday sitting-room. The\nback is Guster's bedroom, and in it she's a-carrying on, poor thing,\nto a frightful extent!\"\n\nWe went downstairs, followed by Mr. Snagsby, as I soon found the\nlittle man to be. In the front kitchen, sitting by the fire, was Mrs.\nSnagsby, with very red eyes and a very severe expression of face.\n\n\"My little woman,\" said Mr. Snagsby, entering behind us, \"to\nwave--not to put too fine a point upon it, my dear--hostilities for\none single moment in the course of this prolonged night, here is\nInspector Bucket, Mr. Woodcourt, and a lady.\"\n\nShe looked very much astonished, as she had reason for doing, and\nlooked particularly hard at me.\n\n\"My little woman,\" said Mr. Snagsby, sitting down in the remotest\ncorner by the door, as if he were taking a liberty, \"it is not\nunlikely that you may inquire of me why Inspector Bucket, Mr.\nWoodcourt, and a lady call upon us in Cook's Court, Cursitor Street,\nat the present hour. I don't know. I have not the least idea. If I\nwas to be informed, I should despair of understanding, and I'd rather\nnot be told.\"\n\nHe appeared so miserable, sitting with his head upon his hand, and I\nappeared so unwelcome, that I was going to offer an apology when Mr.\nBucket took the matter on himself.\n\n\"Now, Mr. Snagsby,\" said he, \"the best thing you can do is to go\nalong with Mr. Woodcourt to look after your Guster--\"\n\n\"My Guster, Mr. Bucket!\" cried Mr. Snagsby. \"Go on, sir, go on. I\nshall be charged with that next.\"\n\n\"And to hold the candle,\" pursued Mr. Bucket without correcting\nhimself, \"or hold her, or make yourself useful in any way you're\nasked. Which there's not a man alive more ready to do, for you're a\nman of urbanity and suavity, you know, and you've got the sort of\nheart that can feel for another. Mr. Woodcourt, would you be so good\nas see to her, and if you can get that letter from her, to let me\nhave it as soon as ever you can?\"\n\nAs they went out, Mr. Bucket made me sit down in a corner by the fire\nand take off my wet shoes, which he turned up to dry upon the fender,\ntalking all the time.\n\n\"Don't you be at all put out, miss, by the want of a hospitable look\nfrom Mrs. Snagsby there, because she's under a mistake altogether.\nShe'll find that out sooner than will be agreeable to a lady of her\ngenerally correct manner of forming her thoughts, because I'm a-going\nto explain it to her.\" Here, standing on the hearth with his wet hat\nand shawls in his hand, himself a pile of wet, he turned to Mrs.\nSnagsby. \"Now, the first thing that I say to you, as a married woman\npossessing what you may call charms, you know--'Believe Me, if All\nThose Endearing,' and cetrer--you're well acquainted with the song,\nbecause it's in vain for you to tell me that you and good society are\nstrangers--charms--attractions, mind you, that ought to give you\nconfidence in yourself--is, that you've done it.\"\n\nMrs. Snagsby looked rather alarmed, relented a little and faltered,\nwhat did Mr. Bucket mean.\n\n\"What does Mr. Bucket mean?\" he repeated, and I saw by his face that\nall the time he talked he was listening for the discovery of the\nletter, to my own great agitation, for I knew then how important it\nmust be; \"I'll tell you what he means, ma'am. Go and see Othello\nacted. That's the tragedy for you.\"\n\nMrs. Snagsby consciously asked why.\n\n\"Why?\" said Mr. Bucket. \"Because you'll come to that if you don't\nlook out. Why, at the very moment while I speak, I know what your\nmind's not wholly free from respecting this young lady. But shall I\ntell you who this young lady is? Now, come, you're what I call an\nintellectual woman--with your soul too large for your body, if you\ncome to that, and chafing it--and you know me, and you recollect\nwhere you saw me last, and what was talked of in that circle. Don't\nyou? Yes! Very well. This young lady is that young lady.\"\n\nMrs. Snagsby appeared to understand the reference better than I did\nat the time.\n\n\"And Toughey--him as you call Jo--was mixed up in the same business,\nand no other; and the law-writer that you know of was mixed up in the\nsame business, and no other; and your husband, with no more knowledge\nof it than your great grandfather, was mixed up (by Mr. Tulkinghorn,\ndeceased, his best customer) in the same business, and no other; and\nthe whole bileing of people was mixed up in the same business, and no\nother. And yet a married woman, possessing your attractions, shuts\nher eyes (and sparklers too), and goes and runs her delicate-formed\nhead against a wall. Why, I am ashamed of you! (I expected Mr.\nWoodcourt might have got it by this time.)\"\n\nMrs. Snagsby shook her head and put her handkerchief to her eyes.\n\n\"Is that all?\" said Mr. Bucket excitedly. \"No. See what happens.\nAnother person mixed up in that business and no other, a person in a\nwretched state, comes here to-night and is seen a-speaking to your\nmaid-servant; and between her and your maid-servant there passes\na paper that I would give a hundred pound for, down. What do\nyou do? You hide and you watch 'em, and you pounce upon that\nmaid-servant--knowing what she's subject to and what a little thing\nwill bring 'em on--in that surprising manner and with that severity\nthat, by the Lord, she goes off and keeps off, when a life may be\nhanging upon that girl's words!\"\n\nHe so thoroughly meant what he said now that I involuntarily clasped\nmy hands and felt the room turning away from me. But it stopped. Mr.\nWoodcourt came in, put a paper into his hand, and went away again.\n\n\"Now, Mrs. Snagsby, the only amends you can make,\" said Mr. Bucket,\nrapidly glancing at it, \"is to let me speak a word to this young lady\nin private here. And if you know of any help that you can give to\nthat gentleman in the next kitchen there or can think of any one\nthing that's likelier than another to bring the girl round, do your\nswiftest and best!\" In an instant she was gone, and he had shut the\ndoor. \"Now my dear, you're steady and quite sure of yourself?\"\n\n\"Quite,\" said I.\n\n\"Whose writing is that?\"\n\nIt was my mother's. A pencil-writing, on a crushed and torn piece of\npaper, blotted with wet. Folded roughly like a letter, and directed\nto me at my guardian's.\n\n\"You know the hand,\" he said, \"and if you are firm enough to read it\nto me, do! But be particular to a word.\"\n\nIt had been written in portions, at different times. I read what\nfollows:\n\n\n   I came to the cottage with two objects. First, to see the\n   dear one, if I could, once more--but only to see her--not\n   to speak to her or let her know that I was near. The other\n   object, to elude pursuit and to be lost. Do not blame the\n   mother for her share. The assistance that she rendered me,\n   she rendered on my strongest assurance that it was for the\n   dear one's good. You remember her dead child. The men's\n   consent I bought, but her help was freely given.\n\n\n\"'I came.' That was written,\" said my companion, \"when she rested\nthere. It bears out what I made of it. I was right.\"\n\nThe next was written at another time:\n\n\n   I have wandered a long distance, and for many hours, and\n   I know that I must soon die. These streets! I have no\n   purpose but to die. When I left, I had a worse, but I am\n   saved from adding that guilt to the rest. Cold, wet, and\n   fatigue are sufficient causes for my being found dead, but\n   I shall die of others, though I suffer from these. It was\n   right that all that had sustained me should give way at\n   once and that I should die of terror and my conscience.\n\n\n\"Take courage,\" said Mr. Bucket. \"There's only a few words more.\"\n\nThose, too, were written at another time. To all appearance, almost\nin the dark:\n\n\n   I have done all I could do to be lost. I shall be soon\n   forgotten so, and shall disgrace him least. I have nothing\n   about me by which I can be recognized. This paper I part\n   with now. The place where I shall lie down, if I can get\n   so far, has been often in my mind. Farewell. Forgive.\n\n\nMr. Bucket, supporting me with his arm, lowered me gently into my\nchair. \"Cheer up! Don't think me hard with you, my dear, but as soon\nas ever you feel equal to it, get your shoes on and be ready.\"\n\nI did as he required, but I was left there a long time, praying for\nmy unhappy mother. They were all occupied with the poor girl, and I\nheard Mr. Woodcourt directing them and speaking to her often. At\nlength he came in with Mr. Bucket and said that as it was important\nto address her gently, he thought it best that I should ask her for\nwhatever information we desired to obtain. There was no doubt that\nshe could now reply to questions if she were soothed and not alarmed.\nThe questions, Mr. Bucket said, were how she came by the letter, what\npassed between her and the person who gave her the letter, and where\nthe person went. Holding my mind as steadily as I could to these\npoints, I went into the next room with them. Mr. Woodcourt would have\nremained outside, but at my solicitation went in with us.\n\nThe poor girl was sitting on the floor where they had laid her down.\nThey stood around her, though at a little distance, that she might\nhave air. She was not pretty and looked weak and poor, but she had a\nplaintive and a good face, though it was still a little wild. I\nkneeled on the ground beside her and put her poor head upon my\nshoulder, whereupon she drew her arm round my neck and burst into\ntears.\n\n\"My poor girl,\" said I, laying my face against her forehead, for\nindeed I was crying too, and trembling, \"it seems cruel to trouble\nyou now, but more depends on our knowing something about this letter\nthan I could tell you in an hour.\"\n\nShe began piteously declaring that she didn't mean any harm, she\ndidn't mean any harm, Mrs. Snagsby!\n\n\"We are all sure of that,\" said I. \"But pray tell me how you got it.\"\n\n\"Yes, dear lady, I will, and tell you true. I'll tell true, indeed,\nMrs. Snagsby.\"\n\n\"I am sure of that,\" said I. \"And how was it?\"\n\n\"I had been out on an errand, dear lady--long after it was\ndark--quite late; and when I came home, I found a common-looking\nperson, all wet and muddy, looking up at our house. When she saw me\ncoming in at the door, she called me back and said did I live here.\nAnd I said yes, and she said she knew only one or two places about\nhere, but had lost her way and couldn't find them. Oh, what shall I\ndo, what shall I do! They won't believe me! She didn't say any harm\nto me, and I didn't say any harm to her, indeed, Mrs. Snagsby!\"\n\nIt was necessary for her mistress to comfort her--which she did, I\nmust say, with a good deal of contrition--before she could be got\nbeyond this.\n\n\"She could not find those places,\" said I.\n\n\"No!\" cried the girl, shaking her head. \"No! Couldn't find them. And\nshe was so faint, and lame, and miserable, Oh so wretched, that if\nyou had seen her, Mr. Snagsby, you'd have given her half a crown, I\nknow!\"\n\n\"Well, Guster, my girl,\" said he, at first not knowing what to say.\n\"I hope I should.\"\n\n\"And yet she was so well spoken,\" said the girl, looking at me with\nwide open eyes, \"that it made a person's heart bleed. And so she said\nto me, did I know the way to the burying ground? And I asked her\nwhich burying ground. And she said, the poor burying ground. And so I\ntold her I had been a poor child myself, and it was according to\nparishes. But she said she meant a poor burying ground not very far\nfrom here, where there was an archway, and a step, and an iron gate.\"\n\nAs I watched her face and soothed her to go on, I saw that Mr. Bucket\nreceived this with a look which I could not separate from one of\nalarm.\n\n\"Oh, dear, dear!\" cried the girl, pressing her hair back with her\nhands. \"What shall I do, what shall I do! She meant the burying\nground where the man was buried that took the sleeping-stuff--that\nyou came home and told us of, Mr. Snagsby--that frightened me so,\nMrs. Snagsby. Oh, I am frightened again. Hold me!\"\n\n\"You are so much better now,\" sald I. \"Pray, pray tell me more.\"\n\n\"Yes I will, yes I will! But don't be angry with me, that's a dear\nlady, because I have been so ill.\"\n\nAngry with her, poor soul!\n\n\"There! Now I will, now I will. So she said, could I tell her how to\nfind it, and I said yes, and I told her; and she looked at me with\neyes like almost as if she was blind, and herself all waving back.\nAnd so she took out the letter, and showed it me, and said if she was\nto put that in the post-office, it would be rubbed out and not minded\nand never sent; and would I take it from her, and send it, and the\nmessenger would be paid at the house. And so I said yes, if it was no\nharm, and she said no--no harm. And so I took it from her, and she\nsaid she had nothing to give me, and I said I was poor myself and\nconsequently wanted nothing. And so she said God bless you, and\nwent.\"\n\n\"And did she go--\"\n\n\"Yes,\" cried the girl, anticipating the inquiry. \"Yes! She went the\nway I had shown her. Then I came in, and Mrs. Snagsby came behind me\nfrom somewhere and laid hold of me, and I was frightened.\"\n\nMr. Woodcourt took her kindly from me. Mr. Bucket wrapped me up, and\nimmediately we were in the street. Mr. Woodcourt hesitated, but I\nsaid, \"Don't leave me now!\" and Mr. Bucket added, \"You'll be better\nwith us, we may want you; don't lose time!\"\n\nI have the most confused impressions of that walk. I recollect that\nit was neither night nor day, that morning was dawning but the\nstreet-lamps were not yet put out, that the sleet was still falling\nand that all the ways were deep with it. I recollect a few chilled\npeople passing in the streets. I recollect the wet house-tops, the\nclogged and bursting gutters and water-spouts, the mounds of\nblackened ice and snow over which we passed, the narrowness of the\ncourts by which we went. At the same time I remember that the poor\ngirl seemed to be yet telling her story audibly and plainly in my\nhearing, that I could feel her resting on my arm, that the stained\nhouse-fronts put on human shapes and looked at me, that great\nwater-gates seemed to be opening and closing in my head or in the\nair, and that the unreal things were more substantial than the real.\n\nAt last we stood under a dark and miserable covered way, where one\nlamp was burning over an iron gate and where the morning faintly\nstruggled in. The gate was closed. Beyond it was a burial ground--a\ndreadful spot in which the night was very slowly stirring, but where\nI could dimly see heaps of dishonoured graves and stones, hemmed in\nby filthy houses with a few dull lights in their windows and on whose\nwalls a thick humidity broke out like a disease. On the step at the\ngate, drenched in the fearful wet of such a place, which oozed and\nsplashed down everywhere, I saw, with a cry of pity and horror, a\nwoman lying--Jenny, the mother of the dead child.\n\nI ran forward, but they stopped me, and Mr. Woodcourt entreated me\nwith the greatest earnestness, even with tears, before I went up to\nthe figure to listen for an instant to what Mr. Bucket said. I did\nso, as I thought. I did so, as I am sure.\n\n\"Miss Summerson, you'll understand me, if you think a moment. They\nchanged clothes at the cottage.\"\n\nThey changed clothes at the cottage. I could repeat the words in my\nmind, and I knew what they meant of themselves, but I attached no\nmeaning to them in any other connexion.\n\n\"And one returned,\" said Mr. Bucket, \"and one went on. And the one\nthat went on only went on a certain way agreed upon to deceive and\nthen turned across country and went home. Think a moment!\"\n\nI could repeat this in my mind too, but I had not the least idea what\nit meant. I saw before me, lying on the step, the mother of the dead\nchild. She lay there with one arm creeping round a bar of the iron\ngate and seeming to embrace it. She lay there, who had so lately\nspoken to my mother. She lay there, a distressed, unsheltered,\nsenseless creature. She who had brought my mother's letter, who could\ngive me the only clue to where my mother was; she, who was to guide\nus to rescue and save her whom we had sought so far, who had come to\nthis condition by some means connected with my mother that I could\nnot follow, and might be passing beyond our reach and help at that\nmoment; she lay there, and they stopped me! I saw but did not\ncomprehend the solemn and compassionate look in Mr. Woodcourt's face.\nI saw but did not comprehend his touching the other on the breast to\nkeep him back. I saw him stand uncovered in the bitter air, with a\nreverence for something. But my understanding for all this was gone.\n\nI even heard it said between them, \"Shall she go?\"\n\n\"She had better go. Her hands should be the first to touch her. They\nhave a higher right than ours.\"\n\nI passed on to the gate and stooped down. I lifted the heavy head,\nput the long dank hair aside, and turned the face. And it was my\nmother, cold and dead.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LX\n\nPerspective\n\n\nI proceed to other passages of my narrative. From the goodness of all\nabout me I derived such consolation as I can never think of unmoved.\nI have already said so much of myself, and so much still remains,\nthat I will not dwell upon my sorrow. I had an illness, but it was\nnot a long one; and I would avoid even this mention of it if I could\nquite keep down the recollection of their sympathy.\n\nI proceed to other passages of my narrative.\n\nDuring the time of my illness, we were still in London, where Mrs.\nWoodcourt had come, on my guardian's invitation, to stay with us.\nWhen my guardian thought me well and cheerful enough to talk with him\nin our old way--though I could have done that sooner if he would have\nbelieved me--I resumed my work and my chair beside his. He had\nappointed the time himself, and we were alone.\n\n\"Dame Trot,\" said he, receiving me with a kiss, \"welcome to the\ngrowlery again, my dear. I have a scheme to develop, little woman. I\npropose to remain here, perhaps for six months, perhaps for a longer\ntime--as it may be. Quite to settle here for a while, in short.\"\n\n\"And in the meanwhile leave Bleak House?\" said I.\n\n\"Aye, my dear? Bleak House,\" he returned, \"must learn to take care of\nitself.\"\n\nI thought his tone sounded sorrowful, but looking at him, I saw his\nkind face lighted up by its pleasantest smile.\n\n\"Bleak House,\" he repeated--and his tone did NOT sound sorrowful, I\nfound--\"must learn to take care of itself. It is a long way from Ada,\nmy dear, and Ada stands much in need of you.\"\n\n\"It's like you, guardian,\" said I, \"to have been taking that into\nconsideration for a happy surprise to both of us.\"\n\n\"Not so disinterested either, my dear, if you mean to extol me for\nthat virtue, since if you were generally on the road, you could be\nseldom with me. And besides, I wish to hear as much and as often of\nAda as I can in this condition of estrangement from poor Rick. Not of\nher alone, but of him too, poor fellow.\"\n\n\"Have you seen Mr. Woodcourt, this morning, guardian?\"\n\n\"I see Mr. Woodcourt every morning, Dame Durden.\"\n\n\"Does he still say the same of Richard?\"\n\n\"Just the same. He knows of no direct bodily illness that he has; on\nthe contrary, he believes that he has none. Yet he is not easy about\nhim; who CAN be?\"\n\nMy dear girl had been to see us lately every day, some times twice in\na day. But we had foreseen, all along, that this would only last\nuntil I was quite myself. We knew full well that her fervent heart\nwas as full of affection and gratitude towards her cousin John as it\nhad ever been, and we acquitted Richard of laying any injunctions\nupon her to stay away; but we knew on the other hand that she felt it\na part of her duty to him to be sparing of her visits at our house.\nMy guardian's delicacy had soon perceived this and had tried to\nconvey to her that he thought she was right.\n\n\"Dear, unfortunate, mistaken Richard,\" said I. \"When will he awake\nfrom his delusion!\"\n\n\"He is not in the way to do so now, my dear,\" replied my guardian.\n\"The more he suffers, the more averse he will be to me, having made\nme the principal representative of the great occasion of his\nsuffering.\"\n\nI could not help adding, \"So unreasonably!\"\n\n\"Ah, Dame Trot, Dame Trot,\" returned my guardian, \"what shall we find\nreasonable in Jarndyce and Jarndyce! Unreason and injustice at the\ntop, unreason and injustice at the heart and at the bottom, unreason\nand injustice from beginning to end--if it ever has an end--how\nshould poor Rick, always hovering near it, pluck reason out of it? He\nno more gathers grapes from thorns or figs from thistles than older\nmen did in old times.\"\n\nHis gentleness and consideration for Richard whenever we spoke of him\ntouched me so that I was always silent on this subject very soon.\n\n\"I suppose the Lord Chancellor, and the Vice Chancellors, and the\nwhole Chancery battery of great guns would be infinitely astonished\nby such unreason and injustice in one of their suitors,\" pursued my\nguardian. \"When those learned gentlemen begin to raise moss-roses\nfrom the powder they sow in their wigs, I shall begin to be\nastonished too!\"\n\nHe checked himself in glancing towards the window to look where the\nwind was and leaned on the back of my chair instead.\n\n\"Well, well, little woman! To go on, my dear. This rock we must leave\nto time, chance, and hopeful circumstance. We must not shipwreck Ada\nupon it. She cannot afford, and he cannot afford, the remotest chance\nof another separation from a friend. Therefore I have particularly\nbegged of Woodcourt, and I now particularly beg of you, my dear, not\nto move this subject with Rick. Let it rest. Next week, next month,\nnext year, sooner or later, he will see me with clearer eyes. I can\nwait.\"\n\nBut I had already discussed it with him, I confessed; and so, I\nthought, had Mr. Woodcourt.\n\n\"So he tells me,\" returned my guardian. \"Very good. He has made his\nprotest, and Dame Durden has made hers, and there is nothing more to\nbe said about it. Now I come to Mrs. Woodcourt. How do you like her,\nmy dear?\"\n\nIn answer to this question, which was oddly abrupt, I said I liked\nher very much and thought she was more agreeable than she used to be.\n\n\"I think so too,\" said my guardian. \"Less pedigree? Not so much of\nMorgan ap--what's his name?\"\n\nThat was what I meant, I acknowledged, though he was a very harmless\nperson, even when we had had more of him.\n\n\"Still, upon the whole, he is as well in his native mountains,\" said\nmy guardian. \"I agree with you. Then, little woman, can I do better\nfor a time than retain Mrs. Woodcourt here?\"\n\nNo. And yet--\n\nMy guardian looked at me, waiting for what I had to say.\n\nI had nothing to say. At least I had nothing in my mind that I could\nsay. I had an undefined impression that it might have been better if\nwe had had some other inmate, but I could hardly have explained why\neven to myself. Or, if to myself, certainly not to anybody else.\n\n\"You see,\" said my guardian, \"our neighbourhood is in Woodcourt's\nway, and he can come here to see her as often as he likes, which is\nagreeable to them both; and she is familiar to us and fond of you.\"\n\nYes. That was undeniable. I had nothing to say against it. I could\nnot have suggested a better arrangement, but I was not quite easy in\nmy mind. Esther, Esther, why not? Esther, think!\n\n\"It is a very good plan indeed, dear guardian, and we could not do\nbetter.\"\n\n\"Sure, little woman?\"\n\nQuite sure. I had had a moment's time to think, since I had urged\nthat duty on myself, and I was quite sure.\n\n\"Good,\" said my guardian. \"It shall be done. Carried unanimously.\"\n\n\"Carried unanimously,\" I repeated, going on with my work.\n\nIt was a cover for his book-table that I happened to be ornamenting.\nIt had been laid by on the night preceding my sad journey and never\nresumed. I showed it to him now, and he admired it highly. After I\nhad explained the pattern to him and all the great effects that were\nto come out by and by, I thought I would go back to our last theme.\n\n\"You said, dear guardian, when we spoke of Mr. Woodcourt before Ada\nleft us, that you thought he would give a long trial to another\ncountry. Have you been advising him since?\"\n\n\"Yes, little woman, pretty often.\"\n\n\"Has he decided to do so?\"\n\n\"I rather think not.\"\n\n\"Some other prospect has opened to him, perhaps?\" said I.\n\n\"Why--yes--perhaps,\" returned my guardian, beginning his answer in a\nvery deliberate manner. \"About half a year hence or so, there is a\nmedical attendant for the poor to be appointed at a certain place in\nYorkshire. It is a thriving place, pleasantly situated--streams and\nstreets, town and country, mill and moor--and seems to present an\nopening for such a man. I mean a man whose hopes and aims may\nsometimes lie (as most men's sometimes do, I dare say) above the\nordinary level, but to whom the ordinary level will be high enough\nafter all if it should prove to be a way of usefulness and good\nservice leading to no other. All generous spirits are ambitious, I\nsuppose, but the ambition that calmly trusts itself to such a road,\ninstead of spasmodically trying to fly over it, is of the kind I care\nfor. It is Woodcourt's kind.\"\n\n\"And will he get this appointment?\" I asked.\n\n\"Why, little woman,\" returned my guardian, smiling, \"not being an\noracle, I cannot confidently say, but I think so. His reputation\nstands very high; there were people from that part of the country in\nthe shipwreck; and strange to say, I believe the best man has the\nbest chance. You must not suppose it to be a fine endowment. It is a\nvery, very commonplace affair, my dear, an appointment to a great\namount of work and a small amount of pay; but better things will\ngather about it, it may be fairly hoped.\"\n\n\"The poor of that place will have reason to bless the choice if it\nfalls on Mr. Woodcourt, guardian.\"\n\n\"You are right, little woman; that I am sure they will.\"\n\nWe said no more about it, nor did he say a word about the future of\nBleak House. But it was the first time I had taken my seat at his\nside in my mourning dress, and that accounted for it, I considered.\n\nI now began to visit my dear girl every day in the dull dark corner\nwhere she lived. The morning was my usual time, but whenever I found\nI had an hour or so to spare, I put on my bonnet and bustled off to\nChancery Lane. They were both so glad to see me at all hours, and\nused to brighten up so when they heard me opening the door and coming\nin (being quite at home, I never knocked), that I had no fear of\nbecoming troublesome just yet.\n\nOn these occasions I frequently found Richard absent. At other times\nhe would be writing or reading papers in the cause at that table of\nhis, so covered with papers, which was never disturbed. Sometimes I\nwould come upon him lingering at the door of Mr. Vholes's office.\nSometimes I would meet him in the neighbourhood lounging about and\nbiting his nails. I often met him wandering in Lincoln's Inn, near\nthe place where I had first seen him, oh how different, how\ndifferent!\n\nThat the money Ada brought him was melting away with the candles I\nused to see burning after dark in Mr. Vholes's office I knew very\nwell. It was not a large amount in the beginning, he had married in\ndebt, and I could not fail to understand, by this time, what was\nmeant by Mr. Vholes's shoulder being at the wheel--as I still heard\nit was. My dear made the best of housekeepers and tried hard to save,\nbut I knew that they were getting poorer and poorer every day.\n\nShe shone in the miserable corner like a beautiful star. She adorned\nand graced it so that it became another place. Paler than she had\nbeen at home, and a little quieter than I had thought natural when\nshe was yet so cheerful and hopeful, her face was so unshadowed that\nI half believed she was blinded by her love for Richard to his\nruinous career.\n\nI went one day to dine with them while I was under this impression.\nAs I turned into Symond's Inn, I met little Miss Flite coming out.\nShe had been to make a stately call upon the wards in Jarndyce, as\nshe still called them, and had derived the highest gratification from\nthat ceremony. Ada had already told me that she called every Monday\nat five o'clock, with one little extra white bow in her bonnet, which\nnever appeared there at any other time, and with her largest reticule\nof documents on her arm.\n\n\"My dear!\" she began. \"So delighted! How do you do! So glad to see\nyou. And you are going to visit our interesting Jarndyce wards? TO be\nsure! Our beauty is at home, my dear, and will be charmed to see\nyou.\"\n\n\"Then Richard is not come in yet?\" said I. \"I am glad of that, for I\nwas afraid of being a little late.\"\n\n\"No, he is not come in,\" returned Miss Flite. \"He has had a long day\nin court. I left him there with Vholes. You don't like Vholes, I\nhope? DON'T like Vholes. Dan-gerous man!\"\n\n\"I am afraid you see Richard oftener than ever now,\" said I.\n\n\"My dearest,\" returned Miss Flite, \"daily and hourly. You know what I\ntold you of the attraction on the Chancellor's table? My dear, next\nto myself he is the most constant suitor in court. He begins quite to\namuse our little party. Ve-ry friendly little party, are we not?\"\n\nIt was miserable to hear this from her poor mad lips, though it was\nno surprise.\n\n\"In short, my valued friend,\" pursued Miss Flite, advancing her lips\nto my ear with an air of equal patronage and mystery, \"I must tell\nyou a secret. I have made him my executor. Nominated, constituted,\nand appointed him. In my will. Ye-es.\"\n\n\"Indeed?\" said I.\n\n\"Ye-es,\" repeated Miss Flite in her most genteel accents, \"my\nexecutor, administrator, and assign. (Our Chancery phrases, my love.)\nI have reflected that if I should wear out, he will be able to watch\nthat judgment. Being so very regular in his attendance.\"\n\nIt made me sigh to think of him.\n\n\"I did at one time mean,\" said Miss Flite, echoing the sigh, \"to\nnominate, constitute, and appoint poor Gridley. Also very regular, my\ncharming girl. I assure you, most exemplary! But he wore out, poor\nman, so I have appointed his successor. Don't mention it. This is in\nconfidence.\"\n\nShe carefully opened her reticule a little way and showed me a folded\npiece of paper inside as the appointment of which she spoke.\n\n\"Another secret, my dear. I have added to my collection of birds.\"\n\n\"Really, Miss Flite?\" said I, knowing how it pleased her to have her\nconfidence received with an appearance of interest.\n\nShe nodded several times, and her face became overcast and gloomy.\n\"Two more. I call them the Wards in Jarndyce. They are caged up with\nall the others. With Hope, Joy, Youth, Peace, Rest, Life, Dust,\nAshes, Waste, Want, Ruin, Despair, Madness, Death, Cunning, Folly,\nWords, Wigs, Rags, Sheepskin, Plunder, Precedent, Jargon, Gammon, and\nSpinach!\"\n\nThe poor soul kissed me with the most troubled look I had ever seen\nin her and went her way. Her manner of running over the names of her\nbirds, as if she were afraid of hearing them even from her own lips,\nquite chilled me.\n\nThis was not a cheering preparation for my visit, and I could have\ndispensed with the company of Mr. Vholes, when Richard (who arrived\nwithin a minute or two after me) brought him to share our dinner.\nAlthough it was a very plain one, Ada and Richard were for some\nminutes both out of the room together helping to get ready what we\nwere to eat and drink. Mr. Vholes took that opportunity of holding a\nlittle conversation in a low voice with me. He came to the window\nwhere I was sitting and began upon Symond's Inn.\n\n\"A dull place, Miss Summerson, for a life that is not an official\none,\" said Mr. Vholes, smearing the glass with his black glove to\nmake it clearer for me.\n\n\"There is not much to see here,\" said I.\n\n\"Nor to hear, miss,\" returned Mr. Vholes. \"A little music does\noccasionally stray in, but we are not musical in the law and soon\neject it. I hope Mr. Jarndyce is as well as his friends could wish\nhim?\"\n\nI thanked Mr. Vholes and said he was quite well.\n\n\"I have not the pleasure to be admitted among the number of his\nfriends myself,\" said Mr. Vholes, \"and I am aware that the gentlemen\nof our profession are sometimes regarded in such quarters with an\nunfavourable eye. Our plain course, however, under good report and\nevil report, and all kinds of prejudice (we are the victims of\nprejudice), is to have everything openly carried on. How do you find\nMr. C. looking, Miss Summerson?\"\n\n\"He looks very ill. Dreadfully anxious.\"\n\n\"Just so,\" said Mr. Vholes.\n\nHe stood behind me with his long black figure reaching nearly to the\nceiling of those low rooms, feeling the pimples on his face as if\nthey were ornaments and speaking inwardly and evenly as though there\nwere not a human passion or emotion in his nature.\n\n\"Mr. Woodcourt is in attendance upon Mr. C., I believe?\" he resumed.\n\n\"Mr. Woodcourt is his disinterested friend,\" I answered.\n\n\"But I mean in professional attendance, medical attendance.\"\n\n\"That can do little for an unhappy mind,\" said I.\n\n\"Just so,\" said Mr. Vholes.\n\nSo slow, so eager, so bloodless and gaunt, I felt as if Richard were\nwasting away beneath the eyes of this adviser and there were\nsomething of the vampire in him.\n\n\"Miss Summerson,\" said Mr. Vholes, very slowly rubbing his gloved\nhands, as if, to his cold sense of touch, they were much the same in\nblack kid or out of it, \"this was an ill-advised marriage of Mr.\nC.'s.\"\n\nI begged he would excuse me from discussing it. They had been engaged\nwhen they were both very young, I told him (a little indignantly) and\nwhen the prospect before them was much fairer and brighter. When\nRichard had not yielded himself to the unhappy influence which now\ndarkened his life.\n\n\"Just so,\" assented Mr. Vholes again. \"Still, with a view to\neverything being openly carried on, I will, with your permission,\nMiss Summerson, observe to you that I consider this a very\nill-advised marriage indeed. I owe the opinion not only to Mr. C.'s\nconnexions, against whom I should naturally wish to protect myself,\nbut also to my own reputation--dear to myself as a professional man\naiming to keep respectable; dear to my three girls at home, for whom\nI am striving to realize some little independence; dear, I will even\nsay, to my aged father, whom it is my privilege to support.\"\n\n\"It would become a very different marriage, a much happier and better\nmarriage, another marriage altogether, Mr. Vholes,\" said I, \"if\nRichard were persuaded to turn his back on the fatal pursuit in which\nyou are engaged with him.\"\n\nMr. Vholes, with a noiseless cough--or rather gasp--into one of his\nblack gloves, inclined his head as if he did not wholly dispute even\nthat.\n\n\"Miss Summerson,\" he said, \"it may be so; and I freely admit that the\nyoung lady who has taken Mr. C.'s name upon herself in so ill-advised\na manner--you will I am sure not quarrel with me for throwing out\nthat remark again, as a duty I owe to Mr. C.'s connexions--is a\nhighly genteel young lady. Business has prevented me from mixing much\nwith general society in any but a professional character; still I\ntrust I am competent to perceive that she is a highly genteel young\nlady. As to beauty, I am not a judge of that myself, and I never did\ngive much attention to it from a boy, but I dare say the young lady\nis equally eligible in that point of view. She is considered so (I\nhave heard) among the clerks in the Inn, and it is a point more in\ntheir way than in mine. In reference to Mr. C.'s pursuit of his\ninterests--\"\n\n\"Oh! His interests, Mr. Vholes!\"\n\n\"Pardon me,\" returned Mr. Vholes, going on in exactly the same inward\nand dispassionate manner. \"Mr. C. takes certain interests under\ncertain wills disputed in the suit. It is a term we use. In reference\nto Mr. C,'s pursuit of his interests, I mentioned to you, Miss\nSummerson, the first time I had the pleasure of seeing you, in my\ndesire that everything should be openly carried on--I used those\nwords, for I happened afterwards to note them in my diary, which is\nproducible at any time--I mentioned to you that Mr. C. had laid down\nthe principle of watching his own interests, and that when a client\nof mine laid down a principle which was not of an immoral (that is to\nsay, unlawful) nature, it devolved upon me to carry it out. I HAVE\ncarried it out; I do carry it out. But I will not smooth things over\nto any connexion of Mr. C.'s on any account. As open as I was to Mr.\nJarndyce, I am to you. I regard it in the light of a professional\nduty to be so, though it can be charged to no one. I openly say,\nunpalatable as it may be, that I consider Mr. C.'s affairs in a very\nbad way, that I consider Mr. C. himself in a very bad way, and that I\nregard this as an exceedingly ill-advised marriage. Am I here, sir?\nYes, I thank you; I am here, Mr. C., and enjoying the pleasure of\nsome agreeable conversation with Miss Summerson, for which I have to\nthank you very much, sir!\"\n\nHe broke off thus in answer to Richard, who addressed him as he came\ninto the room. By this time I too well understood Mr. Vholes's\nscrupulous way of saving himself and his respectability not to feel\nthat our worst fears did but keep pace with his client's progress.\n\nWe sat down to dinner, and I had an opportunity of observing Richard,\nanxiously. I was not disturbed by Mr. Vholes (who took off his gloves\nto dine), though he sat opposite to me at the small table, for I\ndoubt if, looking up at all, he once removed his eyes from his host's\nface. I found Richard thin and languid, slovenly in his dress,\nabstracted in his manner, forcing his spirits now and then, and at\nother intervals relapsing into a dull thoughtfulness. About his large\nbright eyes that used to be so merry there was a wanness and a\nrestlessness that changed them altogether. I cannot use the\nexpression that he looked old. There is a ruin of youth which is not\nlike age, and into such a ruin Richard's youth and youthful beauty\nhad all fallen away.\n\nHe ate little and seemed indifferent what it was, showed himself to\nbe much more impatient than he used to be, and was quick even with\nAda. I thought at first that his old light-hearted manner was all\ngone, but it shone out of him sometimes as I had occasionally known\nlittle momentary glimpses of my own old face to look out upon me from\nthe glass. His laugh had not quite left him either, but it was like\nthe echo of a joyful sound, and that is always sorrowful.\n\nYet he was as glad as ever, in his old affectionate way, to have me\nthere, and we talked of the old times pleasantly. These did not\nappear to be interesting to Mr. Vholes, though he occasionally made a\ngasp which I believe was his smile. He rose shortly after dinner and\nsaid that with the permission of the ladies he would retire to his\noffice.\n\n\"Always devoted to business, Vholes!\" cried Richard.\n\n\"Yes, Mr. C.,\" he returned, \"the interests of clients are never to be\nneglected, sir. They are paramount in the thoughts of a professional\nman like myself, who wishes to preserve a good name among his\nfellow-practitioners and society at large. My denying myself the\npleasure of the present agreeable conversation may not be wholly\nirrespective of your own interests, Mr. C.\"\n\nRichard expressed himself quite sure of that and lighted Mr. Vholes\nout. On his return he told us, more than once, that Vholes was a good\nfellow, a safe fellow, a man who did what he pretended to do, a very\ngood fellow indeed! He was so defiant about it that it struck me he\nhad begun to doubt Mr. Vholes.\n\nThen he threw himself on the sofa, tired out; and Ada and I put\nthings to rights, for they had no other servant than the woman who\nattended to the chambers. My dear girl had a cottage piano there and\nquietly sat down to sing some of Richard's favourites, the lamp being\nfirst removed into the next room, as he complained of its hurting his\neyes.\n\nI sat between them, at my dear girl's side, and felt very melancholy\nlistening to her sweet voice. I think Richard did too; I think he\ndarkened the room for that reason. She had been singing some time,\nrising between whiles to bend over him and speak to him, when Mr.\nWoodcourt came in. Then he sat down by Richard and half playfully,\nhalf earnestly, quite naturally and easily, found out how he felt and\nwhere he had been all day. Presently he proposed to accompany him in\na short walk on one of the bridges, as it was a moonlight airy night;\nand Richard readily consenting, they went out together.\n\nThey left my dear girl still sitting at the piano and me still\nsitting beside her. When they were gone out, I drew my arm round her\nwaist. She put her left hand in mine (I was sitting on that side),\nbut kept her right upon the keys, going over and over them without\nstriking any note.\n\n\"Esther, my dearest,\" she said, breaking silence, \"Richard is never\nso well and I am never so easy about him as when he is with Allan\nWoodcourt. We have to thank you for that.\"\n\nI pointed out to my darling how this could scarcely be, because Mr.\nWoodcourt had come to her cousin John's house and had known us all\nthere, and because he had always liked Richard, and Richard had\nalways liked him, and--and so forth.\n\n\"All true,\" said Ada, \"but that he is such a devoted friend to us we\nowe to you.\"\n\nI thought it best to let my dear girl have her way and to say no more\nabout it. So I said as much. I said it lightly, because I felt her\ntrembling.\n\n\"Esther, my dearest, I want to be a good wife, a very, very good wife\nindeed. You shall teach me.\"\n\nI teach! I said no more, for I noticed the hand that was fluttering\nover the keys, and I knew that it was not I who ought to speak, that\nit was she who had something to say to me.\n\n\"When I married Richard I was not insensible to what was before him.\nI had been perfectly happy for a long time with you, and I had never\nknown any trouble or anxiety, so loved and cared for, but I\nunderstood the danger he was in, dear Esther.\"\n\n\"I know, I know, my darling.\"\n\n\"When we were married I had some little hope that I might be able to\nconvince him of his mistake, that he might come to regard it in a new\nway as my husband and not pursue it all the more desperately for my\nsake--as he does. But if I had not had that hope, I would have\nmarried him just the same, Esther. Just the same!\"\n\nIn the momentary firmness of the hand that was never still--a\nfirmness inspired by the utterance of these last words, and dying\naway with them--I saw the confirmation of her earnest tones.\n\n\"You are not to think, my dearest Esther, that I fail to see what you\nsee and fear what you fear. No one can understand him better than I\ndo. The greatest wisdom that ever lived in the world could scarcely\nknow Richard better than my love does.\"\n\nShe spoke so modestly and softly and her trembling hand expressed\nsuch agitation as it moved to and fro upon the silent notes! My dear,\ndear girl!\n\n\"I see him at his worst every day. I watch him in his sleep. I know\nevery change of his face. But when I married Richard I was quite\ndetermined, Esther, if heaven would help me, never to show him that I\ngrieved for what he did and so to make him more unhappy. I want him,\nwhen he comes home, to find no trouble in my face. I want him, when\nhe looks at me, to see what he loved in me. I married him to do this,\nand this supports me.\"\n\nI felt her trembling more. I waited for what was yet to come, and I\nnow thought I began to know what it was.\n\n\"And something else supports me, Esther.\"\n\nShe stopped a minute. Stopped speaking only; her hand was still in\nmotion.\n\n\"I look forward a little while, and I don't know what great aid may\ncome to me. When Richard turns his eyes upon me then, there may be\nsomething lying on my breast more eloquent than I have been, with\ngreater power than mine to show him his true course and win him\nback.\"\n\nHer hand stopped now. She clasped me in her arms, and I clasped her\nin mine.\n\n\"If that little creature should fail too, Esther, I still look\nforward. I look forward a long while, through years and years, and\nthink that then, when I am growing old, or when I am dead perhaps, a\nbeautiful woman, his daughter, happily married, may be proud of him\nand a blessing to him. Or that a generous brave man, as handsome as\nhe used to be, as hopeful, and far more happy, may walk in the\nsunshine with him, honouring his grey head and saying to himself, 'I\nthank God this is my father! Ruined by a fatal inheritance, and\nrestored through me!'\"\n\nOh, my sweet girl, what a heart was that which beat so fast against\nme!\n\n\"These hopes uphold me, my dear Esther, and I know they will. Though\nsometimes even they depart from me before a dread that arises when I\nlook at Richard.\"\n\nI tried to cheer my darling, and asked her what it was. Sobbing and\nweeping, she replied, \"That he may not live to see his child.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXI\n\nA Discovery\n\n\nThe days when I frequented that miserable corner which my dear girl\nbrightened can never fade in my remembrance. I never see it, and I\nnever wish to see it now; I have been there only once since, but in\nmy memory there is a mournful glory shining on the place which will\nshine for ever.\n\nNot a day passed without my going there, of course. At first I found\nMr. Skimpole there, on two or three occasions, idly playing the piano\nand talking in his usual vivacious strain. Now, besides my very much\nmistrusting the probability of his being there without making Richard\npoorer, I felt as if there were something in his careless gaiety too\ninconsistent with what I knew of the depths of Ada's life. I clearly\nperceived, too, that Ada shared my feelings. I therefore resolved,\nafter much thinking of it, to make a private visit to Mr. Skimpole\nand try delicately to explain myself. My dear girl was the great\nconsideration that made me bold.\n\nI set off one morning, accompanied by Charley, for Somers Town. As I\napproached the house, I was strongly inclined to turn back, for I\nfelt what a desperate attempt it was to make an impression on Mr.\nSkimpole and how extremely likely it was that he would signally\ndefeat me. However, I thought that being there, I would go through\nwith it. I knocked with a trembling hand at Mr. Skimpole's\ndoor--literally with a hand, for the knocker was gone--and after a\nlong parley gained admission from an Irishwoman, who was in the area\nwhen I knocked, breaking up the lid of a water-butt with a poker to\nlight the fire with.\n\nMr. Skimpole, lying on the sofa in his room, playing the flute a\nlittle, was enchanted to see me. Now, who should receive me, he\nasked. Who would I prefer for mistress of the ceremonies? Would I\nhave his Comedy daughter, his Beauty daughter, or his Sentiment\ndaughter? Or would I have all the daughters at once in a perfect\nnosegay?\n\nI replied, half defeated already, that I wished to speak to himself\nonly if he would give me leave.\n\n\"My dear Miss Summerson, most joyfully! Of course,\" he said, bringing\nhis chair nearer mine and breaking into his fascinating smile, \"of\ncourse it's not business. Then it's pleasure!\"\n\nI said it certainly was not business that I came upon, but it was not\nquite a pleasant matter.\n\n\"Then, my dear Miss Summerson,\" said he with the frankest gaiety,\n\"don't allude to it. Why should you allude to anything that is NOT a\npleasant matter? I never do. And you are a much pleasanter creature,\nin every point of view, than I. You are perfectly pleasant; I am\nimperfectly pleasant; then, if I never allude to an unpleasant\nmatter, how much less should you! So that's disposed of, and we will\ntalk of something else.\"\n\nAlthough I was embarrassed, I took courage to intimate that I still\nwished to pursue the subject.\n\n\"I should think it a mistake,\" said Mr. Skimpole with his airy laugh,\n\"if I thought Miss Summerson capable of making one. But I don't!\"\n\n\"Mr. Skimpole,\" said I, raising my eyes to his, \"I have so often\nheard you say that you are unacquainted with the common affairs of\nlife--\"\n\n\"Meaning our three banking-house friends, L, S, and who's the junior\npartner? D?\" said Mr. Skimpole, brightly. \"Not an idea of them!\"\n\n\"--That perhaps,\" I went on, \"you will excuse my boldness on that\naccount. I think you ought most seriously to know that Richard is\npoorer than he was.\"\n\n\"Dear me!\" said Mr. Skimpole. \"So am I, they tell me.\"\n\n\"And in very embarrassed circumstances.\"\n\n\"Parallel case, exactly!\" said Mr. Skimpole with a delighted\ncountenance.\n\n\"This at present naturally causes Ada much secret anxiety, and as I\nthink she is less anxious when no claims are made upon her by\nvisitors, and as Richard has one uneasiness always heavy on his mind,\nit has occurred to me to take the liberty of saying that--if you\nwould--not--\"\n\nI was coming to the point with great difficulty when he took me by\nboth hands and with a radiant face and in the liveliest way\nanticipated it.\n\n\"Not go there? Certainly not, my dear Miss Summerson, most assuredly\nnot. Why SHOULD I go there? When I go anywhere, I go for pleasure. I\ndon't go anywhere for pain, because I was made for pleasure. Pain\ncomes to ME when it wants me. Now, I have had very little pleasure at\nour dear Richard's lately, and your practical sagacity demonstrates\nwhy. Our young friends, losing the youthful poetry which was once so\ncaptivating in them, begin to think, 'This is a man who wants\npounds.' So I am; I always want pounds; not for myself, but because\ntradespeople always want them of me. Next, our young friends begin to\nthink, becoming mercenary, 'This is the man who HAD pounds, who\nborrowed them,' which I did. I always borrow pounds. So our young\nfriends, reduced to prose (which is much to be regretted), degenerate\nin their power of imparting pleasure to me. Why should I go to see\nthem, therefore? Absurd!\"\n\nThrough the beaming smile with which he regarded me as he reasoned\nthus, there now broke forth a look of disinterested benevolence quite\nastonishing.\n\n\"Besides,\" he said, pursuing his argument in his tone of\nlight-hearted conviction, \"if I don't go anywhere for pain--which\nwould be a perversion of the intention of my being, and a monstrous\nthing to do--why should I go anywhere to be the cause of pain? If I\nwent to see our young friends in their present ill-regulated state of\nmind, I should give them pain. The associations with me would be\ndisagreeable. They might say, 'This is the man who had pounds and who\ncan't pay pounds,' which I can't, of course; nothing could be more\nout of the question! Then kindness requires that I shouldn't go near\nthem--and I won't.\"\n\nHe finished by genially kissing my hand and thanking me. Nothing but\nMiss Summerson's fine tact, he said, would have found this out for\nhim.\n\nI was much disconcerted, but I reflected that if the main point were\ngained, it mattered little how strangely he perverted everything\nleading to it. I had determined to mention something else, however,\nand I thought I was not to be put off in that.\n\n\"Mr. Skimpole,\" said I, \"I must take the liberty of saying before I\nconclude my visit that I was much surprised to learn, on the best\nauthority, some little time ago, that you knew with whom that poor\nboy left Bleak House and that you accepted a present on that\noccasion. I have not mentioned it to my guardian, for I fear it would\nhurt him unnecessarily; but I may say to you that I was much\nsurprised.\"\n\n\"No? Really surprised, my dear Miss Summerson?\" he returned\ninquiringly, raising his pleasant eyebrows.\n\n\"Greatly surprised.\"\n\nHe thought about it for a little while with a highly agreeable and\nwhimsical expression of face, then quite gave it up and said in his\nmost engaging manner, \"You know what a child I am. Why surprised?\"\n\nI was reluctant to enter minutely into that question, but as he\nbegged I would, for he was really curious to know, I gave him to\nunderstand in the gentlest words I could use that his conduct seemed\nto involve a disregard of several moral obligations. He was much\namused and interested when he heard this and said, \"No, really?\" with\ningenuous simplicity.\n\n\"You know I don't intend to be responsible. I never could do it.\nResponsibility is a thing that has always been above me--or below\nme,\" said Mr. Skimpole. \"I don't even know which; but as I understand\nthe way in which my dear Miss Summerson (always remarkable for her\npractical good sense and clearness) puts this case, I should imagine\nit was chiefly a question of money, do you know?\"\n\nI incautiously gave a qualified assent to this.\n\n\"Ah! Then you see,\" said Mr. Skimpole, shaking his head, \"I am\nhopeless of understanding it.\"\n\nI suggested, as I rose to go, that it was not right to betray my\nguardian's confidence for a bribe.\n\n\"My dear Miss Summerson,\" he returned with a candid hilarity that was\nall his own, \"I can't be bribed.\"\n\n\"Not by Mr. Bucket?\" said I.\n\n\"No,\" said he. \"Not by anybody. I don't attach any value to money. I\ndon't care about it, I don't know about it, I don't want it, I don't\nkeep it--it goes away from me directly. How can I be bribed?\"\n\nI showed that I was of a different opinion, though I had not the\ncapacity for arguing the question.\n\n\"On the contrary,\" said Mr. Skimpole, \"I am exactly the man to be\nplaced in a superior position in such a case as that. I am above the\nrest of mankind in such a case as that. I can act with philosophy in\nsuch a case as that. I am not warped by prejudices, as an Italian\nbaby is by bandages. I am as free as the air. I feel myself as far\nabove suspicion as Caesar's wife.\"\n\nAnything to equal the lightness of his manner and the playful\nimpartiality with which he seemed to convince himself, as he tossed\nthe matter about like a ball of feathers, was surely never seen in\nanybody else!\n\n\"Observe the case, my dear Miss Summerson. Here is a boy received\ninto the house and put to bed in a state that I strongly object to.\nThe boy being in bed, a man arrives--like the house that Jack built.\nHere is the man who demands the boy who is received into the house\nand put to bed in a state that I strongly object to. Here is a\nbank-note produced by the man who demands the boy who is received\ninto the house and put to bed in a state that I strongly object to.\nHere is the Skimpole who accepts the bank-note produced by the man\nwho demands the boy who is received into the house and put to bed in\na state that I strongly object to. Those are the facts. Very well.\nShould the Skimpole have refused the note? WHY should the Skimpole\nhave refused the note? Skimpole protests to Bucket, 'What's this for?\nI don't understand it, it is of no use to me, take it away.' Bucket\nstill entreats Skimpole to accept it. Are there reasons why Skimpole,\nnot being warped by prejudices, should accept it? Yes. Skimpole\nperceives them. What are they? Skimpole reasons with himself, this is\na tamed lynx, an active police-officer, an intelligent man, a person\nof a peculiarly directed energy and great subtlety both of conception\nand execution, who discovers our friends and enemies for us when they\nrun away, recovers our property for us when we are robbed, avenges us\ncomfortably when we are murdered. This active police-officer and\nintelligent man has acquired, in the exercise of his art, a strong\nfaith in money; he finds it very useful to him, and he makes it very\nuseful to society. Shall I shake that faith in Bucket because I want\nit myself; shall I deliberately blunt one of Bucket's weapons; shall\nI positively paralyse Bucket in his next detective operation? And\nagain. If it is blameable in Skimpole to take the note, it is\nblameable in Bucket to offer the note--much more blameable in Bucket,\nbecause he is the knowing man. Now, Skimpole wishes to think well of\nBucket; Skimpole deems it essential, in its little place, to the\ngeneral cohesion of things, that he SHOULD think well of Bucket. The\nstate expressly asks him to trust to Bucket. And he does. And that's\nall he does!\"\n\nI had nothing to offer in reply to this exposition and therefore took\nmy leave. Mr. Skimpole, however, who was in excellent spirits, would\nnot hear of my returning home attended only by \"Little Coavinses,\"\nand accompanied me himself. He entertained me on the way with a\nvariety of delightful conversation and assured me, at parting, that\nhe should never forget the fine tact with which I had found that out\nfor him about our young friends.\n\nAs it so happened that I never saw Mr. Skimpole again, I may at once\nfinish what I know of his history. A coolness arose between him and\nmy guardian, based principally on the foregoing grounds and on his\nhaving heartlessly disregarded my guardian's entreaties (as we\nafterwards learned from Ada) in reference to Richard. His being\nheavily in my guardian's debt had nothing to do with their\nseparation. He died some five years afterwards and left a diary\nbehind him, with letters and other materials towards his life, which\nwas published and which showed him to have been the victim of a\ncombination on the part of mankind against an amiable child. It was\nconsidered very pleasant reading, but I never read more of it myself\nthan the sentence on which I chanced to light on opening the book. It\nwas this: \"Jarndyce, in common with most other men I have known, is\nthe incarnation of selfishness.\"\n\nAnd now I come to a part of my story touching myself very nearly\nindeed, and for which I was quite unprepared when the circumstance\noccurred. Whatever little lingerings may have now and then revived in\nmy mind associated with my poor old face had only revived as\nbelonging to a part of my life that was gone--gone like my infancy or\nmy childhood. I have suppressed none of my many weaknesses on that\nsubject, but have written them as faithfully as my memory has\nrecalled them. And I hope to do, and mean to do, the same down to the\nlast words of these pages, which I see now not so very far before me.\n\nThe months were gliding away, and my dear girl, sustained by the\nhopes she had confided in me, was the same beautiful star in the\nmiserable corner. Richard, more worn and haggard, haunted the court\nday after day, listlessly sat there the whole day long when he knew\nthere was no remote chance of the suit being mentioned, and became\none of the stock sights of the place. I wonder whether any of the\ngentlemen remembered him as he was when he first went there.\n\nSo completely was he absorbed in his fixed idea that he used to avow\nin his cheerful moments that he should never have breathed the fresh\nair now \"but for Woodcourt.\" It was only Mr. Woodcourt who could\noccasionally divert his attention for a few hours at a time and rouse\nhim, even when he sunk into a lethargy of mind and body that alarmed\nus greatly, and the returns of which became more frequent as the\nmonths went on. My dear girl was right in saying that he only pursued\nhis errors the more desperately for her sake. I have no doubt that\nhis desire to retrieve what he had lost was rendered the more intense\nby his grief for his young wife, and became like the madness of a\ngamester.\n\nI was there, as I have mentioned, at all hours. When I was there at\nnight, I generally went home with Charley in a coach; sometimes my\nguardian would meet me in the neighbourhood, and we would walk home\ntogether. One evening he had arranged to meet me at eight o'clock. I\ncould not leave, as I usually did, quite punctually at the time, for\nI was working for my dear girl and had a few stitches more to do to\nfinish what I was about; but it was within a few minutes of the hour\nwhen I bundled up my little work-basket, gave my darling my last kiss\nfor the night, and hurried downstairs. Mr. Woodcourt went with me, as\nit was dusk.\n\nWhen we came to the usual place of meeting--it was close by, and Mr.\nWoodcourt had often accompanied me before--my guardian was not there.\nWe waited half an hour, walking up and down, but there were no signs\nof him. We agreed that he was either prevented from coming or that he\nhad come and gone away, and Mr. Woodcourt proposed to walk home with\nme.\n\nIt was the first walk we had ever taken together, except that very\nshort one to the usual place of meeting. We spoke of Richard and Ada\nthe whole way. I did not thank him in words for what he had done--my\nappreciation of it had risen above all words then--but I hoped he\nmight not be without some understanding of what I felt so strongly.\n\nArriving at home and going upstairs, we found that my guardian was\nout and that Mrs. Woodcourt was out too. We were in the very same\nroom into which I had brought my blushing girl when her youthful\nlover, now her so altered husband, was the choice of her young heart,\nthe very same room from which my guardian and I had watched them\ngoing away through the sunlight in the fresh bloom of their hope and\npromise.\n\nWe were standing by the opened window looking down into the street\nwhen Mr. Woodcourt spoke to me. I learned in a moment that he loved\nme. I learned in a moment that my scarred face was all unchanged to\nhim. I learned in a moment that what I had thought was pity and\ncompassion was devoted, generous, faithful love. Oh, too late to know\nit now, too late, too late. That was the first ungrateful thought I\nhad. Too late.\n\n\"When I returned,\" he told me, \"when I came back, no richer than when\nI went away, and found you newly risen from a sick bed, yet so\ninspired by sweet consideration for others and so free from a selfish\nthought--\"\n\n\"Oh, Mr. Woodcourt, forbear, forbear!\" I entreated him. \"I do not\ndeserve your high praise. I had many selfish thoughts at that time,\nmany!\"\n\n\"Heaven knows, beloved of my life,\" said he, \"that my praise is not a\nlover's praise, but the truth. You do not know what all around you\nsee in Esther Summerson, how many hearts she touches and awakens,\nwhat sacred admiration and what love she wins.\"\n\n\"Oh, Mr. Woodcourt,\" cried I, \"it is a great thing to win love, it is\na great thing to win love! I am proud of it, and honoured by it; and\nthe hearing of it causes me to shed these tears of mingled joy and\nsorrow--joy that I have won it, sorrow that I have not deserved it\nbetter; but I am not free to think of yours.\"\n\nI said it with a stronger heart, for when he praised me thus and when\nI heard his voice thrill with his belief that what he said was true,\nI aspired to be more worthy of it. It was not too late for that.\nAlthough I closed this unforeseen page in my life to-night, I could\nbe worthier of it all through my life. And it was a comfort to me,\nand an impulse to me, and I felt a dignity rise up within me that was\nderived from him when I thought so.\n\nHe broke the silence.\n\n\"I should poorly show the trust that I have in the dear one who will\nevermore be as dear to me as now\"--and the deep earnestness with\nwhich he said it at once strengthened me and made me weep--\"if, after\nher assurance that she is not free to think of my love, I urged it.\nDear Esther, let me only tell you that the fond idea of you which I\ntook abroad was exalted to the heavens when I came home. I have\nalways hoped, in the first hour when I seemed to stand in any ray of\ngood fortune, to tell you this. I have always feared that I should\ntell it you in vain. My hopes and fears are both fulfilled to-night.\nI distress you. I have said enough.\"\n\nSomething seemed to pass into my place that was like the angel he\nthought me, and I felt so sorrowful for the loss he had sustained! I\nwished to help him in his trouble, as I had wished to do when he\nshowed that first commiseration for me.\n\n\"Dear Mr. Woodcourt,\" said I, \"before we part to-night, something is\nleft for me to say. I never could say it as I wish--I never\nshall--but--\"\n\nI had to think again of being more deserving of his love and his\naffliction before I could go on.\n\n\"--I am deeply sensible of your generosity, and I shall treasure its\nremembrance to my dying hour. I know full well how changed I am, I\nknow you are not unacquainted with my history, and I know what a\nnoble love that is which is so faithful. What you have said to me\ncould have affected me so much from no other lips, for there are none\nthat could give it such a value to me. It shall not be lost. It shall\nmake me better.\"\n\nHe covered his eyes with his hand and turned away his head. How could\nI ever be worthy of those tears?\n\n\"If, in the unchanged intercourse we shall have together--in tending\nRichard and Ada, and I hope in many happier scenes of life--you ever\nfind anything in me which you can honestly think is better than it\nused to be, believe that it will have sprung up from to-night and\nthat I shall owe it to you. And never believe, dear dear Mr.\nWoodcourt, never believe that I forget this night or that while my\nheart beats it can be insensible to the pride and joy of having been\nbeloved by you.\"\n\nHe took my hand and kissed it. He was like himself again, and I felt\nstill more encouraged.\n\n\"I am induced by what you said just now,\" said I, \"to hope that you\nhave succeeded in your endeavour.\"\n\n\"I have,\" he answered. \"With such help from Mr. Jarndyce as you who\nknow him so well can imagine him to have rendered me, I have\nsucceeded.\"\n\n\"Heaven bless him for it,\" said I, giving him my hand; \"and heaven\nbless you in all you do!\"\n\n\"I shall do it better for the wish,\" he answered; \"it will make me\nenter on these new duties as on another sacred trust from you.\"\n\n\"Ah! Richard!\" I exclaimed involuntarily, \"What will he do when you\nare gone!\"\n\n\"I am not required to go yet; I would not desert him, dear Miss\nSummerson, even if I were.\"\n\nOne other thing I felt it needful to touch upon before he left me. I\nknew that I should not be worthier of the love I could not take if I\nreserved it.\n\n\"Mr. Woodcourt,\" said I, \"you will be glad to know from my lips\nbefore I say good night that in the future, which is clear and bright\nbefore me, I am most happy, most fortunate, have nothing to regret or\ndesire.\"\n\nIt was indeed a glad hearing to him, he replied.\n\n\"From my childhood I have been,\" said I, \"the object of the untiring\ngoodness of the best of human beings, to whom I am so bound by every\ntie of attachment, gratitude, and love, that nothing I could do in\nthe compass of a life could express the feelings of a single day.\"\n\n\"I share those feelings,\" he returned. \"You speak of Mr. Jarndyce.\"\n\n\"You know his virtues well,\" said I, \"but few can know the greatness\nof his character as I know it. All its highest and best qualities\nhave been revealed to me in nothing more brightly than in the shaping\nout of that future in which I am so happy. And if your highest homage\nand respect had not been his already--which I know they are--they\nwould have been his, I think, on this assurance and in the feeling it\nwould have awakened in you towards him for my sake.\"\n\nHe fervently replied that indeed indeed they would have been. I gave\nhim my hand again.\n\n\"Good night,\" I said, \"Good-bye.\"\n\n\"The first until we meet to-morrow, the second as a farewell to this\ntheme between us for ever.\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Good night; good-bye.\"\n\nHe left me, and I stood at the dark window watching the street. His\nlove, in all its constancy and generosity, had come so suddenly upon\nme that he had not left me a minute when my fortitude gave way again\nand the street was blotted out by my rushing tears.\n\nBut they were not tears of regret and sorrow. No. He had called me\nthe beloved of his life and had said I would be evermore as dear to\nhim as I was then, and I felt as if my heart would not hold the\ntriumph of having heard those words. My first wild thought had died\naway. It was not too late to hear them, for it was not too late to be\nanimated by them to be good, true, grateful, and contented. How easy\nmy path, how much easier than his!\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXII\n\nAnother Discovery\n\n\nI had not the courage to see any one that night. I had not even the\ncourage to see myself, for I was afraid that my tears might a little\nreproach me. I went up to my room in the dark, and prayed in the\ndark, and lay down in the dark to sleep. I had no need of any light\nto read my guardian's letter by, for I knew it by heart. I took it\nfrom the place where I kept it, and repeated its contents by its own\nclear light of integrity and love, and went to sleep with it on my\npillow.\n\nI was up very early in the morning and called Charley to come for a\nwalk. We bought flowers for the breakfast-table, and came back and\narranged them, and were as busy as possible. We were so early that I\nhad a good time still for Charley's lesson before breakfast; Charley\n(who was not in the least improved in the old defective article of\ngrammar) came through it with great applause; and we were altogether\nvery notable. When my guardian appeared he said, \"Why, little woman,\nyou look fresher than your flowers!\" And Mrs. Woodcourt repeated and\ntranslated a passage from the Mewlinnwillinwodd expressive of my\nbeing like a mountain with the sun upon it.\n\nThis was all so pleasant that I hope it made me still more like the\nmountain than I had been before. After breakfast I waited my\nopportunity and peeped about a little until I saw my guardian in his\nown room--the room of last night--by himself. Then I made an excuse\nto go in with my housekeeping keys, shutting the door after me.\n\n\"Well, Dame Durden?\" said my guardian; the post had brought him\nseveral letters, and he was writing. \"You want money?\"\n\n\"No, indeed, I have plenty in hand.\"\n\n\"There never was such a Dame Durden,\" said my guardian, \"for making\nmoney last.\"\n\nHe had laid down his pen and leaned back in his chair looking at me.\nI have often spoken of his bright face, but I thought I had never\nseen it look so bright and good. There was a high happiness upon it\nwhich made me think, \"He has been doing some great kindness this\nmorning.\"\n\n\"There never was,\" said my guardian, musing as he smiled upon me,\n\"such a Dame Durden for making money last.\"\n\nHe had never yet altered his old manner. I loved it and him so much\nthat when I now went up to him and took my usual chair, which was\nalways put at his side--for sometimes I read to him, and sometimes I\ntalked to him, and sometimes I silently worked by him--I hardly liked\nto disturb it by laying my hand on his breast. But I found I did not\ndisturb it at all.\n\n\"Dear guardian,\" said I, \"I want to speak to you. Have I been remiss\nin anything?\"\n\n\"Remiss in anything, my dear!\"\n\n\"Have I not been what I have meant to be since--I brought the answer\nto your letter, guardian?\"\n\n\"You have been everything I could desire, my love.\"\n\n\"I am very glad indeed to hear that,\" I returned. \"You know, you said\nto me, was this the mistress of Bleak House. And I said, yes.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said my guardian, nodding his head. He had put his arm about\nme as if there were something to protect me from and looked in my\nface, smiling.\n\n\"Since then,\" said I, \"we have never spoken on the subject except\nonce.\"\n\n\"And then I said Bleak House was thinning fast; and so it was, my\ndear.\"\n\n\"And I said,\" I timidly reminded him, \"but its mistress remained.\"\n\nHe still held me in the same protecting manner and with the same\nbright goodness in his face.\n\n\"Dear guardian,\" said I, \"I know how you have felt all that has\nhappened, and how considerate you have been. As so much time has\npassed, and as you spoke only this morning of my being so well again,\nperhaps you expect me to renew the subject. Perhaps I ought to do so.\nI will be the mistress of Bleak House when you please.\"\n\n\"See,\" he returned gaily, \"what a sympathy there must be between us!\nI have had nothing else, poor Rick excepted--it's a large\nexception--in my mind. When you came in, I was full of it. When shall\nwe give Bleak House its mistress, little woman?\"\n\n\"When you please.\"\n\n\"Next month?\"\n\n\"Next month, dear guardian.\"\n\n\"The day on which I take the happiest and best step of my life--the\nday on which I shall be a man more exulting and more enviable than\nany other man in the world--the day on which I give Bleak House its\nlittle mistress--shall be next month then,\" said my guardian.\n\nI put my arms round his neck and kissed him just as I had done on the\nday when I brought my answer.\n\nA servant came to the door to announce Mr. Bucket, which was quite\nunnecessary, for Mr. Bucket was already looking in over the servant's\nshoulder. \"Mr. Jarndyce and Miss Summerson,\" said he, rather out of\nbreath, \"with all apologies for intruding, WILL you allow me to order\nup a person that's on the stairs and that objects to being left there\nin case of becoming the subject of observations in his absence? Thank\nyou. Be so good as chair that there member in this direction, will\nyou?\" said Mr. Bucket, beckoning over the banisters.\n\nThis singular request produced an old man in a black skull-cap,\nunable to walk, who was carried up by a couple of bearers and\ndeposited in the room near the door. Mr. Bucket immediately got rid\nof the bearers, mysteriously shut the door, and bolted it.\n\n\"Now you see, Mr. Jarndyce,\" he then began, putting down his hat and\nopening his subject with a flourish of his well-remembered finger,\n\"you know me, and Miss Summerson knows me. This gentleman likewise\nknows me, and his name is Smallweed. The discounting line is his line\nprincipally, and he's what you may call a dealer in bills. That's\nabout what YOU are, you know, ain't you?\" said Mr. Bucket, stopping a\nlittle to address the gentleman in question, who was exceedingly\nsuspicious of him.\n\nHe seemed about to dispute this designation of himself when he was\nseized with a violent fit of coughing.\n\n\"Now, moral, you know!\" said Mr. Bucket, improving the accident.\n\"Don't you contradict when there ain't no occasion, and you won't be\ntook in that way. Now, Mr. Jarndyce, I address myself to you. I've\nbeen negotiating with this gentleman on behalf of Sir Leicester\nDedlock, Baronet, and one way and another I've been in and out and\nabout his premises a deal. His premises are the premises formerly\noccupied by Krook, marine store dealer--a relation of this\ngentleman's that you saw in his lifetime if I don't mistake?\"\n\nMy guardian replied, \"Yes.\"\n\n\"Well! You are to understand,\" said Mr. Bucket, \"that this gentleman\nhe come into Krook's property, and a good deal of magpie property\nthere was. Vast lots of waste-paper among the rest. Lord bless you,\nof no use to nobody!\"\n\nThe cunning of Mr. Bucket's eye and the masterly manner in which he\ncontrived, without a look or a word against which his watchful\nauditor could protest, to let us know that he stated the case\naccording to previous agreement and could say much more of Mr.\nSmallweed if he thought it advisable, deprived us of any merit in\nquite understanding him. His difficulty was increased by Mr.\nSmallweed's being deaf as well as suspicious and watching his face\nwith the closest attention.\n\n\"Among them odd heaps of old papers, this gentleman, when he comes\ninto the property, naturally begins to rummage, don't you see?\" said\nMr. Bucket.\n\n\"To which? Say that again,\" cried Mr. Smallweed in a shrill, sharp\nvoice.\n\n\"To rummage,\" repeated Mr. Bucket. \"Being a prudent man and\naccustomed to take care of your own affairs, you begin to rummage\namong the papers as you have come into; don't you?\"\n\n\"Of course I do,\" cried Mr. Smallweed.\n\n\"Of course you do,\" said Mr. Bucket conversationally, \"and much to\nblame you would be if you didn't. And so you chance to find, you\nknow,\" Mr. Bucket went on, stooping over him with an air of cheerful\nraillery which Mr. Smallweed by no means reciprocated, \"and so you\nchance to find, you know, a paper with the signature of Jarndyce to\nit. Don't you?\"\n\nMr. Smallweed glanced with a troubled eye at us and grudgingly nodded\nassent.\n\n\"And coming to look at that paper at your full leisure and\nconvenience--all in good time, for you're not curious to read it, and\nwhy should you be?--what do you find it to be but a will, you see.\nThat's the drollery of it,\" said Mr. Bucket with the same lively air\nof recalling a joke for the enjoyment of Mr. Smallweed, who still had\nthe same crest-fallen appearance of not enjoying it at all; \"what do\nyou find it to be but a will?\"\n\n\"I don't know that it's good as a will or as anything else,\" snarled\nMr. Smallweed.\n\nMr. Bucket eyed the old man for a moment--he had slipped and shrunk\ndown in his chair into a mere bundle--as if he were much disposed to\npounce upon him; nevertheless, he continued to bend over him with the\nsame agreeable air, keeping the corner of one of his eyes upon us.\n\n\"Notwithstanding which,\" said Mr. Bucket, \"you get a little doubtful\nand uncomfortable in your mind about it, having a very tender mind of\nyour own.\"\n\n\"Eh? What do you say I have got of my own?\" asked Mr. Smallweed with\nhis hand to his ear.\n\n\"A very tender mind.\"\n\n\"Ho! Well, go on,\" said Mr. Smallweed.\n\n\"And as you've heard a good deal mentioned regarding a celebrated\nChancery will case of the same name, and as you know what a card\nKrook was for buying all manner of old pieces of furniter, and books,\nand papers, and what not, and never liking to part with 'em, and\nalways a-going to teach himself to read, you begin to think--and you\nnever was more correct in your born days--'Ecod, if I don't look\nabout me, I may get into trouble regarding this will.'\"\n\n\"Now, mind how you put it, Bucket,\" cried the old man anxiously with\nhis hand at his ear. \"Speak up; none of your brimstone tricks. Pick\nme up; I want to hear better. Oh, Lord, I am shaken to bits!\"\n\nMr. Bucket had certainly picked him up at a dart. However, as soon as\nhe could be heard through Mr. Smallweed's coughing and his vicious\nejaculations of \"Oh, my bones! Oh, dear! I've no breath in my body!\nI'm worse than the chattering, clattering, brimstone pig at home!\"\nMr. Bucket proceeded in the same convivial manner as before.\n\n\"So, as I happen to be in the habit of coming about your premises,\nyou take me into your confidence, don't you?\"\n\nI think it would be impossible to make an admission with more ill\nwill and a worse grace than Mr. Smallweed displayed when he admitted\nthis, rendering it perfectly evident that Mr. Bucket was the very\nlast person he would have thought of taking into his confidence if he\ncould by any possibility have kept him out of it.\n\n\"And I go into the business with you--very pleasant we are over it;\nand I confirm you in your well-founded fears that you will get\nyourself into a most precious line if you don't come out with that\nthere will,\" said Mr. Bucket emphatically; \"and accordingly you\narrange with me that it shall be delivered up to this present Mr.\nJarndyce, on no conditions. If it should prove to be valuable, you\ntrusting yourself to him for your reward; that's about where it is,\nain't it?\"\n\n\"That's what was agreed,\" Mr. Smallweed assented with the same bad\ngrace.\n\n\"In consequence of which,\" said Mr. Bucket, dismissing his agreeable\nmanner all at once and becoming strictly business-like, \"you've got\nthat will upon your person at the present time, and the only thing\nthat remains for you to do is just to out with it!\"\n\nHaving given us one glance out of the watching corner of his eye, and\nhaving given his nose one triumphant rub with his forefinger, Mr.\nBucket stood with his eyes fastened on his confidential friend and\nhis hand stretched forth ready to take the paper and present it to my\nguardian. It was not produced without much reluctance and many\ndeclarations on the part of Mr. Smallweed that he was a poor\nindustrious man and that he left it to Mr. Jarndyce's honour not to\nlet him lose by his honesty. Little by little he very slowly took\nfrom a breast-pocket a stained, discoloured paper which was much\nsinged upon the outside and a little burnt at the edges, as if it had\nlong ago been thrown upon a fire and hastily snatched off again. Mr.\nBucket lost no time in transferring this paper, with the dexterity of\na conjuror, from Mr. Smallweed to Mr. Jarndyce. As he gave it to my\nguardian, he whispered behind his fingers, \"Hadn't settled how to\nmake their market of it. Quarrelled and hinted about it. I laid out\ntwenty pound upon it. First the avaricious grandchildren split upon\nhim on account of their objections to his living so unreasonably\nlong, and then they split on one another. Lord! There ain't one of\nthe family that wouldn't sell the other for a pound or two, except\nthe old lady--and she's only out of it because she's too weak in her\nmind to drive a bargain.\"\n\n\"Mr Bucket,\" said my guardian aloud, \"whatever the worth of this\npaper may be to any one, my obligations are great to you; and if it\nbe of any worth, I hold myself bound to see Mr. Smallweed remunerated\naccordingly.\"\n\n\"Not according to your merits, you know,\" said Mr. Bucket in friendly\nexplanation to Mr. Smallweed. \"Don't you be afraid of that. According\nto its value.\"\n\n\"That is what I mean,\" said my guardian. \"You may observe, Mr.\nBucket, that I abstain from examining this paper myself. The plain\ntruth is, I have forsworn and abjured the whole business these many\nyears, and my soul is sick of it. But Miss Summerson and I will\nimmediately place the paper in the hands of my solicitor in the\ncause, and its existence shall be made known without delay to all\nother parties interested.\"\n\n\"Mr. Jarndyce can't say fairer than that, you understand,\" observed\nMr. Bucket to his fellow-visitor. \"And it being now made clear to you\nthat nobody's a-going to be wronged--which must be a great relief to\nYOUR mind--we may proceed with the ceremony of chairing you home\nagain.\"\n\nHe unbolted the door, called in the bearers, wished us good morning,\nand with a look full of meaning and a crook of his finger at parting\nwent his way.\n\nWe went our way too, which was to Lincoln's Inn, as quickly as\npossible. Mr. Kenge was disengaged, and we found him at his table in\nhis dusty room with the inexpressive-looking books and the piles of\npapers. Chairs having been placed for us by Mr. Guppy, Mr. Kenge\nexpressed the surprise and gratification he felt at the unusual sight\nof Mr. Jarndyce in his office. He turned over his double eye-glass as\nhe spoke and was more Conversation Kenge than ever.\n\n\"I hope,\" said Mr. Kenge, \"that the genial influence of Miss\nSummerson,\" he bowed to me, \"may have induced Mr. Jarndyce,\" he bowed\nto him, \"to forego some little of his animosity towards a cause and\ntowards a court which are--shall I say, which take their place in the\nstately vista of the pillars of our profession?\"\n\n\"I am inclined to think,\" returned my guardian, \"that Miss Summerson\nhas seen too much of the effects of the court and the cause to exert\nany influence in their favour. Nevertheless, they are a part of the\noccasion of my being here. Mr. Kenge, before I lay this paper on your\ndesk and have done with it, let me tell you how it has come into my\nhands.\"\n\nHe did so shortly and distinctly.\n\n\"It could not, sir,\" said Mr. Kenge, \"have been stated more plainly\nand to the purpose if it had been a case at law.\"\n\n\"Did you ever know English law, or equity either, plain and to the\npurpose?\" said my guardian.\n\n\"Oh, fie!\" said Mr. Kenge.\n\nAt first he had not seemed to attach much importance to the paper,\nbut when he saw it he appeared more interested, and when he had\nopened and read a little of it through his eye-glass, he became\namazed. \"Mr. Jarndyce,\" he said, looking off it, \"you have perused\nthis?\"\n\n\"Not I!\" returned my guardian.\n\n\"But, my dear sir,\" said Mr. Kenge, \"it is a will of later date than\nany in the suit. It appears to be all in the testator's handwriting.\nIt is duly executed and attested. And even if intended to be\ncancelled, as might possibly be supposed to be denoted by these marks\nof fire, it is NOT cancelled. Here it is, a perfect instrument!\"\n\n\"Well!\" said my guardian. \"What is that to me?\"\n\n\"Mr. Guppy!\" cried Mr. Kenge, raising his voice. \"I beg your pardon,\nMr. Jarndyce.\"\n\n\"Sir.\"\n\n\"Mr. Vholes of Symond's Inn. My compliments. Jarndyce and Jarndyce.\nGlad to speak with him.\"\n\nMr. Guppy disappeared.\n\n\"You ask me what is this to you, Mr. Jarndyce. If you had perused\nthis document, you would have seen that it reduces your interest\nconsiderably, though still leaving it a very handsome one, still\nleaving it a very handsome one,\" said Mr. Kenge, waving his hand\npersuasively and blandly. \"You would further have seen that the\ninterests of Mr. Richard Carstone and of Miss Ada Clare, now Mrs.\nRichard Carstone, are very materially advanced by it.\"\n\n\"Kenge,\" said my guardian, \"if all the flourishing wealth that the\nsuit brought into this vile court of Chancery could fall to my two\nyoung cousins, I should be well contented. But do you ask ME to\nbelieve that any good is to come of Jarndyce and Jarndyce?\"\n\n\"Oh, really, Mr. Jarndyce! Prejudice, prejudice. My dear sir, this is\na very great country, a very great country. Its system of equity is a\nvery great system, a very great system. Really, really!\"\n\nMy guardian said no more, and Mr. Vholes arrived. He was modestly\nimpressed by Mr. Kenge's professional eminence.\n\n\"How do you do, Mr. Vholes? Will you be so good as to take a chair\nhere by me and look over this paper?\"\n\nMr. Vholes did as he was asked and seemed to read it every word. He\nwas not excited by it, but he was not excited by anything. When he\nhad well examined it, he retired with Mr. Kenge into a window, and\nshading his mouth with his black glove, spoke to him at some length.\nI was not surprised to observe Mr. Kenge inclined to dispute what\nhe said before he had said much, for I knew that no two people ever\ndid agree about anything in Jarndyce and Jarndyce. But he seemed\nto get the better of Mr. Kenge too in a conversation that sounded\nas if it were almost composed of the words \"Receiver-General,\"\n\"Accountant-General,\" \"report,\" \"estate,\" and \"costs.\" When they had\nfinished, they came back to Mr. Kenge's table and spoke aloud.\n\n\"Well! But this is a very remarkable document, Mr. Vholes,\" said Mr.\nKenge.\n\nMr. Vholes said, \"Very much so.\"\n\n\"And a very important document, Mr. Vholes,\" said Mr. Kenge.\n\nAgain Mr. Vholes said, \"Very much so.\"\n\n\"And as you say, Mr. Vholes, when the cause is in the paper next\nterm, this document will be an unexpected and interesting feature in\nit,\" said Mr. Kenge, looking loftily at my guardian.\n\nMr. Vholes was gratified, as a smaller practitioner striving to keep\nrespectable, to be confirmed in any opinion of his own by such an\nauthority.\n\n\"And when,\" asked my guardian, rising after a pause, during which Mr.\nKenge had rattled his money and Mr. Vholes had picked his pimples,\n\"when is next term?\"\n\n\"Next term, Mr. Jarndyce, will be next month,\" said Mr. Kenge. \"Of\ncourse we shall at once proceed to do what is necessary with this\ndocument and to collect the necessary evidence concerning it; and of\ncourse you will receive our usual notification of the cause being in\nthe paper.\"\n\n\"To which I shall pay, of course, my usual attention.\"\n\n\"Still bent, my dear sir,\" said Mr. Kenge, showing us through the\nouter office to the door, \"still bent, even with your enlarged mind,\non echoing a popular prejudice? We are a prosperous community, Mr.\nJarndyce, a very prosperous community. We are a great country, Mr.\nJarndyce, we are a very great country. This is a great system, Mr.\nJarndyce, and would you wish a great country to have a little system?\nNow, really, really!\"\n\nHe said this at the stair-head, gently moving his right hand as if it\nwere a silver trowel with which to spread the cement of his words on\nthe structure of the system and consolidate it for a thousand ages.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXIII\n\nSteel and Iron\n\n\nGeorge's Shooting Gallery is to let, and the stock is sold off, and\nGeorge himself is at Chesney Wold attending on Sir Leicester in his\nrides and riding very near his bridle-rein because of the uncertain\nhand with which he guides his horse. But not to-day is George so\noccupied. He is journeying to-day into the iron country farther north\nto look about him.\n\nAs he comes into the iron country farther north, such fresh green\nwoods as those of Chesney Wold are left behind; and coal pits and\nashes, high chimneys and red bricks, blighted verdure, scorching\nfires, and a heavy never-lightening cloud of smoke become the\nfeatures of the scenery. Among such objects rides the trooper,\nlooking about him and always looking for something he has come to\nfind.\n\nAt last, on the black canal bridge of a busy town, with a clang of\niron in it, and more fires and more smoke than he has seen yet, the\ntrooper, swart with the dust of the coal roads, checks his horse and\nasks a workman does he know the name of Rouncewell thereabouts.\n\n\"Why, master,\" quoth the workman, \"do I know my own name?\"\n\n\"'Tis so well known here, is it, comrade?\" asks the trooper.\n\n\"Rouncewell's? Ah! You're right.\"\n\n\"And where might it be now?\" asks the trooper with a glance before\nhim.\n\n\"The bank, the factory, or the house?\" the workman wants to know.\n\n\"Hum! Rouncewell's is so great apparently,\" mutters the trooper,\nstroking his chin, \"that I have as good as half a mind to go back\nagain. Why, I don't know which I want. Should I find Mr. Rouncewell\nat the factory, do you think?\"\n\n\"Tain't easy to say where you'd find him--at this time of the day you\nmight find either him or his son there, if he's in town; but his\ncontracts take him away.\"\n\nAnd which is the factory? Why, he sees those chimneys--the tallest\nones! Yes, he sees THEM. Well! Let him keep his eye on those\nchimneys, going on as straight as ever he can, and presently he'll\nsee 'em down a turning on the left, shut in by a great brick wall\nwhich forms one side of the street. That's Rouncewell's.\n\nThe trooper thanks his informant and rides slowly on, looking about\nhim. He does not turn back, but puts up his horse (and is much\ndisposed to groom him too) at a public-house where some of\nRouncewell's hands are dining, as the ostler tells him. Some of\nRouncewell's hands have just knocked off for dinner-time and seem to\nbe invading the whole town. They are very sinewy and strong, are\nRouncewell's hands--a little sooty too.\n\nHe comes to a gateway in the brick wall, looks in, and sees a great\nperplexity of iron lying about in every stage and in a vast variety\nof shapes--in bars, in wedges, in sheets; in tanks, in boilers, in\naxles, in wheels, in cogs, in cranks, in rails; twisted and wrenched\ninto eccentric and perverse forms as separate parts of machinery;\nmountains of it broken up, and rusty in its age; distant furnaces of\nit glowing and bubbling in its youth; bright fireworks of it\nshowering about under the blows of the steam-hammer; red-hot iron,\nwhite-hot iron, cold-black iron; an iron taste, an iron smell, and a\nBabel of iron sounds.\n\n\"This is a place to make a man's head ache too!\" says the trooper,\nlooking about him for a counting-house. \"Who comes here? This is very\nlike me before I was set up. This ought to be my nephew, if\nlikenesses run in families. Your servant, sir.\"\n\n\"Yours, sir. Are you looking for any one?\"\n\n\"Excuse me. Young Mr. Rouncewell, I believe?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"I was looking for your father, sir. I wish to have a word with him.\"\n\nThe young man, telling him he is fortunate in his choice of a time,\nfor his father is there, leads the way to the office where he is to\nbe found. \"Very like me before I was set up--devilish like me!\"\nthinks the trooper as he follows. They come to a building in the yard\nwith an office on an upper floor. At sight of the gentleman in the\noffice, Mr. George turns very red.\n\n\"What name shall I say to my father?\" asks the young man.\n\nGeorge, full of the idea of iron, in desperation answers \"Steel,\" and\nis so presented. He is left alone with the gentleman in the office,\nwho sits at a table with account-books before him and some sheets of\npaper blotted with hosts of figures and drawings of cunning shapes.\nIt is a bare office, with bare windows, looking on the iron view\nbelow. Tumbled together on the table are some pieces of iron,\npurposely broken to be tested at various periods of their service, in\nvarious capacities. There is iron-dust on everything; and the smoke\nis seen through the windows rolling heavily out of the tall chimneys\nto mingle with the smoke from a vaporous Babylon of other chimneys.\n\n\"I am at your service, Mr. Steel,\" says the gentleman when his\nvisitor has taken a rusty chair.\n\n\"Well, Mr. Rouncewell,\" George replies, leaning forward with his left\narm on his knee and his hat in his hand, and very chary of meeting\nhis brother's eye, \"I am not without my expectations that in the\npresent visit I may prove to be more free than welcome. I have served\nas a dragoon in my day, and a comrade of mine that I was once rather\npartial to was, if I don't deceive myself, a brother of yours. I\nbelieve you had a brother who gave his family some trouble, and ran\naway, and never did any good but in keeping away?\"\n\n\"Are you quite sure,\" returns the ironmaster in an altered voice,\n\"that your name is Steel?\"\n\nThe trooper falters and looks at him. His brother starts up, calls\nhim by his name, and grasps him by both hands.\n\n\"You are too quick for me!\" cries the trooper with the tears\nspringing out of his eyes. \"How do you do, my dear old fellow? I\nnever could have thought you would have been half so glad to see me\nas all this. How do you do, my dear old fellow, how do you do!\"\n\nThey shake hands and embrace each other over and over again, the\ntrooper still coupling his \"How do you do, my dear old fellow!\" with\nhis protestation that he never thought his brother would have been\nhalf so glad to see him as all this!\n\n\"So far from it,\" he declares at the end of a full account of what\nhas preceded his arrival there, \"I had very little idea of making\nmyself known. I thought if you took by any means forgivingly to my\nname I might gradually get myself up to the point of writing a\nletter. But I should not have been surprised, brother, if you had\nconsidered it anything but welcome news to hear of me.\"\n\n\"We will show you at home what kind of news we think it, George,\"\nreturns his brother. \"This is a great day at home, and you could not\nhave arrived, you bronzed old soldier, on a better. I make an\nagreement with my son Watt to-day that on this day twelvemonth he\nshall marry as pretty and as good a girl as you have seen in all your\ntravels. She goes to Germany to-morrow with one of your nieces for a\nlittle polishing up in her education. We make a feast of the event,\nand you will be made the hero of it.\"\n\nMr. George is so entirely overcome at first by this prospect that he\nresists the proposed honour with great earnestness. Being overborne,\nhowever, by his brother and his nephew--concerning whom he renews his\nprotestations that he never could have thought they would have been\nhalf so glad to see him--he is taken home to an elegant house in all\nthe arrangements of which there is to be observed a pleasant mixture\nof the originally simple habits of the father and mother with such as\nare suited to their altered station and the higher fortunes of their\nchildren. Here Mr. George is much dismayed by the graces and\naccomplishments of his nieces that are and by the beauty of Rosa, his\nniece that is to be, and by the affectionate salutations of these\nyoung ladies, which he receives in a sort of dream. He is sorely\ntaken aback, too, by the dutiful behaviour of his nephew and has a\nwoeful consciousness upon him of being a scapegrace. However, there\nis great rejoicing and a very hearty company and infinite enjoyment,\nand Mr. George comes bluff and martial through it all, and his pledge\nto be present at the marriage and give away the bride is received\nwith universal favour. A whirling head has Mr. George that night when\nhe lies down in the state-bed of his brother's house to think of all\nthese things and to see the images of his nieces (awful all the\nevening in their floating muslins) waltzing, after the German manner,\nover his counterpane.\n\nThe brothers are closeted next morning in the ironmaster's room,\nwhere the elder is proceeding, in his clear sensible way, to show how\nhe thinks he may best dispose of George in his business, when George\nsqueezes his hand and stops him.\n\n\"Brother, I thank you a million times for your more than brotherly\nwelcome, and a million times more to that for your more than\nbrotherly intentions. But my plans are made. Before I say a word as\nto them, I wish to consult you upon one family point. How,\" says the\ntrooper, folding his arms and looking with indomitable firmness at\nhis brother, \"how is my mother to be got to scratch me?\"\n\n\"I am not sure that I understand you, George,\" replies the\nironmaster.\n\n\"I say, brother, how is my mother to be got to scratch me? She must\nbe got to do it somehow.\"\n\n\"Scratch you out of her will, I think you mean?\"\n\n\"Of course I do. In short,\" says the trooper, folding his arms more\nresolutely yet, \"I mean--TO--scratch me!\"\n\n\"My dear George,\" returns his brother, \"is it so indispensable that\nyou should undergo that process?\"\n\n\"Quite! Absolutely! I couldn't be guilty of the meanness of coming\nback without it. I should never be safe not to be off again. I have\nnot sneaked home to rob your children, if not yourself, brother, of\nyour rights. I, who forfeited mine long ago! If I am to remain and\nhold up my head, I must be scratched. Come. You are a man of\ncelebrated penetration and intelligence, and you can tell me how it's\nto be brought about.\"\n\n\"I can tell you, George,\" replies the ironmaster deliberately, \"how\nit is not to be brought about, which I hope may answer the purpose as\nwell. Look at our mother, think of her, recall her emotion when she\nrecovered you. Do you believe there is a consideration in the world\nthat would induce her to take such a step against her favourite son?\nDo you believe there is any chance of her consent, to balance against\nthe outrage it would be to her (loving dear old lady!) to propose it?\nIf you do, you are wrong. No, George! You must make up your mind to\nremain UNscratched, I think.\" There is an amused smile on the\nironmaster's face as he watches his brother, who is pondering, deeply\ndisappointed. \"I think you may manage almost as well as if the thing\nwere done, though.\"\n\n\"How, brother?\"\n\n\"Being bent upon it, you can dispose by will of anything you have the\nmisfortune to inherit in any way you like, you know.\"\n\n\"That's true!\" says the trooper, pondering again. Then he wistfully\nasks, with his hand on his brother's, \"Would you mind mentioning\nthat, brother, to your wife and family?\"\n\n\"Not at all.\"\n\n\"Thank you. You wouldn't object to say, perhaps, that although an\nundoubted vagabond, I am a vagabond of the harum-scarum order, and\nnot of the mean sort?\"\n\nThe ironmaster, repressing his amused smile, assents.\n\n\"Thank you. Thank you. It's a weight off my mind,\" says the trooper\nwith a heave of his chest as he unfolds his arms and puts a hand on\neach leg, \"though I had set my heart on being scratched, too!\"\n\nThe brothers are very like each other, sitting face to face; but a\ncertain massive simplicity and absence of usage in the ways of the\nworld is all on the trooper's side.\n\n\"Well,\" he proceeds, throwing off his disappointment, \"next and last,\nthose plans of mine. You have been so brotherly as to propose to me\nto fall in here and take my place among the products of your\nperseverance and sense. I thank you heartily. It's more than\nbrotherly, as I said before, and I thank you heartily for it,\"\nshaking him a long time by the hand. \"But the truth is, brother, I am\na--I am a kind of a weed, and it's too late to plant me in a regular\ngarden.\"\n\n\"My dear George,\" returns the elder, concentrating his strong steady\nbrow upon him and smiling confidently, \"leave that to me, and let me\ntry.\"\n\nGeorge shakes his head. \"You could do it, I have not a doubt, if\nanybody could; but it's not to be done. Not to be done, sir! Whereas\nit so falls out, on the other hand, that I am able to be of some\ntrifle of use to Sir Leicester Dedlock since his illness--brought on\nby family sorrows--and that he would rather have that help from our\nmother's son than from anybody else.\"\n\n\"Well, my dear George,\" returns the other with a very slight shade\nupon his open face, \"if you prefer to serve in Sir Leicester\nDedlock's household brigade--\"\n\n\"There it is, brother,\" cries the trooper, checking him, with his\nhand upon his knee again; \"there it is! You don't take kindly to that\nidea; I don't mind it. You are not used to being officered; I am.\nEverything about you is in perfect order and discipline; everything\nabout me requires to be kept so. We are not accustomed to carry\nthings with the same hand or to look at 'em from the same point. I\ndon't say much about my garrison manners because I found myself\npretty well at my ease last night, and they wouldn't be noticed here,\nI dare say, once and away. But I shall get on best at Chesney Wold,\nwhere there's more room for a weed than there is here; and the dear\nold lady will be made happy besides. Therefore I accept of Sir\nLeicester Dedlock's proposals. When I come over next year to give\naway the bride, or whenever I come, I shall have the sense to keep\nthe household brigade in ambuscade and not to manoeuvre it on your\nground. I thank you heartily again and am proud to think of the\nRouncewells as they'll be founded by you.\"\n\n\"You know yourself, George,\" says the elder brother, returning the\ngrip of his hand, \"and perhaps you know me better than I know myself.\nTake your way. So that we don't quite lose one another again, take\nyour way.\"\n\n\"No fear of that!\" returns the trooper. \"Now, before I turn my\nhorse's head homewards, brother, I will ask you--if you'll be so\ngood--to look over a letter for me. I brought it with me to send from\nthese parts, as Chesney Wold might be a painful name just now to the\nperson it's written to. I am not much accustomed to correspondence\nmyself, and I am particular respecting this present letter because I\nwant it to be both straightforward and delicate.\"\n\nHerewith he hands a letter, closely written in somewhat pale ink but\nin a neat round hand, to the ironmaster, who reads as follows:\n\n\n   Miss Esther Summerson,\n\n   A communication having been made to me by Inspector Bucket\n   of a letter to myself being found among the papers of a\n   certain person, I take the liberty to make known to you\n   that it was but a few lines of instruction from abroad,\n   when, where, and how to deliver an enclosed letter to a\n   young and beautiful lady, then unmarried, in England. I\n   duly observed the same.\n\n   I further take the liberty to make known to you that it\n   was got from me as a proof of handwriting only and that\n   otherwise I would not have given it up, as appearing to\n   be the most harmless in my possession, without being\n   previously shot through the heart.\n\n   I further take the liberty to mention that if I could have\n   supposed a certain unfortunate gentleman to have been in\n   existence, I never could and never would have rested until\n   I had discovered his retreat and shared my last farthing\n   with him, as my duty and my inclination would have equally\n   been. But he was (officially) reported drowned, and\n   assuredly went over the side of a transport-ship at night\n   in an Irish harbour within a few hours of her arrival from\n   the West Indies, as I have myself heard both from officers\n   and men on board, and know to have been (officially)\n   confirmed.\n\n   I further take the liberty to state that in my humble\n   quality as one of the rank and file, I am, and shall ever\n   continue to be, your thoroughly devoted and admiring\n   servant and that I esteem the qualities you possess above\n   all others far beyond the limits of the present dispatch.\n\n   I have the honour to be,\n\n   GEORGE\n\n\n\"A little formal,\" observes the elder brother, refolding it with a\npuzzled face.\n\n\"But nothing that might not be sent to a pattern young lady?\" asks\nthe younger.\n\n\"Nothing at all.\"\n\nTherefore it is sealed and deposited for posting among the iron\ncorrespondence of the day. This done, Mr. George takes a hearty\nfarewell of the family party and prepares to saddle and mount. His\nbrother, however, unwilling to part with him so soon, proposes to\nride with him in a light open carriage to the place where he will\nbait for the night, and there remain with him until morning, a\nservant riding for so much of the journey on the thoroughbred old\ngrey from Chesney Wold. The offer, being gladly accepted, is followed\nby a pleasant ride, a pleasant dinner, and a pleasant breakfast, all\nin brotherly communion. Then they once more shake hands long and\nheartily and part, the ironmaster turning his face to the smoke and\nfires, and the trooper to the green country. Early in the afternoon\nthe subdued sound of his heavy military trot is heard on the turf in\nthe avenue as he rides on with imaginary clank and jingle of\naccoutrements under the old elm-trees.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXIV\n\nEsther's Narrative\n\n\nSoon after I had that conversation with my guardian, he put a sealed\npaper in my hand one morning and said, \"This is for next month, my\ndear.\" I found in it two hundred pounds.\n\nI now began very quietly to make such preparations as I thought were\nnecessary. Regulating my purchases by my guardian's taste, which I\nknew very well of course, I arranged my wardrobe to please him and\nhoped I should be highly successful. I did it all so quietly because\nI was not quite free from my old apprehension that Ada would be\nrather sorry and because my guardian was so quiet himself. I had no\ndoubt that under all the circumstances we should be married in the\nmost private and simple manner. Perhaps I should only have to say to\nAda, \"Would you like to come and see me married to-morrow, my pet?\"\nPerhaps our wedding might even be as unpretending as her own, and I\nmight not find it necessary to say anything about it until it was\nover. I thought that if I were to choose, I would like this best.\n\nThe only exception I made was Mrs. Woodcourt. I told her that I was\ngoing to be married to my guardian and that we had been engaged some\ntime. She highly approved. She could never do enough for me and was\nremarkably softened now in comparison with what she had been when we\nfirst knew her. There was no trouble she would not have taken to have\nbeen of use to me, but I need hardly say that I only allowed her to\ntake as little as gratified her kindness without tasking it.\n\nOf course this was not a time to neglect my guardian, and of course\nit was not a time for neglecting my darling. So I had plenty of\noccupation, which I was glad of; and as to Charley, she was\nabsolutely not to be seen for needlework. To surround herself with\ngreat heaps of it--baskets full and tables full--and do a little, and\nspend a great deal of time in staring with her round eyes at what\nthere was to do, and persuade herself that she was going to do it,\nwere Charley's great dignities and delights.\n\nMeanwhile, I must say, I could not agree with my guardian on the\nsubject of the will, and I had some sanguine hopes of Jarndyce and\nJarndyce. Which of us was right will soon appear, but I certainly did\nencourage expectations. In Richard, the discovery gave occasion for a\nburst of business and agitation that buoyed him up for a little time,\nbut he had lost the elasticity even of hope now and seemed to me to\nretain only its feverish anxieties. From something my guardian said\none day when we were talking about this, I understood that my\nmarriage would not take place until after the term-time we had been\ntold to look forward to; and I thought the more, for that, how\nrejoiced I should be if I could be married when Richard and Ada were\na little more prosperous.\n\nThe term was very near indeed when my guardian was called out of town\nand went down into Yorkshire on Mr. Woodcourt's business. He had told\nme beforehand that his presence there would be necessary. I had just\ncome in one night from my dear girl's and was sitting in the midst of\nall my new clothes, looking at them all around me and thinking, when\na letter from my guardian was brought to me. It asked me to join him\nin the country and mentioned by what stage-coach my place was taken\nand at what time in the morning I should have to leave town. It added\nin a postscript that I would not be many hours from Ada.\n\nI expected few things less than a journey at that time, but I was\nready for it in half an hour and set off as appointed early next\nmorning. I travelled all day, wondering all day what I could be\nwanted for at such a distance; now I thought it might be for this\npurpose, and now I thought it might be for that purpose, but I was\nnever, never, never near the truth.\n\nIt was night when I came to my journey's end and found my guardian\nwaiting for me. This was a great relief, for towards evening I had\nbegun to fear (the more so as his letter was a very short one) that\nhe might be ill. However, there he was, as well as it was possible to\nbe; and when I saw his genial face again at its brightest and best, I\nsaid to myself, he has been doing some other great kindness. Not that\nit required much penetration to say that, because I knew that his\nbeing there at all was an act of kindness.\n\nSupper was ready at the hotel, and when we were alone at table he\nsaid, \"Full of curiosity, no doubt, little woman, to know why I have\nbrought you here?\"\n\n\"Well, guardian,\" said I, \"without thinking myself a Fatima or you a\nBlue Beard, I am a little curious about it.\"\n\n\"Then to ensure your night's rest, my love,\" he returned gaily, \"I\nwon't wait until to-morrow to tell you. I have very much wished to\nexpress to Woodcourt, somehow, my sense of his humanity to poor\nunfortunate Jo, his inestimable services to my young cousins, and his\nvalue to us all. When it was decided that he should settle here, it\ncame into my head that I might ask his acceptance of some\nunpretending and suitable little place to lay his own head in. I\ntherefore caused such a place to be looked out for, and such a place\nwas found on very easy terms, and I have been touching it up for him\nand making it habitable. However, when I walked over it the day\nbefore yesterday and it was reported ready, I found that I was not\nhousekeeper enough to know whether things were all as they ought to\nbe. So I sent off for the best little housekeeper that could possibly\nbe got to come and give me her advice and opinion. And here she is,\"\nsaid my guardian, \"laughing and crying both together!\"\n\nBecause he was so dear, so good, so admirable. I tried to tell him\nwhat I thought of him, but I could not articulate a word.\n\n\"Tut, tut!\" said my guardian. \"You make too much of it, little woman.\nWhy, how you sob, Dame Durden, how you sob!\"\n\n\"It is with exquisite pleasure, guardian--with a heart full of\nthanks.\"\n\n\"Well, well,\" said he. \"I am delighted that you approve. I thought\nyou would. I meant it as a pleasant surprise for the little mistress\nof Bleak House.\"\n\nI kissed him and dried my eyes. \"I know now!\" said I. \"I have seen\nthis in your face a long while.\"\n\n\"No; have you really, my dear?\" said he. \"What a Dame Durden it is to\nread a face!\"\n\nHe was so quaintly cheerful that I could not long be otherwise, and\nwas almost ashamed of having been otherwise at all. When I went to\nbed, I cried. I am bound to confess that I cried; but I hope it was\nwith pleasure, though I am not quite sure it was with pleasure. I\nrepeated every word of the letter twice over.\n\nA most beautiful summer morning succeeded, and after breakfast we\nwent out arm in arm to see the house of which I was to give my mighty\nhousekeeping opinion. We entered a flower-garden by a gate in a side\nwall, of which he had the key, and the first thing I saw was that the\nbeds and flowers were all laid out according to the manner of my beds\nand flowers at home.\n\n\"You see, my dear,\" observed my guardian, standing still with a\ndelighted face to watch my looks, \"knowing there could be no better\nplan, I borrowed yours.\"\n\nWe went on by a pretty little orchard, where the cherries were\nnestling among the green leaves and the shadows of the apple-trees\nwere sporting on the grass, to the house itself--a cottage, quite a\nrustic cottage of doll's rooms; but such a lovely place, so tranquil\nand so beautiful, with such a rich and smiling country spread around\nit; with water sparkling away into the distance, here all overhung\nwith summer-growth, there turning a humming mill; at its nearest\npoint glancing through a meadow by the cheerful town, where\ncricket-players were assembling in bright groups and a flag was\nflying from a white tent that rippled in the sweet west wind. And\nstill, as we went through the pretty rooms, out at the little rustic\nverandah doors, and underneath the tiny wooden colonnades garlanded\nwith woodbine, jasmine, and honey-suckle, I saw in the papering on\nthe walls, in the colours of the furniture, in the arrangement of all\nthe pretty objects, MY little tastes and fancies, MY little methods\nand inventions which they used to laugh at while they praised them,\nmy odd ways everywhere.\n\nI could not say enough in admiration of what was all so beautiful,\nbut one secret doubt arose in my mind when I saw this, I thought, oh,\nwould he be the happier for it! Would it not have been better for his\npeace that I should not have been so brought before him? Because\nalthough I was not what he thought me, still he loved me very dearly,\nand it might remind him mournfully of what be believed he had lost. I\ndid not wish him to forget me--perhaps he might not have done so,\nwithout these aids to his memory--but my way was easier than his, and\nI could have reconciled myself even to that so that he had been the\nhappier for it.\n\n\"And now, little woman,\" said my guardian, whom I had never seen so\nproud and joyful as in showing me these things and watching my\nappreciation of them, \"now, last of all, for the name of this house.\"\n\n\"What is it called, dear guardian?\"\n\n\"My child,\" said he, \"come and see,\"\n\nHe took me to the porch, which he had hitherto avoided, and said,\npausing before we went out, \"My dear child, don't you guess the\nname?\"\n\n\"No!\" said I.\n\nWe went out of the porch and he showed me written over it, Bleak\nHouse.\n\nHe led me to a seat among the leaves close by, and sitting down\nbeside me and taking my hand in his, spoke to me thus, \"My darling\ngirl, in what there has been between us, I have, I hope, been really\nsolicitous for your happiness. When I wrote you the letter to which\nyou brought the answer,\" smiling as he referred to it, \"I had my own\ntoo much in view; but I had yours too. Whether, under different\ncircumstances, I might ever have renewed the old dream I sometimes\ndreamed when you were very young, of making you my wife one day, I\nneed not ask myself. I did renew it, and I wrote my letter, and you\nbrought your answer. You are following what I say, my child?\"\n\nI was cold, and I trembled violently, but not a word he uttered was\nlost. As I sat looking fixedly at him and the sun's rays descended,\nsoftly shining through the leaves upon his bare head, I felt as if\nthe brightness on him must be like the brightness of the angels.\n\n\"Hear me, my love, but do not speak. It is for me to speak now. When\nit was that I began to doubt whether what I had done would really\nmake you happy is no matter. Woodcourt came home, and I soon had no\ndoubt at all.\"\n\nI clasped him round the neck and hung my head upon his breast and\nwept. \"Lie lightly, confidently here, my child,\" said he, pressing me\ngently to him. \"I am your guardian and your father now. Rest\nconfidently here.\"\n\nSoothingly, like the gentle rustling of the leaves; and genially,\nlike the ripening weather; and radiantly and beneficently, like the\nsunshine, he went on.\n\n\"Understand me, my dear girl. I had no doubt of your being contented\nand happy with me, being so dutiful and so devoted; but I saw with\nwhom you would be happier. That I penetrated his secret when Dame\nDurden was blind to it is no wonder, for I knew the good that could\nnever change in her better far than she did. Well! I have long been\nin Allan Woodcourt's confidence, although he was not, until\nyesterday, a few hours before you came here, in mine. But I would not\nhave my Esther's bright example lost; I would not have a jot of my\ndear girl's virtues unobserved and unhonoured; I would not have her\nadmitted on sufferance into the line of Morgan ap-Kerrig, no, not for\nthe weight in gold of all the mountains in Wales!\"\n\nHe stopped to kiss me on the forehead, and I sobbed and wept afresh.\nFor I felt as if I could not bear the painful delight of his praise.\n\n\"Hush, little woman! Don't cry; this is to be a day of joy. I have\nlooked forward to it,\" he said exultingly, \"for months on months! A\nfew words more, Dame Trot, and I have said my say. Determined not to\nthrow away one atom of my Esther's worth, I took Mrs. Woodcourt into\na separate confidence. 'Now, madam,' said I, 'I clearly perceive--and\nindeed I know, to boot--that your son loves my ward. I am further\nvery sure that my ward loves your son, but will sacrifice her love to\na sense of duty and affection, and will sacrifice it so completely,\nso entirely, so religiously, that you should never suspect it though\nyou watched her night and day.' Then I told her all our\nstory--ours--yours and mine. 'Now, madam,' said I, 'come you, knowing\nthis, and live with us. Come you, and see my child from hour to hour;\nset what you see against her pedigree, which is this, and this'--for\nI scorned to mince it--'and tell me what is the true legitimacy when\nyou shall have quite made up your mind on that subject.' Why, honour\nto her old Welsh blood, my dear,\" cried my guardian with enthusiasm,\n\"I believe the heart it animates beats no less warmly, no less\nadmiringly, no less lovingly, towards Dame Durden than my own!\"\n\nHe tenderly raised my head, and as I clung to him, kissed me in his\nold fatherly way again and again. What a light, now, on the\nprotecting manner I had thought about!\n\n\"One more last word. When Allan Woodcourt spoke to you, my dear, he\nspoke with my knowledge and consent--but I gave him no encouragement,\nnot I, for these surprises were my great reward, and I was too\nmiserly to part with a scrap of it. He was to come and tell me all\nthat passed, and he did. I have no more to say. My dearest, Allan\nWoodcourt stood beside your father when he lay dead--stood beside\nyour mother. This is Bleak House. This day I give this house its\nlittle mistress; and before God, it is the brightest day in all my\nlife!\"\n\nHe rose and raised me with him. We were no longer alone. My\nhusband--I have called him by that name full seven happy years\nnow--stood at my side.\n\n\"Allan,\" said my guardian, \"take from me a willing gift, the best\nwife that ever man had. What more can I say for you than that I know\nyou deserve her! Take with her the little home she brings you. You\nknow what she will make it, Allan; you know what she has made its\nnamesake. Let me share its felicity sometimes, and what do I\nsacrifice? Nothing, nothing.\"\n\nHe kissed me once again, and now the tears were in his eyes as he\nsaid more softly, \"Esther, my dearest, after so many years, there is\na kind of parting in this too. I know that my mistake has caused you\nsome distress. Forgive your old guardian, in restoring him to his old\nplace in your affections; and blot it out of your memory. Allan, take\nmy dear.\"\n\nHe moved away from under the green roof of leaves, and stopping in\nthe sunlight outside and turning cheerfully towards us, said, \"I\nshall be found about here somewhere. It's a west wind, little woman,\ndue west! Let no one thank me any more, for I am going to revert to\nmy bachelor habits, and if anybody disregards this warning, I'll run\naway and never come back!\"\n\nWhat happiness was ours that day, what joy, what rest, what hope,\nwhat gratitude, what bliss! We were to be married before the month\nwas out, but when we were to come and take possession of our own\nhouse was to depend on Richard and Ada.\n\nWe all three went home together next day. As soon as we arrived in\ntown, Allan went straight to see Richard and to carry our joyful news\nto him and my darling. Late as it was, I meant to go to her for a few\nminutes before lying down to sleep, but I went home with my guardian\nfirst to make his tea for him and to occupy the old chair by his\nside, for I did not like to think of its being empty so soon.\n\nWhen we came home we found that a young man had called three times in\nthe course of that one day to see me and that having been told on the\noccasion of his third call that I was not expected to return before\nten o'clock at night, he had left word that he would call about then.\nHe had left his card three times. Mr. Guppy.\n\nAs I naturally speculated on the object of these visits, and as I\nalways associated something ludicrous with the visitor, it fell out\nthat in laughing about Mr. Guppy I told my guardian of his old\nproposal and his subsequent retraction. \"After that,\" said my\nguardian, \"we will certainly receive this hero.\" So instructions were\ngiven that Mr. Guppy should be shown in when he came again, and they\nwere scarcely given when he did come again.\n\nHe was embarrassed when he found my guardian with me, but recovered\nhimself and said, \"How de do, sir?\"\n\n\"How do you do, sir?\" returned my guardian.\n\n\"Thank you, sir, I am tolerable,\" returned Mr. Guppy. \"Will you allow\nme to introduce my mother, Mrs. Guppy of the Old Street Road, and my\nparticular friend, Mr. Weevle. That is to say, my friend has gone by\nthe name of Weevle, but his name is really and truly Jobling.\"\n\nMy guardian begged them to be seated, and they all sat down.\n\n\"Tony,\" said Mr. Guppy to his friend after an awkward silence. \"Will\nyou open the case?\"\n\n\"Do it yourself,\" returned the friend rather tartly.\n\n\"Well, Mr. Jarndyce, sir,\" Mr. Guppy, after a moment's consideration,\nbegan, to the great diversion of his mother, which she displayed by\nnudging Mr. Jobling with her elbow and winking at me in a most\nremarkable manner, \"I had an idea that I should see Miss Summerson by\nherself and was not quite prepared for your esteemed presence. But\nMiss Summerson has mentioned to you, perhaps, that something has\npassed between us on former occasions?\"\n\n\"Miss Summerson,\" returned my guardian, smiling, \"has made a\ncommunication to that effect to me.\"\n\n\"That,\" said Mr. Guppy, \"makes matters easier. Sir, I have come out\nof my articles at Kenge and Carboy's, and I believe with satisfaction\nto all parties. I am now admitted (after undergoing an examination\nthat's enough to badger a man blue, touching a pack of nonsense that\nhe don't want to know) on the roll of attorneys and have taken out my\ncertificate, if it would be any satisfaction to you to see it.\"\n\n\"Thank you, Mr. Guppy,\" returned my guardian. \"I am quite willing--I\nbelieve I use a legal phrase--to admit the certificate.\"\n\nMr. Guppy therefore desisted from taking something out of his pocket\nand proceeded without it.\n\n\"I have no capital myself, but my mother has a little property which\ntakes the form of an annuity\"--here Mr. Guppy's mother rolled her\nhead as if she never could sufficiently enjoy the observation, and\nput her handkerchief to her mouth, and again winked at me--\"and a few\npounds for expenses out of pocket in conducting business will never\nbe wanting, free of interest, which is an advantage, you know,\" said\nMr. Guppy feelingly.\n\n\"Certainly an advantage,\" returned my guardian.\n\n\"I HAVE some connexion,\" pursued Mr. Guppy, \"and it lays in the\ndirection of Walcot Square, Lambeth. I have therefore taken a 'ouse\nin that locality, which, in the opinion of my friends, is a hollow\nbargain (taxes ridiculous, and use of fixtures included in the rent),\nand intend setting up professionally for myself there forthwith.\"\n\nHere Mr. Guppy's mother fell into an extraordinary passion of rolling\nher head and smiling waggishly at anybody who would look at her.\n\n\"It's a six-roomer, exclusive of kitchens,\" said Mr. Guppy, \"and in\nthe opinion of my friends, a commodious tenement. When I mention my\nfriends, I refer principally to my friend Jobling, who I believe has\nknown me,\" Mr. Guppy looked at him with a sentimental air, \"from\nboyhood's hour.\"\n\nMr. Jobling confirmed this with a sliding movement of his legs.\n\n\"My friend Jobling will render me his assistance in the capacity of\nclerk and will live in the 'ouse,\" said Mr. Guppy. \"My mother will\nlikewise live in the 'ouse when her present quarter in the Old Street\nRoad shall have ceased and expired; and consequently there will be no\nwant of society. My friend Jobling is naturally aristocratic by\ntaste, and besides being acquainted with the movements of the upper\ncircles, fully backs me in the intentions I am now developing.\"\n\nMr. Jobling said \"Certainly\" and withdrew a little from the elbow of\nMr Guppy's mother.\n\n\"Now, I have no occasion to mention to you, sir, you being in the\nconfidence of Miss Summerson,\" said Mr. Guppy, \"(mother, I wish you'd\nbe so good as to keep still), that Miss Summerson's image was\nformerly imprinted on my 'eart and that I made her a proposal of\nmarriage.\"\n\n\"That I have heard,\" returned my guardian.\n\n\"Circumstances,\" pursued Mr. Guppy, \"over which I had no control, but\nquite the contrary, weakened the impression of that image for a time.\nAt which time Miss Summerson's conduct was highly genteel; I may even\nadd, magnanimous.\"\n\nMy guardian patted me on the shoulder and seemed much amused.\n\n\"Now, sir,\" said Mr. Guppy, \"I have got into that state of mind\nmyself that I wish for a reciprocity of magnanimous behaviour. I wish\nto prove to Miss Summerson that I can rise to a heighth of which\nperhaps she hardly thought me capable. I find that the image which I\ndid suppose had been eradicated from my 'eart is NOT eradicated. Its\ninfluence over me is still tremenjous, and yielding to it, I am\nwilling to overlook the circumstances over which none of us have had\nany control and to renew those proposals to Miss Summerson which I\nhad the honour to make at a former period. I beg to lay the 'ouse in\nWalcot Square, the business, and myself before Miss Summerson for her\nacceptance.\"\n\n\"Very magnanimous indeed, sir,\" observed my guardian.\n\n\"Well, sir,\" replied Mr. Guppy with candour, \"my wish is to BE\nmagnanimous. I do not consider that in making this offer to Miss\nSummerson I am by any means throwing myself away; neither is that the\nopinion of my friends. Still, there are circumstances which I submit\nmay be taken into account as a set off against any little drawbacks\nof mine, and so a fair and equitable balance arrived at.\"\n\n\"I take upon myself, sir,\" said my guardian, laughing as he rang the\nbell, \"to reply to your proposals on behalf of Miss Summerson. She is\nvery sensible of your handsome intentions, and wishes you good\nevening, and wishes you well.\"\n\n\"Oh!\" said Mr. Guppy with a blank look. \"Is that tantamount, sir, to\nacceptance, or rejection, or consideration?\"\n\n\"To decided rejection, if you please,\" returned my guardian.\n\nMr. Guppy looked incredulously at his friend, and at his mother, who\nsuddenly turned very angry, and at the floor, and at the ceiling.\n\n\"Indeed?\" said he. \"Then, Jobling, if you was the friend you\nrepresent yourself, I should think you might hand my mother out of\nthe gangway instead of allowing her to remain where she ain't\nwanted.\"\n\nBut Mrs. Guppy positively refused to come out of the gangway. She\nwouldn't hear of it. \"Why, get along with you,\" said she to my\nguardian, \"what do you mean? Ain't my son good enough for you? You\nought to be ashamed of yourself. Get out with you!\"\n\n\"My good lady,\" returned my guardian, \"it is hardly reasonable to ask\nme to get out of my own room.\"\n\n\"I don't care for that,\" said Mrs. Guppy. \"Get out with you. If we\nain't good enough for you, go and procure somebody that is good\nenough. Go along and find 'em.\"\n\nI was quite unprepared for the rapid manner in which Mrs. Guppy's\npower of jocularity merged into a power of taking the profoundest\noffence.\n\n\"Go along and find somebody that's good enough for you,\" repeated\nMrs. Guppy. \"Get out!\" Nothing seemed to astonish Mr. Guppy's mother\nso much and to make her so very indignant as our not getting out.\n\"Why don't you get out?\" said Mrs. Guppy. \"What are you stopping here\nfor?\"\n\n\"Mother,\" interposed her son, always getting before her and pushing\nher back with one shoulder as she sidled at my guardian, \"WILL you\nhold your tongue?\"\n\n\"No, William,\" she returned, \"I won't! Not unless he gets out, I\nwon't!\"\n\nHowever, Mr. Guppy and Mr. Jobling together closed on Mr. Guppy's\nmother (who began to be quite abusive) and took her, very much\nagainst her will, downstairs, her voice rising a stair higher every\ntime her figure got a stair lower, and insisting that we should\nimmediately go and find somebody who was good enough for us, and\nabove all things that we should get out.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXV\n\nBeginning the World\n\n\nThe term had commenced, and my guardian found an intimation from Mr.\nKenge that the cause would come on in two days. As I had sufficient\nhopes of the will to be in a flutter about it, Allan and I agreed to\ngo down to the court that morning. Richard was extremely agitated and\nwas so weak and low, though his illness was still of the mind, that\nmy dear girl indeed had sore occasion to be supported. But she looked\nforward--a very little way now--to the help that was to come to her,\nand never drooped.\n\nIt was at Westminster that the cause was to come on. It had come on\nthere, I dare say, a hundred times before, but I could not divest\nmyself of an idea that it MIGHT lead to some result now. We left home\ndirectly after breakfast to be at Westminster Hall in good time and\nwalked down there through the lively streets--so happily and\nstrangely it seemed!--together.\n\nAs we were going along, planning what we should do for Richard and\nAda, I heard somebody calling \"Esther! My dear Esther! Esther!\" And\nthere was Caddy Jellyby, with her head out of the window of a little\ncarriage which she hired now to go about in to her pupils (she had so\nmany), as if she wanted to embrace me at a hundred yards' distance. I\nhad written her a note to tell her of all that my guardian had done,\nbut had not had a moment to go and see her. Of course we turned back,\nand the affectionate girl was in that state of rapture, and was so\noverjoyed to talk about the night when she brought me the flowers,\nand was so determined to squeeze my face (bonnet and all) between her\nhands, and go on in a wild manner altogether, calling me all kinds of\nprecious names, and telling Allan I had done I don't know what for\nher, that I was just obliged to get into the little carriage and calm\nher down by letting her say and do exactly what she liked. Allan,\nstanding at the window, was as pleased as Caddy; and I was as pleased\nas either of them; and I wonder that I got away as I did, rather than\nthat I came off laughing, and red, and anything but tidy, and looking\nafter Caddy, who looked after us out of the coach-window as long as\nshe could see us.\n\nThis made us some quarter of an hour late, and when we came to\nWestminster Hall we found that the day's business was begun. Worse\nthan that, we found such an unusual crowd in the Court of Chancery\nthat it was full to the door, and we could neither see nor hear what\nwas passing within. It appeared to be something droll, for\noccasionally there was a laugh and a cry of \"Silence!\" It appeared to\nbe something interesting, for every one was pushing and striving to\nget nearer. It appeared to be something that made the professional\ngentlemen very merry, for there were several young counsellors in\nwigs and whiskers on the outside of the crowd, and when one of them\ntold the others about it, they put their hands in their pockets, and\nquite doubled themselves up with laughter, and went stamping about\nthe pavement of the Hall.\n\nWe asked a gentleman by us if he knew what cause was on. He told us\nJarndyce and Jarndyce. We asked him if he knew what was doing in it.\nHe said really, no he did not, nobody ever did, but as well as he\ncould make out, it was over. Over for the day? we asked him. No, he\nsaid, over for good.\n\nOver for good!\n\nWhen we heard this unaccountable answer, we looked at one another\nquite lost in amazement. Could it be possible that the will had set\nthings right at last and that Richard and Ada were going to be rich?\nIt seemed too good to be true. Alas it was!\n\nOur suspense was short, for a break-up soon took place in the crowd,\nand the people came streaming out looking flushed and hot and\nbringing a quantity of bad air with them. Still they were all\nexceedingly amused and were more like people coming out from a farce\nor a juggler than from a court of justice. We stood aside, watching\nfor any countenance we knew, and presently great bundles of paper\nbegan to be carried out--bundles in bags, bundles too large to be got\ninto any bags, immense masses of papers of all shapes and no shapes,\nwhich the bearers staggered under, and threw down for the time being,\nanyhow, on the Hall pavement, while they went back to bring out more.\nEven these clerks were laughing. We glanced at the papers, and seeing\nJarndyce and Jarndyce everywhere, asked an official-looking person\nwho was standing in the midst of them whether the cause was over.\nYes, he said, it was all up with it at last, and burst out laughing\ntoo.\n\nAt this juncture we perceived Mr. Kenge coming out of court with an\naffable dignity upon him, listening to Mr. Vholes, who was\ndeferential and carried his own bag. Mr. Vholes was the first to see\nus. \"Here is Miss Summerson, sir,\" he said. \"And Mr. Woodcourt.\"\n\n\"Oh, indeed! Yes. Truly!\" said Mr. Kenge, raising his hat to me with\npolished politeness. \"How do you do? Glad to see you. Mr. Jarndyce is\nnot here?\"\n\nNo. He never came there, I reminded him.\n\n\"Really,\" returned Mr. Kenge, \"it is as well that he is NOT here\nto-day, for his--shall I say, in my good friend's absence, his\nindomitable singularity of opinion?--might have been strengthened,\nperhaps; not reasonably, but might have been strengthened.\"\n\n\"Pray what has been done to-day?\" asked Allan.\n\n\"I beg your pardon?\" said Mr. Kenge with excessive urbanity.\n\n\"What has been done to-day?\"\n\n\"What has been done,\" repeated Mr. Kenge. \"Quite so. Yes. Why, not\nmuch has been done; not much. We have been checked--brought up\nsuddenly, I would say--upon the--shall I term it threshold?\"\n\n\"Is this will considered a genuine document, sir?\" said Allan. \"Will\nyou tell us that?\"\n\n\"Most certainly, if I could,\" said Mr. Kenge; \"but we have not gone\ninto that, we have not gone into that.\"\n\n\"We have not gone into that,\" repeated Mr. Vholes as if his low\ninward voice were an echo.\n\n\"You are to reflect, Mr. Woodcourt,\" observed Mr. Kenge, using his\nsilver trowel persuasively and smoothingly, \"that this has been a\ngreat cause, that this has been a protracted cause, that this has\nbeen a complex cause. Jarndyce and Jarndyce has been termed, not\ninaptly, a monument of Chancery practice.\"\n\n\"And patience has sat upon it a long time,\" said Allan.\n\n\"Very well indeed, sir,\" returned Mr. Kenge with a certain\ncondescending laugh he had. \"Very well! You are further to reflect,\nMr. Woodcourt,\" becoming dignified almost to severity, \"that on the\nnumerous difficulties, contingencies, masterly fictions, and forms of\nprocedure in this great cause, there has been expended study,\nability, eloquence, knowledge, intellect, Mr. Woodcourt, high\nintellect. For many years, the--a--I would say the flower of the bar,\nand the--a--I would presume to add, the matured autumnal fruits of\nthe woolsack--have been lavished upon Jarndyce and Jarndyce. If the\npublic have the benefit, and if the country have the adornment, of\nthis great grasp, it must be paid for in money or money's worth,\nsir.\"\n\n\"Mr. Kenge,\" said Allan, appearing enlightened all in a moment.\n\"Excuse me, our time presses. Do I understand that the whole estate\nis found to have been absorbed in costs?\"\n\n\"Hem! I believe so,\" returned Mr. Kenge. \"Mr. Vholes, what do YOU\nsay?\"\n\n\"I believe so,\" said Mr. Vholes.\n\n\"And that thus the suit lapses and melts away?\"\n\n\"Probably,\" returned Mr. Kenge. \"Mr. Vholes?\"\n\n\"Probably,\" said Mr. Vholes.\n\n\"My dearest life,\" whispered Allan, \"this will break Richard's\nheart!\"\n\nThere was such a shock of apprehension in his face, and he knew\nRichard so perfectly, and I too had seen so much of his gradual\ndecay, that what my dear girl had said to me in the fullness of her\nforeboding love sounded like a knell in my ears.\n\n\"In case you should be wanting Mr. C., sir,\" said Mr. Vholes, coming\nafter us, \"you'll find him in court. I left him there resting himself\na little. Good day, sir; good day, Miss Summerson.\" As he gave me\nthat slowly devouring look of his, while twisting up the strings of\nhis bag before he hastened with it after Mr. Kenge, the benignant\nshadow of whose conversational presence he seemed afraid to leave, he\ngave one gasp as if he had swallowed the last morsel of his client,\nand his black buttoned-up unwholesome figure glided away to the low\ndoor at the end of the Hall.\n\n\"My dear love,\" said Allan, \"leave to me, for a little while, the\ncharge you gave me. Go home with this intelligence and come to Ada's\nby and by!\"\n\nI would not let him take me to a coach, but entreated him to go to\nRichard without a moment's delay and leave me to do as he wished.\nHurrying home, I found my guardian and told him gradually with what\nnews I had returned. \"Little woman,\" said he, quite unmoved for\nhimself, \"to have done with the suit on any terms is a greater\nblessing than I had looked for. But my poor young cousins!\"\n\nWe talked about them all the morning and discussed what it was\npossible to do. In the afternoon my guardian walked with me to\nSymond's Inn and left me at the door. I went upstairs. When my\ndarling heard my footsteps, she came out into the small passage and\nthrew her arms round my neck, but she composed herself directly and\nsaid that Richard had asked for me several times. Allan had found him\nsitting in the corner of the court, she told me, like a stone figure.\nOn being roused, he had broken away and made as if he would have\nspoken in a fierce voice to the judge. He was stopped by his mouth\nbeing full of blood, and Allan had brought him home.\n\nHe was lying on a sofa with his eyes closed when I went in. There\nwere restoratives on the table; the room was made as airy as\npossible, and was darkened, and was very orderly and quiet. Allan\nstood behind him watching him gravely. His face appeared to me to be\nquite destitute of colour, and now that I saw him without his seeing\nme, I fully saw, for the first time, how worn away he was. But he\nlooked handsomer than I had seen him look for many a day.\n\nI sat down by his side in silence. Opening his eyes by and by, he\nsaid in a weak voice, but with his old smile, \"Dame Durden, kiss me,\nmy dear!\"\n\nIt was a great comfort and surprise to me to find him in his low\nstate cheerful and looking forward. He was happier, he said, in our\nintended marriage than he could find words to tell me. My husband had\nbeen a guardian angel to him and Ada, and he blessed us both and\nwished us all the joy that life could yield us. I almost felt as if\nmy own heart would have broken when I saw him take my husband's hand\nand hold it to his breast.\n\nWe spoke of the future as much as possible, and he said several times\nthat he must be present at our marriage if he could stand upon his\nfeet. Ada would contrive to take him, somehow, he said. \"Yes, surely,\ndearest Richard!\" But as my darling answered him thus hopefully, so\nserene and beautiful, with the help that was to come to her so\nnear--I knew--I knew!\n\nIt was not good for him to talk too much, and when he was silent, we\nwere silent too. Sitting beside him, I made a pretence of working for\nmy dear, as he had always been used to joke about my being busy. Ada\nleaned upon his pillow, holding his head upon her arm. He dozed\noften, and whenever he awoke without seeing him, said first of all,\n\"Where is Woodcourt?\"\n\nEvening had come on when I lifted up my eyes and saw my guardian\nstanding in the little hall. \"Who is that, Dame Durden?\" Richard\nasked me. The door was behind him, but he had observed in my face\nthat some one was there.\n\nI looked to Allan for advice, and as he nodded \"Yes,\" bent over\nRichard and told him. My guardian saw what passed, came softly by me\nin a moment, and laid his hand on Richard's. \"Oh, sir,\" said Richard,\n\"you are a good man, you are a good man!\" and burst into tears for\nthe first time.\n\nMy guardian, the picture of a good man, sat down in my place, keeping\nhis hand on Richard's.\n\n\"My dear Rick,\" said he, \"the clouds have cleared away, and it is\nbright now. We can see now. We were all bewildered, Rick, more or\nless. What matters! And how are you, my dear boy?\"\n\n\"I am very weak, sir, but I hope I shall be stronger. I have to begin\nthe world.\"\n\n\"Aye, truly; well said!\" cried my guardian.\n\n\"I will not begin it in the old way now,\" said Richard with a sad\nsmile. \"I have learned a lesson now, sir. It was a hard one, but you\nshall be assured, indeed, that I have learned it.\"\n\n\"Well, well,\" said my guardian, comforting him; \"well, well, well,\ndear boy!\"\n\n\"I was thinking, sir,\" resumed Richard, \"that there is nothing on\nearth I should so much like to see as their house--Dame Durden's and\nWoodcourt's house. If I could be removed there when I begin to\nrecover my strength, I feel as if I should get well there sooner than\nanywhere.\"\n\n\"Why, so have I been thinking too, Rick,\" said my guardian, \"and our\nlittle woman likewise; she and I have been talking of it this very\nday. I dare say her husband won't object. What do you think?\"\n\nRichard smiled and lifted up his arm to touch him as he stood behind\nthe head of the couch.\n\n\"I say nothing of Ada,\" said Richard, \"but I think of her, and have\nthought of her very much. Look at her! See her here, sir, bending\nover this pillow when she has so much need to rest upon it herself,\nmy dear love, my poor girl!\"\n\nHe clasped her in his arms, and none of us spoke. He gradually\nreleased her, and she looked upon us, and looked up to heaven, and\nmoved her lips.\n\n\"When I get down to Bleak House,\" said Richard, \"I shall have much to\ntell you, sir, and you will have much to show me. You will go, won't\nyou?\"\n\n\"Undoubtedly, dear Rick.\"\n\n\"Thank you; like you, like you,\" said Richard. \"But it's all like\nyou. They have been telling me how you planned it and how you\nremembered all Esther's familiar tastes and ways. It will be like\ncoming to the old Bleak House again.\"\n\n\"And you will come there too, I hope, Rick. I am a solitary man now,\nyou know, and it will be a charity to come to me. A charity to come\nto me, my love!\" he repeated to Ada as he gently passed his hand over\nher golden hair and put a lock of it to his lips. (I think he vowed\nwithin himself to cherish her if she were left alone.)\n\n\"It was a troubled dream?\" said Richard, clasping both my guardian's\nhands eagerly.\n\n\"Nothing more, Rick; nothing more.\"\n\n\"And you, being a good man, can pass it as such, and forgive and pity\nthe dreamer, and be lenient and encouraging when he wakes?\"\n\n\"Indeed I can. What am I but another dreamer, Rick?\"\n\n\"I will begin the world!\" said Richard with a light in his eyes.\n\nMy husband drew a little nearer towards Ada, and I saw him solemnly\nlift up his hand to warn my guardian.\n\n\"When shall I go from this place to that pleasant country where the\nold times are, where I shall have strength to tell what Ada has been\nto me, where I shall be able to recall my many faults and\nblindnesses, where I shall prepare myself to be a guide to my unborn\nchild?\" said Richard. \"When shall I go?\"\n\n\"Dear Rick, when you are strong enough,\" returned my guardian.\n\n\"Ada, my darling!\"\n\nHe sought to raise himself a little. Allan raised him so that she\ncould hold him on her bosom, which was what he wanted.\n\n\"I have done you many wrongs, my own. I have fallen like a poor stray\nshadow on your way, I have married you to poverty and trouble, I have\nscattered your means to the winds. You will forgive me all this, my\nAda, before I begin the world?\"\n\nA smile irradiated his face as she bent to kiss him. He slowly laid\nhis face down upon her bosom, drew his arms closer round her neck,\nand with one parting sob began the world. Not this world, oh, not\nthis! The world that sets this right.\n\nWhen all was still, at a late hour, poor crazed Miss Flite came\nweeping to me and told me she had given her birds their liberty.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXVI\n\nDown in Lincolnshire\n\n\nThere is a hush upon Chesney Wold in these altered days, as there is\nupon a portion of the family history. The story goes that Sir\nLeicester paid some who could have spoken out to hold their peace;\nbut it is a lame story, feebly whispering and creeping about, and any\nbrighter spark of life it shows soon dies away. It is known for\ncertain that the handsome Lady Dedlock lies in the mausoleum in the\npark, where the trees arch darkly overhead, and the owl is heard at\nnight making the woods ring; but whence she was brought home to be\nlaid among the echoes of that solitary place, or how she died, is all\nmystery. Some of her old friends, principally to be found among the\npeachy-cheeked charmers with the skeleton throats, did once\noccasionally say, as they toyed in a ghastly manner with large\nfans--like charmers reduced to flirting with grim death, after losing\nall their other beaux--did once occasionally say, when the world\nassembled together, that they wondered the ashes of the Dedlocks,\nentombed in the mausoleum, never rose against the profanation of her\ncompany. But the dead-and-gone Dedlocks take it very calmly and have\nnever been known to object.\n\nUp from among the fern in the hollow, and winding by the bridle-road\namong the trees, comes sometimes to this lonely spot the sound of\nhorses' hoofs. Then may be seen Sir Leicester--invalided, bent, and\nalmost blind, but of worthy presence yet--riding with a stalwart man\nbeside him, constant to his bridle-rein. When they come to a certain\nspot before the mausoleum-door, Sir Leicester's accustomed horse\nstops of his own accord, and Sir Leicester, pulling off his hat, is\nstill for a few moments before they ride away.\n\nWar rages yet with the audacious Boythorn, though at uncertain\nintervals, and now hotly, and now coolly, flickering like an unsteady\nfire. The truth is said to be that when Sir Leicester came down to\nLincolnshire for good, Mr. Boythorn showed a manifest desire to\nabandon his right of way and do whatever Sir Leicester would, which\nSir Leicester, conceiving to be a condescension to his illness or\nmisfortune, took in such high dudgeon, and was so magnificently\naggrieved by, that Mr. Boythorn found himself under the necessity of\ncommitting a flagrant trespass to restore his neighbour to himself.\nSimilarly, Mr. Boythorn continues to post tremendous placards on the\ndisputed thoroughfare and (with his bird upon his head) to hold forth\nvehemently against Sir Leicester in the sanctuary of his own home;\nsimilarly, also, he defies him as of old in the little church by\ntestifying a bland unconsciousness of his existence. But it is\nwhispered that when he is most ferocious towards his old foe, he is\nreally most considerate, and that Sir Leicester, in the dignity of\nbeing implacable, little supposes how much he is humoured. As little\ndoes he think how near together he and his antagonist have suffered\nin the fortunes of two sisters, and his antagonist, who knows it now,\nis not the man to tell him. So the quarrel goes on to the\nsatisfaction of both.\n\nIn one of the lodges of the park--that lodge within sight of the\nhouse where, once upon a time, when the waters were out down in\nLincolnshire, my Lady used to see the keeper's child--the stalwart\nman, the trooper formerly, is housed. Some relics of his old calling\nhang upon the walls, and these it is the chosen recreation of a\nlittle lame man about the stable-yard to keep gleaming bright. A busy\nlittle man he always is, in the polishing at harness-house doors, of\nstirrup-irons, bits, curb-chains, harness bosses, anything in the way\nof a stable-yard that will take a polish, leading a life of friction.\nA shaggy little damaged man, withal, not unlike an old dog of some\nmongrel breed, who has been considerably knocked about. He answers to\nthe name of Phil.\n\nA goodly sight it is to see the grand old housekeeper (harder of\nhearing now) going to church on the arm of her son and to\nobserve--which few do, for the house is scant of company in these\ntimes--the relations of both towards Sir Leicester, and his towards\nthem. They have visitors in the high summer weather, when a grey\ncloak and umbrella, unknown to Chesney Wold at other periods, are\nseen among the leaves; when two young ladies are occasionally found\ngambolling in sequestered saw-pits and such nooks of the park; and\nwhen the smoke of two pipes wreathes away into the fragrant evening\nair from the trooper's door. Then is a fife heard trolling within the\nlodge on the inspiring topic of the \"British Grenadiers\"; and as the\nevening closes in, a gruff inflexible voice is heard to say, while\ntwo men pace together up and down, \"But I never own to it before the\nold girl. Discipline must be maintained.\"\n\nThe greater part of the house is shut up, and it is a show-house no\nlonger; yet Sir Leicester holds his shrunken state in the long\ndrawing-room for all that, and reposes in his old place before my\nLady's picture. Closed in by night with broad screens, and illumined\nonly in that part, the light of the drawing-room seems gradually\ncontracting and dwindling until it shall be no more. A little more,\nin truth, and it will be all extinguished for Sir Leicester; and the\ndamp door in the mausoleum which shuts so tight, and looks so\nobdurate, will have opened and received him.\n\nVolumnia, growing with the flight of time pinker as to the red in her\nface, and yellower as to the white, reads to Sir Leicester in the\nlong evenings and is driven to various artifices to conceal her\nyawns, of which the chief and most efficacious is the insertion of\nthe pearl necklace between her rosy lips. Long-winded treatises on\nthe Buffy and Boodle question, showing how Buffy is immaculate and\nBoodle villainous, and how the country is lost by being all Boodle\nand no Buffy, or saved by being all Buffy and no Boodle (it must be\none of the two, and cannot be anything else), are the staple of her\nreading. Sir Leicester is not particular what it is and does not\nappear to follow it very closely, further than that he always comes\nbroad awake the moment Volumnia ventures to leave off, and sonorously\nrepeating her last words, begs with some displeasure to know if she\nfinds herself fatigued. However, Volumnia, in the course of her\nbird-like hopping about and pecking at papers, has alighted on a\nmemorandum concerning herself in the event of \"anything happening\" to\nher kinsman, which is handsome compensation for an extensive course\nof reading and holds even the dragon Boredom at bay.\n\nThe cousins generally are rather shy of Chesney Wold in its dullness,\nbut take to it a little in the shooting season, when guns are heard\nin the plantations, and a few scattered beaters and keepers wait at\nthe old places of appointment for low-spirited twos and threes of\ncousins. The debilitated cousin, more debilitated by the dreariness\nof the place, gets into a fearful state of depression, groaning under\npenitential sofa-pillows in his gunless hours and protesting that\nsuch fernal old jail's--nough t'sew fler up--frever.\n\nThe only great occasions for Volumnia in this changed aspect of the\nplace in Lincolnshire are those occasions, rare and widely separated,\nwhen something is to be done for the county or the country in the way\nof gracing a public ball. Then, indeed, does the tuckered sylph come\nout in fairy form and proceed with joy under cousinly escort to the\nexhausted old assembly-room, fourteen heavy miles off, which, during\nthree hundred and sixty-four days and nights of every ordinary year,\nis a kind of antipodean lumber-room full of old chairs and tables\nupside down. Then, indeed, does she captivate all hearts by her\ncondescension, by her girlish vivacity, and by her skipping about as\nin the days when the hideous old general with the mouth too full of\nteeth had not cut one of them at two guineas each. Then does she\ntwirl and twine, a pastoral nymph of good family, through the mazes\nof the dance. Then do the swains appear with tea, with lemonade, with\nsandwiches, with homage. Then is she kind and cruel, stately and\nunassuming, various, beautifully wilful. Then is there a singular\nkind of parallel between her and the little glass chandeliers of\nanother age embellishing that assembly-room, which, with their meagre\nstems, their spare little drops, their disappointing knobs where no\ndrops are, their bare little stalks from which knobs and drops have\nboth departed, and their little feeble prismatic twinkling, all seem\nVolumnias.\n\nFor the rest, Lincolnshire life to Volumnia is a vast blank of\novergrown house looking out upon trees, sighing, wringing their\nhands, bowing their heads, and casting their tears upon the\nwindow-panes in monotonous depressions. A labyrinth of grandeur, less\nthe property of an old family of human beings and their ghostly\nlikenesses than of an old family of echoings and thunderings which\nstart out of their hundred graves at every sound and go resounding\nthrough the building. A waste of unused passages and staircases in\nwhich to drop a comb upon a bedroom floor at night is to send a\nstealthy footfall on an errand through the house. A place where few\npeople care to go about alone, where a maid screams if an ash drops\nfrom the fire, takes to crying at all times and seasons, becomes the\nvictim of a low disorder of the spirits, and gives warning and\ndeparts.\n\nThus Chesney Wold. With so much of itself abandoned to darkness and\nvacancy; with so little change under the summer shining or the wintry\nlowering; so sombre and motionless always--no flag flying now by day,\nno rows of lights sparkling by night; with no family to come and go,\nno visitors to be the souls of pale cold shapes of rooms, no stir of\nlife about it--passion and pride, even to the stranger's eye, have\ndied away from the place in Lincolnshire and yielded it to dull\nrepose.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXVII\n\nThe Close of Esther's Narrative\n\n\nFull seven happy years I have been the mistress of Bleak House. The\nfew words that I have to add to what I have written are soon penned;\nthen I and the unknown friend to whom I write will part for ever. Not\nwithout much dear remembrance on my side. Not without some, I hope,\non his or hers.\n\nThey gave my darling into my arms, and through many weeks I never\nleft her. The little child who was to have done so much was born\nbefore the turf was planted on its father's grave. It was a boy; and\nI, my husband, and my guardian gave him his father's name.\n\nThe help that my dear counted on did come to her, though it came, in\nthe eternal wisdom, for another purpose. Though to bless and restore\nhis mother, not his father, was the errand of this baby, its power\nwas mighty to do it. When I saw the strength of the weak little hand\nand how its touch could heal my darling's heart and raised hope\nwithin her, I felt a new sense of the goodness and the tenderness of\nGod.\n\nThey throve, and by degrees I saw my dear girl pass into my country\ngarden and walk there with her infant in her arms. I was married\nthen. I was the happiest of the happy.\n\nIt was at this time that my guardian joined us and asked Ada when she\nwould come home.\n\n\"Both houses are your home, my dear,\" said he, \"but the older Bleak\nHouse claims priority. When you and my boy are strong enough to do\nit, come and take possession of your home.\"\n\nAda called him \"her dearest cousin, John.\" But he said, no, it must\nbe guardian now. He was her guardian henceforth, and the boy's; and\nhe had an old association with the name. So she called him guardian,\nand has called him guardian ever since. The children know him by no\nother name. I say the children; I have two little daughters.\n\nIt is difficult to believe that Charley (round-eyed still, and not at\nall grammatical) is married to a miller in our neighbourhood; yet so\nit is; and even now, looking up from my desk as I write early in the\nmorning at my summer window, I see the very mill beginning to go\nround. I hope the miller will not spoil Charley; but he is very fond\nof her, and Charley is rather vain of such a match, for he is well to\ndo and was in great request. So far as my small maid is concerned, I\nmight suppose time to have stood for seven years as still as the mill\ndid half an hour ago, since little Emma, Charley's sister, is exactly\nwhat Charley used to be. As to Tom, Charley's brother, I am really\nafraid to say what he did at school in ciphering, but I think it was\ndecimals. He is apprenticed to the miller, whatever it was, and is a\ngood bashful fellow, always falling in love with somebody and being\nashamed of it.\n\nCaddy Jellyby passed her very last holidays with us and was a dearer\ncreature than ever, perpetually dancing in and out of the house with\nthe children as if she had never given a dancing-lesson in her life.\nCaddy keeps her own little carriage now instead of hiring one, and\nlives full two miles further westward than Newman Street. She works\nvery hard, her husband (an excellent one) being lame and able to do\nvery little. Still, she is more than contented and does all she has\nto do with all her heart. Mr. Jellyby spends his evenings at her new\nhouse with his head against the wall as he used to do in her old one.\nI have heard that Mrs. Jellyby was understood to suffer great\nmortification from her daughter's ignoble marriage and pursuits, but\nI hope she got over it in time. She has been disappointed in\nBorrioboola-Gha, which turned out a failure in consequence of the\nking of Borrioboola wanting to sell everybody--who survived the\nclimate--for rum, but she has taken up with the rights of women to\nsit in Parliament, and Caddy tells me it is a mission involving more\ncorrespondence than the old one. I had almost forgotten Caddy's poor\nlittle girl. She is not such a mite now, but she is deaf and dumb. I\nbelieve there never was a better mother than Caddy, who learns, in\nher scanty intervals of leisure, innumerable deaf and dumb arts to\nsoften the affliction of her child.\n\nAs if I were never to have done with Caddy, I am reminded here of\nPeepy and old Mr. Turveydrop. Peepy is in the Custom House, and doing\nextremely well. Old Mr. Turveydrop, very apoplectic, still exhibits\nhis deportment about town, still enjoys himself in the old manner, is\nstill believed in in the old way. He is constant in his patronage of\nPeepy and is understood to have bequeathed him a favourite French\nclock in his dressing-room--which is not his property.\n\nWith the first money we saved at home, we added to our pretty house\nby throwing out a little growlery expressly for my guardian, which we\ninaugurated with great splendour the next time he came down to see\nus. I try to write all this lightly, because my heart is full in\ndrawing to an end, but when I write of him, my tears will have their\nway.\n\nI never look at him but I hear our poor dear Richard calling him a\ngood man. To Ada and her pretty boy, he is the fondest father; to me\nhe is what he has ever been, and what name can I give to that? He is\nmy husband's best and dearest friend, he is our children's darling,\nhe is the object of our deepest love and veneration. Yet while I feel\ntowards him as if he were a superior being, I am so familiar with him\nand so easy with him that I almost wonder at myself. I have never\nlost my old names, nor has he lost his; nor do I ever, when he is\nwith us, sit in any other place than in my old chair at his side,\nDame Trot, Dame Durden, Little Woman--all just the same as ever; and\nI answer, \"Yes, dear guardian!\" just the same.\n\nI have never known the wind to be in the east for a single moment\nsince the day when he took me to the porch to read the name. I\nremarked to him once that the wind seemed never in the east now, and\nhe said, no, truly; it had finally departed from that quarter on that\nvery day.\n\nI think my darling girl is more beautiful than ever. The sorrow that\nhas been in her face--for it is not there now--seems to have purified\neven its innocent expression and to have given it a diviner quality.\nSometimes when I raise my eyes and see her in the black dress that\nshe still wears, teaching my Richard, I feel--it is difficult to\nexpress--as if it were so good to know that she remembers her dear\nEsther in her prayers.\n\nI call him my Richard! But he says that he has two mamas, and I am\none.\n\nWe are not rich in the bank, but we have always prospered, and we\nhave quite enough. I never walk out with my husband but I hear the\npeople bless him. I never go into a house of any degree but I hear\nhis praises or see them in grateful eyes. I never lie down at night\nbut I know that in the course of that day he has alleviated pain and\nsoothed some fellow-creature in the time of need. I know that from\nthe beds of those who were past recovery, thanks have often, often\ngone up, in the last hour, for his patient ministration. Is not this\nto be rich?\n\nThe people even praise me as the doctor's wife. The people even like\nme as I go about, and make so much of me that I am quite abashed. I\nowe it all to him, my love, my pride! They like me for his sake, as I\ndo everything I do in life for his sake.\n\nA night or two ago, after bustling about preparing for my darling and\nmy guardian and little Richard, who are coming to-morrow, I was\nsitting out in the porch of all places, that dearly memorable porch,\nwhen Allan came home. So he said, \"My precious little woman, what are\nyou doing here?\" And I said, \"The moon is shining so brightly, Allan,\nand the night is so delicious, that I have been sitting here\nthinking.\"\n\n\"What have you been thinking about, my dear?\" said Allan then.\n\n\"How curious you are!\" said I. \"I am almost ashamed to tell you, but\nI will. I have been thinking about my old looks--such as they were.\"\n\n\"And what have you been thinking about THEM, my busy bee?\" said\nAllan.\n\n\"I have been thinking that I thought it was impossible that you COULD\nhave loved me any better, even if I had retained them.\"\n\n\"'Such as they were'?\" said Allan, laughing.\n\n\"Such as they were, of course.\"\n\n\"My dear Dame Durden,\" said Allan, drawing my arm through his, \"do\nyou ever look in the glass?\"\n\n\"You know I do; you see me do it.\"\n\n\"And don't you know that you are prettier than you ever were?\"\n\n\"I did not know that; I am not certain that I know it now. But I know\nthat my dearest little pets are very pretty, and that my darling is\nvery beautiful, and that my husband is very handsome, and that my\nguardian has the brightest and most benevolent face that ever was\nseen, and that they can very well do without much beauty in me--even\nsupposing--.\"", "title": "Bleak House"}
