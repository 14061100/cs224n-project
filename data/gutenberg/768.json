{"summary": "\nIn 1801 Lockwood, a wealthy man from the South of England who is seeking peace and recuperation, rents Thrushcross Grange in Yorkshire. He visits his landlord, Heathcliff, who lives in a remote moorland farmhouse, Wuthering Heights. There Lockwood finds an odd assemblage: Heathcliff seems to be a gentleman, but his manners are uncouth; the reserved mistress of the house is in her mid-teens; and a young man seems to be a member of the family, yet dresses and speaks as if he is a servant.\nSnowed in, Lockwood is grudgingly allowed to stay and is shown to a bedchamber where he notices books and graffiti left by a former inhabitant named Catherine. He falls asleep and has a nightmare in which he sees the ghostly Catherine trying to enter through the window. He cries out in fear, rousing Heathcliff, who rushes into the room. Lockwood is convinced that what he saw was real. Heathcliff, believing Lockwood to be right, examines the window and opens it, hoping to allow Catherine's spirit to enter. When nothing happens Heathcliff shows Lockwood to his own bedroom and returns to keep watch at the window.\nAt sunrise Heathcliff escorts Lockwood back to Thrushcross Grange. Lockwood asks the housekeeper, Nelly Dean, about the family at Wuthering Heights, and she tells him the tale.\n\nThirty years earlier Wuthering Heights is occupied by Mr Earnshaw, his teenage son Hindley and his daughter Catherine. On a trip to Liverpool Earnshaw encounters a homeless boy, described as a \"dark-skinned gypsy in aspect\". He adopts the boy and names him Heathcliff. Hindley feels that Heathcliff has supplanted him in his father's affections and becomes bitterly jealous. Catherine and Heathcliff become friends, and spend hours each day playing on the moors. They grow close.\nHindley is sent to college. Three years later Earnshaw dies and Hindley becomes the master of Wuthering Heights. He returns to live there with his new wife, Frances. He allows Heathcliff to stay but only as a servant.\n\nA few months after Hindley's return Heathcliff and Catherine walk to Thrushcross Grange to spy on the Lintons, who live there. After being discovered they try to run away but are caught. Catherine is injured by the Lintons' dog and taken into the house to recuperate, while Heathcliff is sent home. Catherine stays with the Lintons, and is influenced by their fine appearance and genteel manners. When she returns to Wuthering Heights her appearance and manners are more ladylike, and she laughs at Heathcliff's unkempt appearance. The next day, knowing that the Lintons are to visit, Heathcliff tries to dress up, in an effort to impress Catherine, but he and Edgar Linton get into an argument and Hindley humiliates Heathcliff by locking him in the attic. Catherine tries to comfort Heathcliff, but he vows revenge on Hindley.\nThe following year Frances Earnshaw gives birth to a son, named Hareton, but she dies a few months later. Hindley descends into drunkenness. Two more years pass, and Catherine and Edgar Linton become friends, while she becomes more distant from Heathcliff. Edgar visits Catherine while Hindley is away and they declare themselves lovers soon afterwards.\nCatherine confesses to Nelly that Edgar has proposed marriage and she has accepted, although her love for Edgar is not comparable to her love for Heathcliff, whom she cannot marry because of his low social status and lack of education. She hopes to use her position as Edgar's wife to raise Heathcliff's standing. Heathcliff overhears her say that it would \"degrade\" her to marry him (but not how much she loves him), and he runs away and disappears without a trace. Distraught over Heathcliff's departure, Catherine makes herself ill. Nelly and Edgar begin to pander to her every whim to prevent her from becoming ill again.\nThree years pass. Edgar and Catherine marry, and go to live together at Thrushcross Grange. Six months later Heathcliff returns, now a wealthy gentleman. Catherine is delighted, but Edgar is not. Edgar's sister, Isabella, soon falls in love with Heathcliff, who despises her, but encourages the infatuation as a means of revenge. One day he embraces Isabella, leading to an argument with Edgar. Upset, Catherine locks herself in her room and begins to make herself ill again.\nHeathcliff takes up residence at Wuthering Heights, and spends his time gambling with Hindley and teaching Hareton bad habits. Hindley dissipates his wealth and mortgages the farmhouse to Heathcliff to pay his debts. Heathcliff elopes with Isabella Linton. Two months later they return to Wuthering Heights. Heathcliff hears that Catherine is ill and, with Nelly's help, visits her secretly. However, Catherine is pregnant. The following day she gives birth to a daughter, Cathy, shortly before dying.\nAfter Catherine's funeral Isabella leaves Heathcliff, takes refuge in the South of England and gives birth to a son, Linton. Hindley dies six months after Catherine and Heathcliff thus finds himself master of Wuthering Heights.\n\n\nTwelve years pass. Catherine's daughter Cathy has become a beautiful, high-spirited girl. Edgar learns that his sister Isabella is dying, so he leaves to retrieve her son Linton in order to adopt and educate him. Cathy, who has rarely left home, takes advantage of her father's absence to venture further afield. She rides over the moors to Wuthering Heights and discovers that she has not one but two cousins: Hareton in addition to Linton. She also lets it be known that her father has gone to fetch Linton. When Edgar returns with Linton, a weak and sickly boy, Heathcliff insists that he live at Wuthering Heights.\nThree years pass. Walking on the moors, Nelly and Cathy encounter Heathcliff, who takes them to Wuthering Heights to see Linton and Hareton. Heathcliff hopes that Linton and Cathy will marry, so that Linton will become the heir to Thrushcross Grange. Linton and Cathy begin a secret friendship, echoing the childhood friendship between their respective parents, Heathcliff and Catherine.\nThe following year Edgar becomes very ill, taking a turn for the worse while Nelly and Cathy are out on the moors, where Heathcliff and Linton trick them into entering Wuthering Heights. Heathcliff keeps them captive to enable the marriage of Cathy and Linton to take place. After five days Nelly is released and later, with Linton's help, Cathy escapes. She returns to the Grange to see her father shortly before he dies.\nNow master of both Wuthering Heights and Thrushcross Grange, and Cathy's father-in-law, Heathcliff insists on her returning to live at Wuthering Heights. Soon after she arrives Linton dies. Hareton tries to be kind to Cathy, but she withdraws from the world.\nAt this point Nelly's tale catches up to the present day (1801). Time passes and, after being ill for a period Lockwood grows tired of the moors and informs Heathcliff that he will be leaving Thrushcross Grange.\n\nEight months later Lockwood returns to the area by chance. Given that his tenancy at Thrushcross Grange is still valid, he decides to stay there again. He finds Nelly living at Wuthering Heights and enquires what has happened since he left. She explains that she moved to Wuthering Heights to replace the housekeeper, Zillah, who had left. Hareton had an accident and was confined to the farmhouse. During his convalescence, he and Cathy overcame their mutual antipathy and became close. While their friendship developed Heathcliff began to act strangely and had visions of Catherine. He stopped eating and after four days was found dead in Catherine's old room. He was buried next to Catherine.\nLockwood learns that Hareton and Cathy plan to marry on New Year's Day. As he gets ready to leave, he passes the graves of Catherine, Edgar and Heathcliff, and pauses to contemplate the quiet of the moors.\n\n", "full_text": "Transcribed from the 1910 John Murray edition by David Price, email\nccx074@pglaf.org\n\n\n\n\n\nWUTHERING HEIGHTS\n\n\nCHAPTER I\n\n\n1801.--I have just returned from a visit to my landlord--the solitary\nneighbour that I shall be troubled with.  This is certainly a beautiful\ncountry!  In all England, I do not believe that I could have fixed on a\nsituation so completely removed from the stir of society.  A perfect\nmisanthropist's heaven: and Mr. Heathcliff and I are such a suitable pair\nto divide the desolation between us.  A capital fellow!  He little\nimagined how my heart warmed towards him when I beheld his black eyes\nwithdraw so suspiciously under their brows, as I rode up, and when his\nfingers sheltered themselves, with a jealous resolution, still further in\nhis waistcoat, as I announced my name.\n\n'Mr. Heathcliff?' I said.\n\nA nod was the answer.\n\n'Mr. Lockwood, your new tenant, sir.  I do myself the honour of calling\nas soon as possible after my arrival, to express the hope that I have not\ninconvenienced you by my perseverance in soliciting the occupation of\nThrushcross Grange: I heard yesterday you had had some thoughts--'\n\n'Thrushcross Grange is my own, sir,' he interrupted, wincing.  'I should\nnot allow any one to inconvenience me, if I could hinder it--walk in!'\n\nThe 'walk in' was uttered with closed teeth, and expressed the sentiment,\n'Go to the Deuce:' even the gate over which he leant manifested no\nsympathising movement to the words; and I think that circumstance\ndetermined me to accept the invitation: I felt interested in a man who\nseemed more exaggeratedly reserved than myself.\n\nWhen he saw my horse's breast fairly pushing the barrier, he did put out\nhis hand to unchain it, and then sullenly preceded me up the causeway,\ncalling, as we entered the court,--'Joseph, take Mr. Lockwood's horse;\nand bring up some wine.'\n\n'Here we have the whole establishment of domestics, I suppose,' was the\nreflection suggested by this compound order.  'No wonder the grass grows\nup between the flags, and cattle are the only hedge-cutters.'\n\nJoseph was an elderly, nay, an old man: very old, perhaps, though hale\nand sinewy.  'The Lord help us!' he soliloquised in an undertone of\npeevish displeasure, while relieving me of my horse: looking, meantime,\nin my face so sourly that I charitably conjectured he must have need of\ndivine aid to digest his dinner, and his pious ejaculation had no\nreference to my unexpected advent.\n\nWuthering Heights is the name of Mr. Heathcliff's dwelling.  'Wuthering'\nbeing a significant provincial adjective, descriptive of the atmospheric\ntumult to which its station is exposed in stormy weather.  Pure, bracing\nventilation they must have up there at all times, indeed: one may guess\nthe power of the north wind blowing over the edge, by the excessive slant\nof a few stunted firs at the end of the house; and by a range of gaunt\nthorns all stretching their limbs one way, as if craving alms of the sun.\nHappily, the architect had foresight to build it strong: the narrow\nwindows are deeply set in the wall, and the corners defended with large\njutting stones.\n\nBefore passing the threshold, I paused to admire a quantity of grotesque\ncarving lavished over the front, and especially about the principal door;\nabove which, among a wilderness of crumbling griffins and shameless\nlittle boys, I detected the date '1500,' and the name 'Hareton Earnshaw.'\nI would have made a few comments, and requested a short history of the\nplace from the surly owner; but his attitude at the door appeared to\ndemand my speedy entrance, or complete departure, and I had no desire to\naggravate his impatience previous to inspecting the penetralium.\n\nOne stop brought us into the family sitting-room, without any\nintroductory lobby or passage: they call it here 'the house'\npre-eminently.  It includes kitchen and parlour, generally; but I believe\nat Wuthering Heights the kitchen is forced to retreat altogether into\nanother quarter: at least I distinguished a chatter of tongues, and a\nclatter of culinary utensils, deep within; and I observed no signs of\nroasting, boiling, or baking, about the huge fireplace; nor any glitter\nof copper saucepans and tin cullenders on the walls.  One end, indeed,\nreflected splendidly both light and heat from ranks of immense pewter\ndishes, interspersed with silver jugs and tankards, towering row after\nrow, on a vast oak dresser, to the very roof.  The latter had never been\nunder-drawn: its entire anatomy lay bare to an inquiring eye, except\nwhere a frame of wood laden with oatcakes and clusters of legs of beef,\nmutton, and ham, concealed it.  Above the chimney were sundry villainous\nold guns, and a couple of horse-pistols: and, by way of ornament, three\ngaudily-painted canisters disposed along its ledge.  The floor was of\nsmooth, white stone; the chairs, high-backed, primitive structures,\npainted green: one or two heavy black ones lurking in the shade.  In an\narch under the dresser reposed a huge, liver-coloured bitch pointer,\nsurrounded by a swarm of squealing puppies; and other dogs haunted other\nrecesses.\n\nThe apartment and furniture would have been nothing extraordinary as\nbelonging to a homely, northern farmer, with a stubborn countenance, and\nstalwart limbs set out to advantage in knee-breeches and gaiters.  Such\nan individual seated in his arm-chair, his mug of ale frothing on the\nround table before him, is to be seen in any circuit of five or six miles\namong these hills, if you go at the right time after dinner.  But Mr.\nHeathcliff forms a singular contrast to his abode and style of living.  He\nis a dark-skinned gipsy in aspect, in dress and manners a gentleman: that\nis, as much a gentleman as many a country squire: rather slovenly,\nperhaps, yet not looking amiss with his negligence, because he has an\nerect and handsome figure; and rather morose.  Possibly, some people\nmight suspect him of a degree of under-bred pride; I have a sympathetic\nchord within that tells me it is nothing of the sort: I know, by\ninstinct, his reserve springs from an aversion to showy displays of\nfeeling--to manifestations of mutual kindliness.  He'll love and hate\nequally under cover, and esteem it a species of impertinence to be loved\nor hated again.  No, I'm running on too fast: I bestow my own attributes\nover-liberally on him.  Mr. Heathcliff may have entirely dissimilar\nreasons for keeping his hand out of the way when he meets a would-be\nacquaintance, to those which actuate me.  Let me hope my constitution is\nalmost peculiar: my dear mother used to say I should never have a\ncomfortable home; and only last summer I proved myself perfectly unworthy\nof one.\n\nWhile enjoying a month of fine weather at the sea-coast, I was thrown\ninto the company of a most fascinating creature: a real goddess in my\neyes, as long as she took no notice of me.  I 'never told my love'\nvocally; still, if looks have language, the merest idiot might have\nguessed I was over head and ears: she understood me at last, and looked a\nreturn--the sweetest of all imaginable looks.  And what did I do?  I\nconfess it with shame--shrunk icily into myself, like a snail; at every\nglance retired colder and farther; till finally the poor innocent was led\nto doubt her own senses, and, overwhelmed with confusion at her supposed\nmistake, persuaded her mamma to decamp.  By this curious turn of\ndisposition I have gained the reputation of deliberate heartlessness; how\nundeserved, I alone can appreciate.\n\nI took a seat at the end of the hearthstone opposite that towards which\nmy landlord advanced, and filled up an interval of silence by attempting\nto caress the canine mother, who had left her nursery, and was sneaking\nwolfishly to the back of my legs, her lip curled up, and her white teeth\nwatering for a snatch.  My caress provoked a long, guttural gnarl.\n\n'You'd better let the dog alone,' growled Mr. Heathcliff in unison,\nchecking fiercer demonstrations with a punch of his foot.  'She's not\naccustomed to be spoiled--not kept for a pet.'  Then, striding to a side\ndoor, he shouted again, 'Joseph!'\n\nJoseph mumbled indistinctly in the depths of the cellar, but gave no\nintimation of ascending; so his master dived down to him, leaving me\n_vis-a-vis_ the ruffianly bitch and a pair of grim shaggy sheep-dogs,\nwho shared with her a jealous guardianship over all my movements. Not\nanxious to come in contact with their fangs, I sat still; but, imagining\nthey would scarcely understand tacit insults, I unfortunately indulged\nin winking and making faces at the trio, and some turn of my physiognomy\nso irritated madam, that she suddenly broke into a fury and leapt on my\nknees. I flung her back, and hastened to interpose the table between us.\nThis proceeding aroused the whole hive: half-a-dozen four-footed fiends,\nof various sizes and ages, issued from hidden dens to the common centre.\nI felt my heels and coat-laps peculiar subjects of assault; and parrying\noff the larger combatants as effectually as I could with the poker, I\nwas constrained to demand, aloud, assistance from some of the household\nin re-establishing peace.\n\nMr. Heathcliff and his man climbed the cellar steps with vexatious\nphlegm: I don't think they moved one second faster than usual, though\nthe hearth was an absolute tempest of worrying and yelping. Happily, an\ninhabitant of the kitchen made more despatch: a lusty dame, with\ntucked-up gown, bare arms, and fire-flushed cheeks, rushed into the\nmidst of us flourishing a frying-pan: and used that weapon, and her\ntongue, to such purpose, that the storm subsided magically, and she only\nremained, heaving like a sea after a high wind, when her master entered\non the scene.\n\n'What the devil is the matter?' he asked, eyeing me in a manner that I\ncould ill endure, after this inhospitable treatment.\n\n'What the devil, indeed!' I muttered.  'The herd of possessed swine could\nhave had no worse spirits in them than those animals of yours, sir.  You\nmight as well leave a stranger with a brood of tigers!'\n\n'They won't meddle with persons who touch nothing,' he remarked, putting\nthe bottle before me, and restoring the displaced table.  'The dogs do\nright to be vigilant.  Take a glass of wine?'\n\n'No, thank you.'\n\n'Not bitten, are you?'\n\n'If I had been, I would have set my signet on the biter.'  Heathcliff's\ncountenance relaxed into a grin.\n\n'Come, come,' he said, 'you are flurried, Mr. Lockwood.  Here, take a\nlittle wine.  Guests are so exceedingly rare in this house that I and my\ndogs, I am willing to own, hardly know how to receive them.  Your health,\nsir?'\n\nI bowed and returned the pledge; beginning to perceive that it would be\nfoolish to sit sulking for the misbehaviour of a pack of curs; besides, I\nfelt loth to yield the fellow further amusement at my expense; since his\nhumour took that turn.  He--probably swayed by prudential consideration\nof the folly of offending a good tenant--relaxed a little in the laconic\nstyle of chipping off his pronouns and auxiliary verbs, and introduced\nwhat he supposed would be a subject of interest to me,--a discourse on\nthe advantages and disadvantages of my present place of retirement.  I\nfound him very intelligent on the topics we touched; and before I went\nhome, I was encouraged so far as to volunteer another visit to-morrow.  He\nevidently wished no repetition of my intrusion.  I shall go,\nnotwithstanding.  It is astonishing how sociable I feel myself compared\nwith him.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II\n\n\nYesterday afternoon set in misty and cold.  I had half a mind to spend it\nby my study fire, instead of wading through heath and mud to Wuthering\nHeights.  On coming up from dinner, however, (N.B.--I dine between twelve\nand one o'clock; the housekeeper, a matronly lady, taken as a fixture\nalong with the house, could not, or would not, comprehend my request that\nI might be served at five)--on mounting the stairs with this lazy\nintention, and stepping into the room, I saw a servant-girl on her knees\nsurrounded by brushes and coal-scuttles, and raising an infernal dust as\nshe extinguished the flames with heaps of cinders.  This spectacle drove\nme back immediately; I took my hat, and, after a four-miles' walk,\narrived at Heathcliff's garden-gate just in time to escape the first\nfeathery flakes of a snow-shower.\n\nOn that bleak hill-top the earth was hard with a black frost, and the air\nmade me shiver through every limb.  Being unable to remove the chain, I\njumped over, and, running up the flagged causeway bordered with\nstraggling gooseberry-bushes, knocked vainly for admittance, till my\nknuckles tingled and the dogs howled.\n\n'Wretched inmates!' I ejaculated, mentally, 'you deserve perpetual\nisolation from your species for your churlish inhospitality. At least, I\nwould not keep my doors barred in the day-time. I don't care--I will get\nin!' So resolved, I grasped the latch and shook it vehemently.\nVinegar-faced Joseph projected his head from a round window of the barn.\n\n'What are ye for?' he shouted.  'T' maister's down i' t' fowld.  Go round\nby th' end o' t' laith, if ye went to spake to him.'\n\n'Is there nobody inside to open the door?' I hallooed, responsively.\n\n'There's nobbut t' missis; and shoo'll not oppen 't an ye mak' yer\nflaysome dins till neeght.'\n\n'Why?  Cannot you tell her whom I am, eh, Joseph?'\n\n'Nor-ne me!  I'll hae no hend wi't,' muttered the head, vanishing.\n\nThe snow began to drive thickly.  I seized the handle to essay another\ntrial; when a young man without coat, and shouldering a pitchfork,\nappeared in the yard behind.  He hailed me to follow him, and, after\nmarching through a wash-house, and a paved area containing a coal-shed,\npump, and pigeon-cot, we at length arrived in the huge, warm, cheerful\napartment where I was formerly received.  It glowed delightfully in the\nradiance of an immense fire, compounded of coal, peat, and wood; and near\nthe table, laid for a plentiful evening meal, I was pleased to observe\nthe 'missis,' an individual whose existence I had never previously\nsuspected.  I bowed and waited, thinking she would bid me take a seat.\nShe looked at me, leaning back in her chair, and remained motionless and\nmute.\n\n'Rough weather!' I remarked.  'I'm afraid, Mrs. Heathcliff, the door must\nbear the consequence of your servants' leisure attendance: I had hard\nwork to make them hear me.'\n\nShe never opened her mouth.  I stared--she stared also: at any rate, she\nkept her eyes on me in a cool, regardless manner, exceedingly\nembarrassing and disagreeable.\n\n'Sit down,' said the young man, gruffly.  'He'll be in soon.'\n\nI obeyed; and hemmed, and called the villain Juno, who deigned, at this\nsecond interview, to move the extreme tip of her tail, in token of owning\nmy acquaintance.\n\n'A beautiful animal!' I commenced again.  'Do you intend parting with the\nlittle ones, madam?'\n\n'They are not mine,' said the amiable hostess, more repellingly than\nHeathcliff himself could have replied.\n\n'Ah, your favourites are among these?' I continued, turning to an obscure\ncushion full of something like cats.\n\n'A strange choice of favourites!' she observed scornfully.\n\nUnluckily, it was a heap of dead rabbits.  I hemmed once more, and drew\ncloser to the hearth, repeating my comment on the wildness of the\nevening.\n\n'You should not have come out,' she said, rising and reaching from the\nchimney-piece two of the painted canisters.\n\nHer position before was sheltered from the light; now, I had a distinct\nview of her whole figure and countenance.  She was slender, and\napparently scarcely past girlhood: an admirable form, and the most\nexquisite little face that I have ever had the pleasure of beholding;\nsmall features, very fair; flaxen ringlets, or rather golden, hanging\nloose on her delicate neck; and eyes, had they been agreeable in\nexpression, that would have been irresistible: fortunately for my\nsusceptible heart, the only sentiment they evinced hovered between scorn\nand a kind of desperation, singularly unnatural to be detected there.  The\ncanisters were almost out of her reach; I made a motion to aid her; she\nturned upon me as a miser might turn if any one attempted to assist him\nin counting his gold.\n\n'I don't want your help,' she snapped; 'I can get them for myself.'\n\n'I beg your pardon!' I hastened to reply.\n\n'Were you asked to tea?' she demanded, tying an apron over her neat black\nfrock, and standing with a spoonful of the leaf poised over the pot.\n\n'I shall be glad to have a cup,' I answered.\n\n'Were you asked?' she repeated.\n\n'No,' I said, half smiling.  'You are the proper person to ask me.'\n\nShe flung the tea back, spoon and all, and resumed her chair in a pet;\nher forehead corrugated, and her red under-lip pushed out, like a child's\nready to cry.\n\nMeanwhile, the young man had slung on to his person a decidedly shabby\nupper garment, and, erecting himself before the blaze, looked down on me\nfrom the corner of his eyes, for all the world as if there were some\nmortal feud unavenged between us.  I began to doubt whether he were a\nservant or not: his dress and speech were both rude, entirely devoid of\nthe superiority observable in Mr. and Mrs. Heathcliff; his thick brown\ncurls were rough and uncultivated, his whiskers encroached bearishly over\nhis cheeks, and his hands were embrowned like those of a common labourer:\nstill his bearing was free, almost haughty, and he showed none of a\ndomestic's assiduity in attending on the lady of the house.  In the\nabsence of clear proofs of his condition, I deemed it best to abstain\nfrom noticing his curious conduct; and, five minutes afterwards, the\nentrance of Heathcliff relieved me, in some measure, from my\nuncomfortable state.\n\n'You see, sir, I am come, according to promise!' I exclaimed, assuming\nthe cheerful; 'and I fear I shall be weather-bound for half an hour, if\nyou can afford me shelter during that space.'\n\n'Half an hour?' he said, shaking the white flakes from his clothes; 'I\nwonder you should select the thick of a snow-storm to ramble about in.  Do\nyou know that you run a risk of being lost in the marshes?  People\nfamiliar with these moors often miss their road on such evenings; and I\ncan tell you there is no chance of a change at present.'\n\n'Perhaps I can get a guide among your lads, and he might stay at the\nGrange till morning--could you spare me one?'\n\n'No, I could not.'\n\n'Oh, indeed!  Well, then, I must trust to my own sagacity.'\n\n'Umph!'\n\n'Are you going to mak' the tea?' demanded he of the shabby coat, shifting\nhis ferocious gaze from me to the young lady.\n\n'Is _he_ to have any?' she asked, appealing to Heathcliff.\n\n'Get it ready, will you?' was the answer, uttered so savagely that I\nstarted.  The tone in which the words were said revealed a genuine bad\nnature.  I no longer felt inclined to call Heathcliff a capital fellow.\nWhen the preparations were finished, he invited me with--'Now, sir, bring\nforward your chair.'  And we all, including the rustic youth, drew round\nthe table: an austere silence prevailing while we discussed our meal.\n\nI thought, if I had caused the cloud, it was my duty to make an effort to\ndispel it.  They could not every day sit so grim and taciturn; and it was\nimpossible, however ill-tempered they might be, that the universal scowl\nthey wore was their every-day countenance.\n\n'It is strange,' I began, in the interval of swallowing one cup of tea\nand receiving another--'it is strange how custom can mould our tastes and\nideas: many could not imagine the existence of happiness in a life of\nsuch complete exile from the world as you spend, Mr. Heathcliff; yet,\nI'll venture to say, that, surrounded by your family, and with your\namiable lady as the presiding genius over your home and heart--'\n\n'My amiable lady!' he interrupted, with an almost diabolical sneer on his\nface.  'Where is she--my amiable lady?'\n\n'Mrs. Heathcliff, your wife, I mean.'\n\n'Well, yes--oh, you would intimate that her spirit has taken the post of\nministering angel, and guards the fortunes of Wuthering Heights, even\nwhen her body is gone.  Is that it?'\n\nPerceiving myself in a blunder, I attempted to correct it.  I might have\nseen there was too great a disparity between the ages of the parties to\nmake it likely that they were man and wife.  One was about forty: a\nperiod of mental vigour at which men seldom cherish the delusion of being\nmarried for love by girls: that dream is reserved for the solace of our\ndeclining years.  The other did not look seventeen.\n\nThen it flashed upon me--'The clown at my elbow, who is drinking his tea\nout of a basin and eating his bread with unwashed hands, may be her\nhusband: Heathcliff junior, of course.  Here is the consequence of being\nburied alive: she has thrown herself away upon that boor from sheer\nignorance that better individuals existed!  A sad pity--I must beware how\nI cause her to regret her choice.'  The last reflection may seem\nconceited; it was not.  My neighbour struck me as bordering on repulsive;\nI knew, through experience, that I was tolerably attractive.\n\n'Mrs. Heathcliff is my daughter-in-law,' said Heathcliff, corroborating\nmy surmise.  He turned, as he spoke, a peculiar look in her direction: a\nlook of hatred; unless he has a most perverse set of facial muscles that\nwill not, like those of other people, interpret the language of his soul.\n\n'Ah, certainly--I see now: you are the favoured possessor of the\nbeneficent fairy,' I remarked, turning to my neighbour.\n\nThis was worse than before: the youth grew crimson, and clenched his\nfist, with every appearance of a meditated assault.  But he seemed to\nrecollect himself presently, and smothered the storm in a brutal curse,\nmuttered on my behalf: which, however, I took care not to notice.\n\n'Unhappy in your conjectures, sir,' observed my host; 'we neither of us\nhave the privilege of owning your good fairy; her mate is dead.  I said\nshe was my daughter-in-law: therefore, she must have married my son.'\n\n'And this young man is--'\n\n'Not my son, assuredly.'\n\nHeathcliff smiled again, as if it were rather too bold a jest to\nattribute the paternity of that bear to him.\n\n'My name is Hareton Earnshaw,' growled the other; 'and I'd counsel you to\nrespect it!'\n\n'I've shown no disrespect,' was my reply, laughing internally at the\ndignity with which he announced himself.\n\nHe fixed his eye on me longer than I cared to return the stare, for fear\nI might be tempted either to box his ears or render my hilarity audible.\nI began to feel unmistakably out of place in that pleasant family circle.\nThe dismal spiritual atmosphere overcame, and more than neutralised, the\nglowing physical comforts round me; and I resolved to be cautious how I\nventured under those rafters a third time.\n\nThe business of eating being concluded, and no one uttering a word of\nsociable conversation, I approached a window to examine the weather.  A\nsorrowful sight I saw: dark night coming down prematurely, and sky and\nhills mingled in one bitter whirl of wind and suffocating snow.\n\n'I don't think it possible for me to get home now without a guide,' I\ncould not help exclaiming.  'The roads will be buried already; and, if\nthey were bare, I could scarcely distinguish a foot in advance.'\n\n'Hareton, drive those dozen sheep into the barn porch.  They'll be\ncovered if left in the fold all night: and put a plank before them,' said\nHeathcliff.\n\n'How must I do?' I continued, with rising irritation.\n\nThere was no reply to my question; and on looking round I saw only Joseph\nbringing in a pail of porridge for the dogs, and Mrs. Heathcliff leaning\nover the fire, diverting herself with burning a bundle of matches which\nhad fallen from the chimney-piece as she restored the tea-canister to its\nplace.  The former, when he had deposited his burden, took a critical\nsurvey of the room, and in cracked tones grated out--'Aw wonder how yah\ncan faishion to stand thear i' idleness un war, when all on 'ems goan\nout!  Bud yah're a nowt, and it's no use talking--yah'll niver mend o'yer\nill ways, but goa raight to t' divil, like yer mother afore ye!'\n\nI imagined, for a moment, that this piece of eloquence was addressed to\nme; and, sufficiently enraged, stepped towards the aged rascal with an\nintention of kicking him out of the door.  Mrs. Heathcliff, however,\nchecked me by her answer.\n\n'You scandalous old hypocrite!' she replied.  'Are you not afraid of\nbeing carried away bodily, whenever you mention the devil's name?  I warn\nyou to refrain from provoking me, or I'll ask your abduction as a special\nfavour!  Stop! look here, Joseph,' she continued, taking a long, dark\nbook from a shelf; 'I'll show you how far I've progressed in the Black\nArt: I shall soon be competent to make a clear house of it.  The red cow\ndidn't die by chance; and your rheumatism can hardly be reckoned among\nprovidential visitations!'\n\n'Oh, wicked, wicked!' gasped the elder; 'may the Lord deliver us from\nevil!'\n\n'No, reprobate! you are a castaway--be off, or I'll hurt you seriously!\nI'll have you all modelled in wax and clay! and the first who passes the\nlimits I fix shall--I'll not say what he shall be done to--but, you'll\nsee!  Go, I'm looking at you!'\n\nThe little witch put a mock malignity into her beautiful eyes, and\nJoseph, trembling with sincere horror, hurried out, praying, and\nejaculating 'wicked' as he went.  I thought her conduct must be prompted\nby a species of dreary fun; and, now that we were alone, I endeavoured to\ninterest her in my distress.\n\n'Mrs. Heathcliff,' I said earnestly, 'you must excuse me for troubling\nyou.  I presume, because, with that face, I'm sure you cannot help being\ngood-hearted.  Do point out some landmarks by which I may know my way\nhome: I have no more idea how to get there than you would have how to get\nto London!'\n\n'Take the road you came,' she answered, ensconcing herself in a chair,\nwith a candle, and the long book open before her.  'It is brief advice,\nbut as sound as I can give.'\n\n'Then, if you hear of me being discovered dead in a bog or a pit full of\nsnow, your conscience won't whisper that it is partly your fault?'\n\n'How so?  I cannot escort you.  They wouldn't let me go to the end of the\ngarden wall.'\n\n'_You_!  I should be sorry to ask you to cross the threshold, for my\nconvenience, on such a night,' I cried.  'I want you to tell me my way,\nnot to _show_ it: or else to persuade Mr. Heathcliff to give me a guide.'\n\n'Who?  There is himself, Earnshaw, Zillah, Joseph and I.  Which would you\nhave?'\n\n'Are there no boys at the farm?'\n\n'No; those are all.'\n\n'Then, it follows that I am compelled to stay.'\n\n'That you may settle with your host.  I have nothing to do with it.'\n\n'I hope it will be a lesson to you to make no more rash journeys on these\nhills,' cried Heathcliff's stern voice from the kitchen entrance.  'As to\nstaying here, I don't keep accommodations for visitors: you must share a\nbed with Hareton or Joseph, if you do.'\n\n'I can sleep on a chair in this room,' I replied.\n\n'No, no!  A stranger is a stranger, be he rich or poor: it will not suit\nme to permit any one the range of the place while I am off guard!' said\nthe unmannerly wretch.\n\nWith this insult my patience was at an end.  I uttered an expression of\ndisgust, and pushed past him into the yard, running against Earnshaw in\nmy haste.  It was so dark that I could not see the means of exit; and, as\nI wandered round, I heard another specimen of their civil behaviour\namongst each other.  At first the young man appeared about to befriend\nme.\n\n'I'll go with him as far as the park,' he said.\n\n'You'll go with him to hell!' exclaimed his master, or whatever relation\nhe bore.  'And who is to look after the horses, eh?'\n\n'A man's life is of more consequence than one evening's neglect of the\nhorses: somebody must go,' murmured Mrs. Heathcliff, more kindly than I\nexpected.\n\n'Not at your command!' retorted Hareton.  'If you set store on him, you'd\nbetter be quiet.'\n\n'Then I hope his ghost will haunt you; and I hope Mr. Heathcliff will\nnever get another tenant till the Grange is a ruin,' she answered,\nsharply.\n\n'Hearken, hearken, shoo's cursing on 'em!' muttered Joseph, towards whom\nI had been steering.\n\nHe sat within earshot, milking the cows by the light of a lantern, which\nI seized unceremoniously, and, calling out that I would send it back on\nthe morrow, rushed to the nearest postern.\n\n'Maister, maister, he's staling t' lanthern!' shouted the ancient,\npursuing my retreat.  'Hey, Gnasher!  Hey, dog!  Hey Wolf, holld him,\nholld him!'\n\nOn opening the little door, two hairy monsters flew at my throat, bearing\nme down, and extinguishing the light; while a mingled guffaw from\nHeathcliff and Hareton put the copestone on my rage and humiliation.\nFortunately, the beasts seemed more bent on stretching their paws, and\nyawning, and flourishing their tails, than devouring me alive; but they\nwould suffer no resurrection, and I was forced to lie till their\nmalignant masters pleased to deliver me: then, hatless and trembling with\nwrath, I ordered the miscreants to let me out--on their peril to keep me\none minute longer--with several incoherent threats of retaliation that,\nin their indefinite depth of virulency, smacked of King Lear.\n\nThe vehemence of my agitation brought on a copious bleeding at the nose,\nand still Heathcliff laughed, and still I scolded.  I don't know what\nwould have concluded the scene, had there not been one person at hand\nrather more rational than myself, and more benevolent than my\nentertainer.  This was Zillah, the stout housewife; who at length issued\nforth to inquire into the nature of the uproar.  She thought that some of\nthem had been laying violent hands on me; and, not daring to attack her\nmaster, she turned her vocal artillery against the younger scoundrel.\n\n'Well, Mr. Earnshaw,' she cried, 'I wonder what you'll have agait next?\nAre we going to murder folk on our very door-stones?  I see this house\nwill never do for me--look at t' poor lad, he's fair choking!  Wisht,\nwisht; you mun'n't go on so.  Come in, and I'll cure that: there now,\nhold ye still.'\n\nWith these words she suddenly splashed a pint of icy water down my neck,\nand pulled me into the kitchen.  Mr. Heathcliff followed, his accidental\nmerriment expiring quickly in his habitual moroseness.\n\nI was sick exceedingly, and dizzy, and faint; and thus compelled perforce\nto accept lodgings under his roof.  He told Zillah to give me a glass of\nbrandy, and then passed on to the inner room; while she condoled with me\non my sorry predicament, and having obeyed his orders, whereby I was\nsomewhat revived, ushered me to bed.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III\n\n\nWhile leading the way upstairs, she recommended that I should hide the\ncandle, and not make a noise; for her master had an odd notion about the\nchamber she would put me in, and never let anybody lodge there willingly.\nI asked the reason.  She did not know, she answered: she had only lived\nthere a year or two; and they had so many queer goings on, she could not\nbegin to be curious.\n\nToo stupefied to be curious myself, I fastened my door and glanced round\nfor the bed.  The whole furniture consisted of a chair, a clothes-press,\nand a large oak case, with squares cut out near the top resembling coach\nwindows.  Having approached this structure, I looked inside, and\nperceived it to be a singular sort of old-fashioned couch, very\nconveniently designed to obviate the necessity for every member of the\nfamily having a room to himself.  In fact, it formed a little closet, and\nthe ledge of a window, which it enclosed, served as a table.  I slid back\nthe panelled sides, got in with my light, pulled them together again, and\nfelt secure against the vigilance of Heathcliff, and every one else.\n\nThe ledge, where I placed my candle, had a few mildewed books piled up in\none corner; and it was covered with writing scratched on the paint.  This\nwriting, however, was nothing but a name repeated in all kinds of\ncharacters, large and small--_Catherine Earnshaw_, here and there varied\nto _Catherine Heathcliff_, and then again to _Catherine Linton_.\n\nIn vapid listlessness I leant my head against the window, and continued\nspelling over Catherine Earnshaw--Heathcliff--Linton, till my eyes\nclosed; but they had not rested five minutes when a glare of white\nletters started from the dark, as vivid as spectres--the air swarmed with\nCatherines; and rousing myself to dispel the obtrusive name, I discovered\nmy candle-wick reclining on one of the antique volumes, and perfuming the\nplace with an odour of roasted calf-skin.  I snuffed it off, and, very\nill at ease under the influence of cold and lingering nausea, sat up and\nspread open the injured tome on my knee.  It was a Testament, in lean\ntype, and smelling dreadfully musty: a fly-leaf bore the\ninscription--'Catherine Earnshaw, her book,' and a date some quarter of a\ncentury back.  I shut it, and took up another and another, till I had\nexamined all.  Catherine's library was select, and its state of\ndilapidation proved it to have been well used, though not altogether for\na legitimate purpose: scarcely one chapter had escaped, a pen-and-ink\ncommentary--at least the appearance of one--covering every morsel of\nblank that the printer had left.  Some were detached sentences; other\nparts took the form of a regular diary, scrawled in an unformed, childish\nhand.  At the top of an extra page (quite a treasure, probably, when\nfirst lighted on) I was greatly amused to behold an excellent caricature\nof my friend Joseph,--rudely, yet powerfully sketched.  An immediate\ninterest kindled within me for the unknown Catherine, and I began\nforthwith to decipher her faded hieroglyphics.\n\n'An awful Sunday,' commenced the paragraph beneath.  'I wish my father\nwere back again.  Hindley is a detestable substitute--his conduct to\nHeathcliff is atrocious--H. and I are going to rebel--we took our\ninitiatory step this evening.\n\n'All day had been flooding with rain; we could not go to church, so\nJoseph must needs get up a congregation in the garret; and, while Hindley\nand his wife basked downstairs before a comfortable fire--doing anything\nbut reading their Bibles, I'll answer for it--Heathcliff, myself, and the\nunhappy ploughboy were commanded to take our prayer-books, and mount: we\nwere ranged in a row, on a sack of corn, groaning and shivering, and\nhoping that Joseph would shiver too, so that he might give us a short\nhomily for his own sake.  A vain idea!  The service lasted precisely\nthree hours; and yet my brother had the face to exclaim, when he saw us\ndescending, \"What, done already?\"  On Sunday evenings we used to be\npermitted to play, if we did not make much noise; now a mere titter is\nsufficient to send us into corners.\n\n'\"You forget you have a master here,\" says the tyrant.  \"I'll demolish\nthe first who puts me out of temper!  I insist on perfect sobriety and\nsilence.  Oh, boy! was that you?  Frances darling, pull his hair as you\ngo by: I heard him snap his fingers.\"  Frances pulled his hair heartily,\nand then went and seated herself on her husband's knee, and there they\nwere, like two babies, kissing and talking nonsense by the hour--foolish\npalaver that we should be ashamed of.  We made ourselves as snug as our\nmeans allowed in the arch of the dresser.  I had just fastened our\npinafores together, and hung them up for a curtain, when in comes Joseph,\non an errand from the stables.  He tears down my handiwork, boxes my\nears, and croaks:\n\n'\"T' maister nobbut just buried, and Sabbath not o'ered, und t' sound o'\nt' gospel still i' yer lugs, and ye darr be laiking!  Shame on ye! sit ye\ndown, ill childer! there's good books eneugh if ye'll read 'em: sit ye\ndown, and think o' yer sowls!\"\n\n'Saying this, he compelled us so to square our positions that we might\nreceive from the far-off fire a dull ray to show us the text of the\nlumber he thrust upon us.  I could not bear the employment.  I took my\ndingy volume by the scroop, and hurled it into the dog-kennel, vowing I\nhated a good book.  Heathcliff kicked his to the same place.  Then there\nwas a hubbub!\n\n'\"Maister Hindley!\" shouted our chaplain.  \"Maister, coom hither!  Miss\nCathy's riven th' back off 'Th' Helmet o' Salvation,' un' Heathcliff's\npawsed his fit into t' first part o' 'T' Brooad Way to Destruction!'  It's\nfair flaysome that ye let 'em go on this gait.  Ech! th' owd man wad ha'\nlaced 'em properly--but he's goan!\"\n\n'Hindley hurried up from his paradise on the hearth, and seizing one of\nus by the collar, and the other by the arm, hurled both into the\nback-kitchen; where, Joseph asseverated, \"owd Nick\" would fetch us as\nsure as we were living: and, so comforted, we each sought a separate\nnook to await his advent. I reached this book, and a pot of ink from a\nshelf, and pushed the house-door ajar to give me light, and I have got\nthe time on with writing for twenty minutes; but my companion is\nimpatient, and proposes that we should appropriate the dairywoman's\ncloak, and have a scamper on the moors, under its shelter. A pleasant\nsuggestion--and then, if the surly old man come in, he may believe his\nprophecy verified--we cannot be damper, or colder, in the rain than we\nare here.'\n\n* * * * * *\n\nI suppose Catherine fulfilled her project, for the next sentence took up\nanother subject: she waxed lachrymose.\n\n'How little did I dream that Hindley would ever make me cry so!' she\nwrote.  'My head aches, till I cannot keep it on the pillow; and still I\ncan't give over.  Poor Heathcliff!  Hindley calls him a vagabond, and\nwon't let him sit with us, nor eat with us any more; and, he says, he and\nI must not play together, and threatens to turn him out of the house if\nwe break his orders.  He has been blaming our father (how dared he?) for\ntreating H. too liberally; and swears he will reduce him to his right\nplace--'\n\n* * * * * *\n\nI began to nod drowsily over the dim page: my eye wandered from\nmanuscript to print.  I saw a red ornamented title--'Seventy Times Seven,\nand the First of the Seventy-First.  A Pious Discourse delivered by the\nReverend Jabez Branderham, in the Chapel of Gimmerden Sough.'  And while\nI was, half-consciously, worrying my brain to guess what Jabez Branderham\nwould make of his subject, I sank back in bed, and fell asleep.  Alas,\nfor the effects of bad tea and bad temper!  What else could it be that\nmade me pass such a terrible night?  I don't remember another that I can\nat all compare with it since I was capable of suffering.\n\nI began to dream, almost before I ceased to be sensible of my locality.  I\nthought it was morning; and I had set out on my way home, with Joseph for\na guide.  The snow lay yards deep in our road; and, as we floundered on,\nmy companion wearied me with constant reproaches that I had not brought a\npilgrim's staff: telling me that I could never get into the house without\none, and boastfully flourishing a heavy-headed cudgel, which I understood\nto be so denominated.  For a moment I considered it absurd that I should\nneed such a weapon to gain admittance into my own residence.  Then a new\nidea flashed across me.  I was not going there: we were journeying to\nhear the famous Jabez Branderham preach, from the text--'Seventy Times\nSeven;' and either Joseph, the preacher, or I had committed the 'First of\nthe Seventy-First,' and were to be publicly exposed and excommunicated.\n\nWe came to the chapel.  I have passed it really in my walks, twice or\nthrice; it lies in a hollow, between two hills: an elevated hollow, near\na swamp, whose peaty moisture is said to answer all the purposes of\nembalming on the few corpses deposited there.  The roof has been kept\nwhole hitherto; but as the clergyman's stipend is only twenty pounds per\nannum, and a house with two rooms, threatening speedily to determine into\none, no clergyman will undertake the duties of pastor: especially as it\nis currently reported that his flock would rather let him starve than\nincrease the living by one penny from their own pockets.  However, in my\ndream, Jabez had a full and attentive congregation; and he preached--good\nGod! what a sermon; divided into _four hundred and ninety_ parts, each\nfully equal to an ordinary address from the pulpit, and each discussing a\nseparate sin!  Where he searched for them, I cannot tell.  He had his\nprivate manner of interpreting the phrase, and it seemed necessary the\nbrother should sin different sins on every occasion.  They were of the\nmost curious character: odd transgressions that I never imagined\npreviously.\n\nOh, how weary I grow.  How I writhed, and yawned, and nodded, and\nrevived!  How I pinched and pricked myself, and rubbed my eyes, and stood\nup, and sat down again, and nudged Joseph to inform me if he would _ever_\nhave done.  I was condemned to hear all out: finally, he reached the\n'_First of the Seventy-First_.'  At that crisis, a sudden inspiration\ndescended on me; I was moved to rise and denounce Jabez Branderham as the\nsinner of the sin that no Christian need pardon.\n\n'Sir,' I exclaimed, 'sitting here within these four walls, at one\nstretch, I have endured and forgiven the four hundred and ninety heads of\nyour discourse.  Seventy times seven times have I plucked up my hat and\nbeen about to depart--Seventy times seven times have you preposterously\nforced me to resume my seat.  The four hundred and ninety-first is too\nmuch.  Fellow-martyrs, have at him!  Drag him down, and crush him to\natoms, that the place which knows him may know him no more!'\n\n'_Thou art the Man_!' cried Jabez, after a solemn pause, leaning over his\ncushion.  'Seventy times seven times didst thou gapingly contort thy\nvisage--seventy times seven did I take counsel with my soul--Lo, this is\nhuman weakness: this also may be absolved!  The First of the\nSeventy-First is come.  Brethren, execute upon him the judgment written.\nSuch honour have all His saints!'\n\nWith that concluding word, the whole assembly, exalting their pilgrim's\nstaves, rushed round me in a body; and I, having no weapon to raise in\nself-defence, commenced grappling with Joseph, my nearest and most\nferocious assailant, for his.  In the confluence of the multitude,\nseveral clubs crossed; blows, aimed at me, fell on other sconces.\nPresently the whole chapel resounded with rappings and counter rappings:\nevery man's hand was against his neighbour; and Branderham, unwilling to\nremain idle, poured forth his zeal in a shower of loud taps on the boards\nof the pulpit, which responded so smartly that, at last, to my\nunspeakable relief, they woke me.  And what was it that had suggested the\ntremendous tumult?  What had played Jabez's part in the row?  Merely the\nbranch of a fir-tree that touched my lattice as the blast wailed by, and\nrattled its dry cones against the panes!  I listened doubtingly an\ninstant; detected the disturber, then turned and dozed, and dreamt again:\nif possible, still more disagreeably than before.\n\nThis time, I remembered I was lying in the oak closet, and I heard\ndistinctly the gusty wind, and the driving of the snow; I heard, also,\nthe fir bough repeat its teasing sound, and ascribed it to the right\ncause: but it annoyed me so much, that I resolved to silence it, if\npossible; and, I thought, I rose and endeavoured to unhasp the casement.\nThe hook was soldered into the staple: a circumstance observed by me when\nawake, but forgotten.  'I must stop it, nevertheless!' I muttered,\nknocking my knuckles through the glass, and stretching an arm out to\nseize the importunate branch; instead of which, my fingers closed on the\nfingers of a little, ice-cold hand!  The intense horror of nightmare came\nover me: I tried to draw back my arm, but the hand clung to it, and a\nmost melancholy voice sobbed, 'Let me in--let me in!'  'Who are you?' I\nasked, struggling, meanwhile, to disengage myself.  'Catherine Linton,'\nit replied, shiveringly (why did I think of _Linton_?  I had read\n_Earnshaw_ twenty times for Linton)--'I'm come home: I'd lost my way on\nthe moor!'  As it spoke, I discerned, obscurely, a child's face looking\nthrough the window.  Terror made me cruel; and, finding it useless to\nattempt shaking the creature off, I pulled its wrist on to the broken\npane, and rubbed it to and fro till the blood ran down and soaked the\nbedclothes: still it wailed, 'Let me in!' and maintained its tenacious\ngripe, almost maddening me with fear.  'How can I!' I said at length.\n'Let _me_ go, if you want me to let you in!'  The fingers relaxed, I\nsnatched mine through the hole, hurriedly piled the books up in a pyramid\nagainst it, and stopped my ears to exclude the lamentable prayer.  I\nseemed to keep them closed above a quarter of an hour; yet, the instant I\nlistened again, there was the doleful cry moaning on!  'Begone!' I\nshouted.  'I'll never let you in, not if you beg for twenty years.'  'It\nis twenty years,' mourned the voice: 'twenty years.  I've been a waif for\ntwenty years!'  Thereat began a feeble scratching outside, and the pile\nof books moved as if thrust forward.  I tried to jump up; but could not\nstir a limb; and so yelled aloud, in a frenzy of fright.  To my\nconfusion, I discovered the yell was not ideal: hasty footsteps\napproached my chamber door; somebody pushed it open, with a vigorous\nhand, and a light glimmered through the squares at the top of the bed.  I\nsat shuddering yet, and wiping the perspiration from my forehead: the\nintruder appeared to hesitate, and muttered to himself.  At last, he\nsaid, in a half-whisper, plainly not expecting an answer, 'Is any one\nhere?'  I considered it best to confess my presence; for I knew\nHeathcliff's accents, and feared he might search further, if I kept\nquiet.  With this intention, I turned and opened the panels.  I shall not\nsoon forget the effect my action produced.\n\nHeathcliff stood near the entrance, in his shirt and trousers; with a\ncandle dripping over his fingers, and his face as white as the wall\nbehind him.  The first creak of the oak startled him like an electric\nshock: the light leaped from his hold to a distance of some feet, and his\nagitation was so extreme, that he could hardly pick it up.\n\n'It is only your guest, sir,' I called out, desirous to spare him the\nhumiliation of exposing his cowardice further.  'I had the misfortune to\nscream in my sleep, owing to a frightful nightmare.  I'm sorry I\ndisturbed you.'\n\n'Oh, God confound you, Mr. Lockwood!  I wish you were at the--' commenced\nmy host, setting the candle on a chair, because he found it impossible to\nhold it steady.  'And who showed you up into this room?' he continued,\ncrushing his nails into his palms, and grinding his teeth to subdue the\nmaxillary convulsions.  'Who was it?  I've a good mind to turn them out\nof the house this moment?'\n\n'It was your servant Zillah,' I replied, flinging myself on to the floor,\nand rapidly resuming my garments.  'I should not care if you did, Mr.\nHeathcliff; she richly deserves it.  I suppose that she wanted to get\nanother proof that the place was haunted, at my expense.  Well, it\nis--swarming with ghosts and goblins!  You have reason in shutting it up,\nI assure you.  No one will thank you for a doze in such a den!'\n\n'What do you mean?' asked Heathcliff, 'and what are you doing?  Lie down\nand finish out the night, since you _are_ here; but, for heaven's sake!\ndon't repeat that horrid noise: nothing could excuse it, unless you were\nhaving your throat cut!'\n\n'If the little fiend had got in at the window, she probably would have\nstrangled me!' I returned.  'I'm not going to endure the persecutions of\nyour hospitable ancestors again.  Was not the Reverend Jabez Branderham\nakin to you on the mother's side?  And that minx, Catherine Linton, or\nEarnshaw, or however she was called--she must have been a\nchangeling--wicked little soul!  She told me she had been walking the\nearth these twenty years: a just punishment for her mortal\ntransgressions, I've no doubt!'\n\nScarcely were these words uttered when I recollected the association of\nHeathcliff's with Catherine's name in the book, which had completely\nslipped from my memory, till thus awakened.  I blushed at my\ninconsideration: but, without showing further consciousness of the\noffence, I hastened to add--'The truth is, sir, I passed the first part\nof the night in--'  Here I stopped afresh--I was about to say 'perusing\nthose old volumes,' then it would have revealed my knowledge of their\nwritten, as well as their printed, contents; so, correcting myself, I\nwent on--'in spelling over the name scratched on that window-ledge.  A\nmonotonous occupation, calculated to set me asleep, like counting, or--'\n\n'What _can_ you mean by talking in this way to _me_!' thundered\nHeathcliff with savage vehemence.  'How--how _dare_ you, under my\nroof?--God! he's mad to speak so!'  And he struck his forehead with rage.\n\nI did not know whether to resent this language or pursue my explanation;\nbut he seemed so powerfully affected that I took pity and proceeded with\nmy dreams; affirming I had never heard the appellation of 'Catherine\nLinton' before, but reading it often over produced an impression which\npersonified itself when I had no longer my imagination under control.\nHeathcliff gradually fell back into the shelter of the bed, as I spoke;\nfinally sitting down almost concealed behind it.  I guessed, however, by\nhis irregular and intercepted breathing, that he struggled to vanquish an\nexcess of violent emotion.  Not liking to show him that I had heard the\nconflict, I continued my toilette rather noisily, looked at my watch, and\nsoliloquised on the length of the night: 'Not three o'clock yet!  I could\nhave taken oath it had been six.  Time stagnates here: we must surely\nhave retired to rest at eight!'\n\n'Always at nine in winter, and rise at four,' said my host, suppressing a\ngroan: and, as I fancied, by the motion of his arm's shadow, dashing a\ntear from his eyes.  'Mr. Lockwood,' he added, 'you may go into my room:\nyou'll only be in the way, coming down-stairs so early: and your childish\noutcry has sent sleep to the devil for me.'\n\n'And for me, too,' I replied.  'I'll walk in the yard till daylight, and\nthen I'll be off; and you need not dread a repetition of my intrusion.\nI'm now quite cured of seeking pleasure in society, be it country or\ntown.  A sensible man ought to find sufficient company in himself.'\n\n'Delightful company!' muttered Heathcliff.  'Take the candle, and go\nwhere you please.  I shall join you directly.  Keep out of the yard,\nthough, the dogs are unchained; and the house--Juno mounts sentinel\nthere, and--nay, you can only ramble about the steps and passages.  But,\naway with you!  I'll come in two minutes!'\n\nI obeyed, so far as to quit the chamber; when, ignorant where the narrow\nlobbies led, I stood still, and was witness, involuntarily, to a piece of\nsuperstition on the part of my landlord which belied, oddly, his apparent\nsense.  He got on to the bed, and wrenched open the lattice, bursting, as\nhe pulled at it, into an uncontrollable passion of tears.  'Come in! come\nin!' he sobbed.  'Cathy, do come.  Oh, do--_once_ more!  Oh! my heart's\ndarling! hear me _this_ time, Catherine, at last!'  The spectre showed a\nspectre's ordinary caprice: it gave no sign of being; but the snow and\nwind whirled wildly through, even reaching my station, and blowing out\nthe light.\n\nThere was such anguish in the gush of grief that accompanied this raving,\nthat my compassion made me overlook its folly, and I drew off, half angry\nto have listened at all, and vexed at having related my ridiculous\nnightmare, since it produced that agony; though _why_ was beyond my\ncomprehension.  I descended cautiously to the lower regions, and landed\nin the back-kitchen, where a gleam of fire, raked compactly together,\nenabled me to rekindle my candle.  Nothing was stirring except a\nbrindled, grey cat, which crept from the ashes, and saluted me with a\nquerulous mew.\n\nTwo benches, shaped in sections of a circle, nearly enclosed the hearth;\non one of these I stretched myself, and Grimalkin mounted the other.  We\nwere both of us nodding ere any one invaded our retreat, and then it was\nJoseph, shuffling down a wooden ladder that vanished in the roof, through\na trap: the ascent to his garret, I suppose.  He cast a sinister look at\nthe little flame which I had enticed to play between the ribs, swept the\ncat from its elevation, and bestowing himself in the vacancy, commenced\nthe operation of stuffing a three-inch pipe with tobacco.  My presence in\nhis sanctum was evidently esteemed a piece of impudence too shameful for\nremark: he silently applied the tube to his lips, folded his arms, and\npuffed away.  I let him enjoy the luxury unannoyed; and after sucking out\nhis last wreath, and heaving a profound sigh, he got up, and departed as\nsolemnly as he came.\n\nA more elastic footstep entered next; and now I opened my mouth for a\n'good-morning,' but closed it again, the salutation unachieved; for\nHareton Earnshaw was performing his orison _sotto voce_, in a series of\ncurses directed against every object he touched, while he rummaged a\ncorner for a spade or shovel to dig through the drifts.  He glanced over\nthe back of the bench, dilating his nostrils, and thought as little of\nexchanging civilities with me as with my companion the cat.  I guessed,\nby his preparations, that egress was allowed, and, leaving my hard couch,\nmade a movement to follow him.  He noticed this, and thrust at an inner\ndoor with the end of his spade, intimating by an inarticulate sound that\nthere was the place where I must go, if I changed my locality.\n\nIt opened into the house, where the females were already astir; Zillah\nurging flakes of flame up the chimney with a colossal bellows; and Mrs.\nHeathcliff, kneeling on the hearth, reading a book by the aid of the\nblaze.  She held her hand interposed between the furnace-heat and her\neyes, and seemed absorbed in her occupation; desisting from it only to\nchide the servant for covering her with sparks, or to push away a dog,\nnow and then, that snoozled its nose overforwardly into her face.  I was\nsurprised to see Heathcliff there also.  He stood by the fire, his back\ntowards me, just finishing a stormy scene with poor Zillah; who ever and\nanon interrupted her labour to pluck up the corner of her apron, and\nheave an indignant groan.\n\n'And you, you worthless--' he broke out as I entered, turning to his\ndaughter-in-law, and employing an epithet as harmless as duck, or sheep,\nbut generally represented by a dash--.  'There you are, at your idle\ntricks again!  The rest of them do earn their bread--you live on my\ncharity!  Put your trash away, and find something to do.  You shall pay\nme for the plague of having you eternally in my sight--do you hear,\ndamnable jade?'\n\n'I'll put my trash away, because you can make me if I refuse,' answered\nthe young lady, closing her book, and throwing it on a chair.  'But I'll\nnot do anything, though you should swear your tongue out, except what I\nplease!'\n\nHeathcliff lifted his hand, and the speaker sprang to a safer distance,\nobviously acquainted with its weight.  Having no desire to be entertained\nby a cat-and-dog combat, I stepped forward briskly, as if eager to\npartake the warmth of the hearth, and innocent of any knowledge of the\ninterrupted dispute.  Each had enough decorum to suspend further\nhostilities: Heathcliff placed his fists, out of temptation, in his\npockets; Mrs. Heathcliff curled her lip, and walked to a seat far off,\nwhere she kept her word by playing the part of a statue during the\nremainder of my stay.  That was not long.  I declined joining their\nbreakfast, and, at the first gleam of dawn, took an opportunity of\nescaping into the free air, now clear, and still, and cold as impalpable\nice.\n\nMy landlord halloed for me to stop ere I reached the bottom of the\ngarden, and offered to accompany me across the moor.  It was well he did,\nfor the whole hill-back was one billowy, white ocean; the swells and\nfalls not indicating corresponding rises and depressions in the ground:\nmany pits, at least, were filled to a level; and entire ranges of mounds,\nthe refuse of the quarries, blotted from the chart which my yesterday's\nwalk left pictured in my mind.  I had remarked on one side of the road,\nat intervals of six or seven yards, a line of upright stones, continued\nthrough the whole length of the barren: these were erected and daubed\nwith lime on purpose to serve as guides in the dark, and also when a\nfall, like the present, confounded the deep swamps on either hand with\nthe firmer path: but, excepting a dirty dot pointing up here and there,\nall traces of their existence had vanished: and my companion found it\nnecessary to warn me frequently to steer to the right or left, when I\nimagined I was following, correctly, the windings of the road.\n\nWe exchanged little conversation, and he halted at the entrance of\nThrushcross Park, saying, I could make no error there.  Our adieux were\nlimited to a hasty bow, and then I pushed forward, trusting to my own\nresources; for the porter's lodge is untenanted as yet.  The distance\nfrom the gate to the grange is two miles; I believe I managed to make it\nfour, what with losing myself among the trees, and sinking up to the neck\nin snow: a predicament which only those who have experienced it can\nappreciate.  At any rate, whatever were my wanderings, the clock chimed\ntwelve as I entered the house; and that gave exactly an hour for every\nmile of the usual way from Wuthering Heights.\n\nMy human fixture and her satellites rushed to welcome me; exclaiming,\ntumultuously, they had completely given me up: everybody conjectured that\nI perished last night; and they were wondering how they must set about\nthe search for my remains.  I bid them be quiet, now that they saw me\nreturned, and, benumbed to my very heart, I dragged up-stairs; whence,\nafter putting on dry clothes, and pacing to and fro thirty or forty\nminutes, to restore the animal heat, I adjourned to my study, feeble as a\nkitten: almost too much so to enjoy the cheerful fire and smoking coffee\nwhich the servant had prepared for my refreshment.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV\n\n\nWhat vain weathercocks we are!  I, who had determined to hold myself\nindependent of all social intercourse, and thanked my stars that, at\nlength, I had lighted on a spot where it was next to impracticable--I,\nweak wretch, after maintaining till dusk a struggle with low spirits and\nsolitude, was finally compelled to strike my colours; and under pretence\nof gaining information concerning the necessities of my establishment, I\ndesired Mrs. Dean, when she brought in supper, to sit down while I ate\nit; hoping sincerely she would prove a regular gossip, and either rouse\nme to animation or lull me to sleep by her talk.\n\n'You have lived here a considerable time,' I commenced; 'did you not say\nsixteen years?'\n\n'Eighteen, sir: I came when the mistress was married, to wait on her;\nafter she died, the master retained me for his housekeeper.'\n\n'Indeed.'\n\nThere ensued a pause.  She was not a gossip, I feared; unless about her\nown affairs, and those could hardly interest me.  However, having studied\nfor an interval, with a fist on either knee, and a cloud of meditation\nover her ruddy countenance, she ejaculated--'Ah, times are greatly\nchanged since then!'\n\n'Yes,' I remarked, 'you've seen a good many alterations, I suppose?'\n\n'I have: and troubles too,' she said.\n\n'Oh, I'll turn the talk on my landlord's family!' I thought to myself.  'A\ngood subject to start!  And that pretty girl-widow, I should like to know\nher history: whether she be a native of the country, or, as is more\nprobable, an exotic that the surly _indigenae_ will not recognise for\nkin.'  With this intention I asked Mrs. Dean why Heathcliff let\nThrushcross Grange, and preferred living in a situation and residence so\nmuch inferior.  'Is he not rich enough to keep the estate in good order?'\nI inquired.\n\n'Rich, sir!' she returned.  'He has nobody knows what money, and every\nyear it increases.  Yes, yes, he's rich enough to live in a finer house\nthan this: but he's very near--close-handed; and, if he had meant to flit\nto Thrushcross Grange, as soon as he heard of a good tenant he could not\nhave borne to miss the chance of getting a few hundreds more.  It is\nstrange people should be so greedy, when they are alone in the world!'\n\n'He had a son, it seems?'\n\n'Yes, he had one--he is dead.'\n\n'And that young lady, Mrs. Heathcliff, is his widow?'\n\n'Yes.'\n\n'Where did she come from originally?'\n\n'Why, sir, she is my late master's daughter: Catherine Linton was her\nmaiden name.  I nursed her, poor thing!  I did wish Mr. Heathcliff would\nremove here, and then we might have been together again.'\n\n'What!  Catherine Linton?' I exclaimed, astonished.  But a minute's\nreflection convinced me it was not my ghostly Catherine.  'Then,' I\ncontinued, 'my predecessor's name was Linton?'\n\n'It was.'\n\n'And who is that Earnshaw: Hareton Earnshaw, who lives with Mr.\nHeathcliff?  Are they relations?'\n\n'No; he is the late Mrs. Linton's nephew.'\n\n'The young lady's cousin, then?'\n\n'Yes; and her husband was her cousin also: one on the mother's, the other\non the father's side: Heathcliff married Mr. Linton's sister.'\n\n'I see the house at Wuthering Heights has \"Earnshaw\" carved over the\nfront door.  Are they an old family?'\n\n'Very old, sir; and Hareton is the last of them, as our Miss Cathy is of\nus--I mean, of the Lintons.  Have you been to Wuthering Heights?  I beg\npardon for asking; but I should like to hear how she is!'\n\n'Mrs. Heathcliff? she looked very well, and very handsome; yet, I think,\nnot very happy.'\n\n'Oh dear, I don't wonder!  And how did you like the master?'\n\n'A rough fellow, rather, Mrs. Dean.  Is not that his character?\n\n'Rough as a saw-edge, and hard as whinstone!  The less you meddle with\nhim the better.'\n\n'He must have had some ups and downs in life to make him such a churl.  Do\nyou know anything of his history?'\n\n'It's a cuckoo's, sir--I know all about it: except where he was born, and\nwho were his parents, and how he got his money at first.  And Hareton has\nbeen cast out like an unfledged dunnock!  The unfortunate lad is the only\none in all this parish that does not guess how he has been cheated.'\n\n'Well, Mrs. Dean, it will be a charitable deed to tell me something of my\nneighbours: I feel I shall not rest if I go to bed; so be good enough to\nsit and chat an hour.'\n\n'Oh, certainly, sir!  I'll just fetch a little sewing, and then I'll sit\nas long as you please.  But you've caught cold: I saw you shivering, and\nyou must have some gruel to drive it out.'\n\nThe worthy woman bustled off, and I crouched nearer the fire; my head\nfelt hot, and the rest of me chill: moreover, I was excited, almost to a\npitch of foolishness, through my nerves and brain.  This caused me to\nfeel, not uncomfortable, but rather fearful (as I am still) of serious\neffects from the incidents of to-day and yesterday.  She returned\npresently, bringing a smoking basin and a basket of work; and, having\nplaced the former on the hob, drew in her seat, evidently pleased to find\nme so companionable.\n\nBefore I came to live here, she commenced--waiting no farther invitation\nto her story--I was almost always at Wuthering Heights; because my mother\nhad nursed Mr. Hindley Earnshaw, that was Hareton's father, and I got\nused to playing with the children: I ran errands too, and helped to make\nhay, and hung about the farm ready for anything that anybody would set me\nto.  One fine summer morning--it was the beginning of harvest, I\nremember--Mr. Earnshaw, the old master, came down-stairs, dressed for a\njourney; and, after he had told Joseph what was to be done during the\nday, he turned to Hindley, and Cathy, and me--for I sat eating my\nporridge with them--and he said, speaking to his son, 'Now, my bonny man,\nI'm going to Liverpool to-day, what shall I bring you?  You may choose\nwhat you like: only let it be little, for I shall walk there and back:\nsixty miles each way, that is a long spell!'  Hindley named a fiddle, and\nthen he asked Miss Cathy; she was hardly six years old, but she could\nride any horse in the stable, and she chose a whip.  He did not forget\nme; for he had a kind heart, though he was rather severe sometimes.  He\npromised to bring me a pocketful of apples and pears, and then he kissed\nhis children, said good-bye, and set off.\n\nIt seemed a long while to us all--the three days of his absence--and\noften did little Cathy ask when he would be home.  Mrs. Earnshaw expected\nhim by supper-time on the third evening, and she put the meal off hour\nafter hour; there were no signs of his coming, however, and at last the\nchildren got tired of running down to the gate to look.  Then it grew\ndark; she would have had them to bed, but they begged sadly to be allowed\nto stay up; and, just about eleven o'clock, the door-latch was raised\nquietly, and in stepped the master.  He threw himself into a chair,\nlaughing and groaning, and bid them all stand off, for he was nearly\nkilled--he would not have such another walk for the three kingdoms.\n\n'And at the end of it to be flighted to death!' he said, opening his\ngreat-coat, which he held bundled up in his arms.  'See here, wife!  I\nwas never so beaten with anything in my life: but you must e'en take it\nas a gift of God; though it's as dark almost as if it came from the\ndevil.'\n\nWe crowded round, and over Miss Cathy's head I had a peep at a dirty,\nragged, black-haired child; big enough both to walk and talk: indeed, its\nface looked older than Catherine's; yet when it was set on its feet, it\nonly stared round, and repeated over and over again some gibberish that\nnobody could understand.  I was frightened, and Mrs. Earnshaw was ready\nto fling it out of doors: she did fly up, asking how he could fashion to\nbring that gipsy brat into the house, when they had their own bairns to\nfeed and fend for?  What he meant to do with it, and whether he were mad?\nThe master tried to explain the matter; but he was really half dead with\nfatigue, and all that I could make out, amongst her scolding, was a tale\nof his seeing it starving, and houseless, and as good as dumb, in the\nstreets of Liverpool, where he picked it up and inquired for its owner.\nNot a soul knew to whom it belonged, he said; and his money and time\nbeing both limited, he thought it better to take it home with him at\nonce, than run into vain expenses there: because he was determined he\nwould not leave it as he found it.  Well, the conclusion was, that my\nmistress grumbled herself calm; and Mr. Earnshaw told me to wash it, and\ngive it clean things, and let it sleep with the children.\n\nHindley and Cathy contented themselves with looking and listening till\npeace was restored: then, both began searching their father's pockets\nfor the presents he had promised them. The former was a boy of fourteen,\nbut when he drew out what had been a fiddle, crushed to morsels in the\ngreat-coat, he blubbered aloud; and Cathy, when she learned the master\nhad lost her whip in attending on the stranger, showed her humour by\ngrinning and spitting at the stupid little thing; earning for her pains\na sound blow from her father, to teach her cleaner manners. They\nentirely refused to have it in bed with them, or even in their room; and\nI had no more sense, so I put it on the landing of the stairs, hoping it\nmight be gone on the morrow. By chance, or else attracted by hearing his\nvoice, it crept to Mr. Earnshaw's door, and there he found it on\nquitting his chamber. Inquiries were made as to how it got there; I was\nobliged to confess, and in recompense for my cowardice and inhumanity\nwas sent out of the house.\n\nThis was Heathcliff's first introduction to the family.  On coming back a\nfew days afterwards (for I did not consider my banishment perpetual), I\nfound they had christened him 'Heathcliff': it was the name of a son who\ndied in childhood, and it has served him ever since, both for Christian\nand surname.  Miss Cathy and he were now very thick; but Hindley hated\nhim: and to say the truth I did the same; and we plagued and went on with\nhim shamefully: for I wasn't reasonable enough to feel my injustice, and\nthe mistress never put in a word on his behalf when she saw him wronged.\n\nHe seemed a sullen, patient child; hardened, perhaps, to ill-treatment:\nhe would stand Hindley's blows without winking or shedding a tear, and my\npinches moved him only to draw in a breath and open his eyes, as if he\nhad hurt himself by accident, and nobody was to blame.  This endurance\nmade old Earnshaw furious, when he discovered his son persecuting the\npoor fatherless child, as he called him.  He took to Heathcliff\nstrangely, believing all he said (for that matter, he said precious\nlittle, and generally the truth), and petting him up far above Cathy, who\nwas too mischievous and wayward for a favourite.\n\nSo, from the very beginning, he bred bad feeling in the house; and at\nMrs. Earnshaw's death, which happened in less than two years after, the\nyoung master had learned to regard his father as an oppressor rather than\na friend, and Heathcliff as a usurper of his parent's affections and his\nprivileges; and he grew bitter with brooding over these injuries.  I\nsympathised a while; but when the children fell ill of the measles, and I\nhad to tend them, and take on me the cares of a woman at once, I changed\nmy idea.  Heathcliff was dangerously sick; and while he lay at the worst\nhe would have me constantly by his pillow: I suppose he felt I did a good\ndeal for him, and he hadn't wit to guess that I was compelled to do it.\nHowever, I will say this, he was the quietest child that ever nurse\nwatched over.  The difference between him and the others forced me to be\nless partial.  Cathy and her brother harassed me terribly: he was as\nuncomplaining as a lamb; though hardness, not gentleness, made him give\nlittle trouble.\n\nHe got through, and the doctor affirmed it was in a great measure owing\nto me, and praised me for my care.  I was vain of his commendations, and\nsoftened towards the being by whose means I earned them, and thus Hindley\nlost his last ally: still I couldn't dote on Heathcliff, and I wondered\noften what my master saw to admire so much in the sullen boy; who never,\nto my recollection, repaid his indulgence by any sign of gratitude.  He\nwas not insolent to his benefactor, he was simply insensible; though\nknowing perfectly the hold he had on his heart, and conscious he had only\nto speak and all the house would be obliged to bend to his wishes.  As an\ninstance, I remember Mr. Earnshaw once bought a couple of colts at the\nparish fair, and gave the lads each one.  Heathcliff took the handsomest,\nbut it soon fell lame, and when he discovered it, he said to Hindley--\n\n'You must exchange horses with me: I don't like mine; and if you won't I\nshall tell your father of the three thrashings you've given me this week,\nand show him my arm, which is black to the shoulder.'  Hindley put out\nhis tongue, and cuffed him over the ears.  'You'd better do it at once,'\nhe persisted, escaping to the porch (they were in the stable): 'you will\nhave to: and if I speak of these blows, you'll get them again with\ninterest.'  'Off, dog!' cried Hindley, threatening him with an iron\nweight used for weighing potatoes and hay.  'Throw it,' he replied,\nstanding still, 'and then I'll tell how you boasted that you would turn\nme out of doors as soon as he died, and see whether he will not turn you\nout directly.'  Hindley threw it, hitting him on the breast, and down he\nfell, but staggered up immediately, breathless and white; and, had not I\nprevented it, he would have gone just so to the master, and got full\nrevenge by letting his condition plead for him, intimating who had caused\nit.  'Take my colt, Gipsy, then!' said young Earnshaw.  'And I pray that\nhe may break your neck: take him, and be damned, you beggarly interloper!\nand wheedle my father out of all he has: only afterwards show him what\nyou are, imp of Satan.--And take that, I hope he'll kick out your\nbrains!'\n\nHeathcliff had gone to loose the beast, and shift it to his own stall; he\nwas passing behind it, when Hindley finished his speech by knocking him\nunder its feet, and without stopping to examine whether his hopes were\nfulfilled, ran away as fast as he could.  I was surprised to witness how\ncoolly the child gathered himself up, and went on with his intention;\nexchanging saddles and all, and then sitting down on a bundle of hay to\novercome the qualm which the violent blow occasioned, before he entered\nthe house.  I persuaded him easily to let me lay the blame of his bruises\non the horse: he minded little what tale was told since he had what he\nwanted.  He complained so seldom, indeed, of such stirs as these, that I\nreally thought him not vindictive: I was deceived completely, as you will\nhear.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V\n\n\nIn the course of time Mr. Earnshaw began to fail. He had been active and\nhealthy, yet his strength left him suddenly; and when he was confined to\nthe chimney-corner he grew grievously irritable. A nothing vexed him;\nand suspected slights of his authority nearly threw him into fits. This\nwas especially to be remarked if any one attempted to impose upon, or\ndomineer over, his favourite: he was painfully jealous lest a word\nshould be spoken amiss to him; seeming to have got into his head the\nnotion that, because he liked Heathcliff, all hated, and longed to do\nhim an ill-turn. It was a disadvantage to the lad; for the kinder among\nus did not wish to fret the master, so we humoured his partiality; and\nthat humouring was rich nourishment to the child's pride and black\ntempers. Still it became in a manner necessary; twice, or thrice,\nHindley's manifestation of scorn, while his father was near, roused the\nold man to a fury: he seized his stick to strike him, and shook with\nrage that he could not do it.\n\nAt last, our curate (we had a curate then who made the living answer by\nteaching the little Lintons and Earnshaws, and farming his bit of land\nhimself) advised that the young man should be sent to college; and Mr.\nEarnshaw agreed, though with a heavy spirit, for he said--'Hindley was\nnought, and would never thrive as where he wandered.'\n\nI hoped heartily we should have peace now.  It hurt me to think the\nmaster should be made uncomfortable by his own good deed.  I fancied the\ndiscontent of age and disease arose from his family disagreements; as he\nwould have it that it did: really, you know, sir, it was in his sinking\nframe.  We might have got on tolerably, notwithstanding, but for two\npeople--Miss Cathy, and Joseph, the servant: you saw him, I daresay, up\nyonder.  He was, and is yet most likely, the wearisomest self-righteous\nPharisee that ever ransacked a Bible to rake the promises to himself and\nfling the curses to his neighbours.  By his knack of sermonising and\npious discoursing, he contrived to make a great impression on Mr.\nEarnshaw; and the more feeble the master became, the more influence he\ngained.  He was relentless in worrying him about his soul's concerns, and\nabout ruling his children rigidly.  He encouraged him to regard Hindley\nas a reprobate; and, night after night, he regularly grumbled out a long\nstring of tales against Heathcliff and Catherine: always minding to\nflatter Earnshaw's weakness by heaping the heaviest blame on the latter.\n\nCertainly she had ways with her such as I never saw a child take up\nbefore; and she put all of us past our patience fifty times and oftener\nin a day: from the hour she came down-stairs till the hour she went to\nbed, we had not a minute's security that she wouldn't be in mischief.  Her\nspirits were always at high-water mark, her tongue always going--singing,\nlaughing, and plaguing everybody who would not do the same.  A wild,\nwicked slip she was--but she had the bonniest eye, the sweetest smile,\nand lightest foot in the parish: and, after all, I believe she meant no\nharm; for when once she made you cry in good earnest, it seldom happened\nthat she would not keep you company, and oblige you to be quiet that you\nmight comfort her.  She was much too fond of Heathcliff.  The greatest\npunishment we could invent for her was to keep her separate from him: yet\nshe got chided more than any of us on his account.  In play, she liked\nexceedingly to act the little mistress; using her hands freely, and\ncommanding her companions: she did so to me, but I would not bear\nslapping and ordering; and so I let her know.\n\nNow, Mr. Earnshaw did not understand jokes from his children: he had\nalways been strict and grave with them; and Catherine, on her part, had\nno idea why her father should be crosser and less patient in his ailing\ncondition than he was in his prime.  His peevish reproofs wakened in her\na naughty delight to provoke him: she was never so happy as when we were\nall scolding her at once, and she defying us with her bold, saucy look,\nand her ready words; turning Joseph's religious curses into ridicule,\nbaiting me, and doing just what her father hated most--showing how her\npretended insolence, which he thought real, had more power over\nHeathcliff than his kindness: how the boy would do _her_ bidding in\nanything, and _his_ only when it suited his own inclination.  After\nbehaving as badly as possible all day, she sometimes came fondling to\nmake it up at night.  'Nay, Cathy,' the old man would say, 'I cannot love\nthee, thou'rt worse than thy brother.  Go, say thy prayers, child, and\nask God's pardon.  I doubt thy mother and I must rue that we ever reared\nthee!'  That made her cry, at first; and then being repulsed continually\nhardened her, and she laughed if I told her to say she was sorry for her\nfaults, and beg to be forgiven.\n\nBut the hour came, at last, that ended Mr. Earnshaw's troubles on earth.\nHe died quietly in his chair one October evening, seated by the\nfire-side.  A high wind blustered round the house, and roared in the\nchimney: it sounded wild and stormy, yet it was not cold, and we were all\ntogether--I, a little removed from the hearth, busy at my knitting, and\nJoseph reading his Bible near the table (for the servants generally sat\nin the house then, after their work was done).  Miss Cathy had been sick,\nand that made her still; she leant against her father's knee, and\nHeathcliff was lying on the floor with his head in her lap.  I remember\nthe master, before he fell into a doze, stroking her bonny hair--it\npleased him rarely to see her gentle--and saying, 'Why canst thou not\nalways be a good lass, Cathy?'  And she turned her face up to his, and\nlaughed, and answered, 'Why cannot you always be a good man, father?'  But\nas soon as she saw him vexed again, she kissed his hand, and said she\nwould sing him to sleep.  She began singing very low, till his fingers\ndropped from hers, and his head sank on his breast.  Then I told her to\nhush, and not stir, for fear she should wake him.  We all kept as mute as\nmice a full half-hour, and should have done so longer, only Joseph,\nhaving finished his chapter, got up and said that he must rouse the\nmaster for prayers and bed.  He stepped forward, and called him by name,\nand touched his shoulder; but he would not move: so he took the candle\nand looked at him.  I thought there was something wrong as he set down\nthe light; and seizing the children each by an arm, whispered them to\n'frame up-stairs, and make little din--they might pray alone that\nevening--he had summut to do.'\n\n'I shall bid father good-night first,' said Catherine, putting her arms\nround his neck, before we could hinder her.  The poor thing discovered\nher loss directly--she screamed out--'Oh, he's dead, Heathcliff! he's\ndead!'  And they both set up a heart-breaking cry.\n\nI joined my wail to theirs, loud and bitter; but Joseph asked what we\ncould be thinking of to roar in that way over a saint in heaven.  He told\nme to put on my cloak and run to Gimmerton for the doctor and the parson.\nI could not guess the use that either would be of, then.  However, I\nwent, through wind and rain, and brought one, the doctor, back with me;\nthe other said he would come in the morning.  Leaving Joseph to explain\nmatters, I ran to the children's room: their door was ajar, I saw they\nhad never lain down, though it was past midnight; but they were calmer,\nand did not need me to console them.  The little souls were comforting\neach other with better thoughts than I could have hit on: no parson in\nthe world ever pictured heaven so beautifully as they did, in their\ninnocent talk; and, while I sobbed and listened, I could not help wishing\nwe were all there safe together.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI\n\n\nMr. Hindley came home to the funeral; and--a thing that amazed us, and\nset the neighbours gossiping right and left--he brought a wife with him.\nWhat she was, and where she was born, he never informed us: probably, she\nhad neither money nor name to recommend her, or he would scarcely have\nkept the union from his father.\n\nShe was not one that would have disturbed the house much on her own\naccount.  Every object she saw, the moment she crossed the threshold,\nappeared to delight her; and every circumstance that took place about\nher: except the preparing for the burial, and the presence of the\nmourners.  I thought she was half silly, from her behaviour while that\nwent on: she ran into her chamber, and made me come with her, though I\nshould have been dressing the children: and there she sat shivering and\nclasping her hands, and asking repeatedly--'Are they gone yet?'  Then she\nbegan describing with hysterical emotion the effect it produced on her to\nsee black; and started, and trembled, and, at last, fell a-weeping--and\nwhen I asked what was the matter, answered, she didn't know; but she felt\nso afraid of dying!  I imagined her as little likely to die as myself.\nShe was rather thin, but young, and fresh-complexioned, and her eyes\nsparkled as bright as diamonds.  I did remark, to be sure, that mounting\nthe stairs made her breathe very quick; that the least sudden noise set\nher all in a quiver, and that she coughed troublesomely sometimes: but I\nknew nothing of what these symptoms portended, and had no impulse to\nsympathise with her.  We don't in general take to foreigners here, Mr.\nLockwood, unless they take to us first.\n\nYoung Earnshaw was altered considerably in the three years of his\nabsence. He had grown sparer, and lost his colour, and spoke and dressed\nquite differently; and, on the very day of his return, he told Joseph\nand me we must thenceforth quarter ourselves in the back-kitchen, and\nleave the house for him. Indeed, he would have carpeted and papered a\nsmall spare room for a parlour; but his wife expressed such pleasure at\nthe white floor and huge glowing fireplace, at the pewter dishes and\ndelf-case, and dog-kennel, and the wide space there was to move about in\nwhere they usually sat, that he thought it unnecessary to her comfort,\nand so dropped the intention.\n\nShe expressed pleasure, too, at finding a sister among her new\nacquaintance; and she prattled to Catherine, and kissed her, and ran\nabout with her, and gave her quantities of presents, at the beginning.\nHer affection tired very soon, however, and when she grew peevish,\nHindley became tyrannical.  A few words from her, evincing a dislike to\nHeathcliff, were enough to rouse in him all his old hatred of the boy.  He\ndrove him from their company to the servants, deprived him of the\ninstructions of the curate, and insisted that he should labour out of\ndoors instead; compelling him to do so as hard as any other lad on the\nfarm.\n\nHeathcliff bore his degradation pretty well at first, because Cathy\ntaught him what she learnt, and worked or played with him in the fields.\nThey both promised fair to grow up as rude as savages; the young master\nbeing entirely negligent how they behaved, and what they did, so they\nkept clear of him.  He would not even have seen after their going to\nchurch on Sundays, only Joseph and the curate reprimanded his\ncarelessness when they absented themselves; and that reminded him to\norder Heathcliff a flogging, and Catherine a fast from dinner or supper.\nBut it was one of their chief amusements to run away to the moors in the\nmorning and remain there all day, and the after punishment grew a mere\nthing to laugh at.  The curate might set as many chapters as he pleased\nfor Catherine to get by heart, and Joseph might thrash Heathcliff till\nhis arm ached; they forgot everything the minute they were together\nagain: at least the minute they had contrived some naughty plan of\nrevenge; and many a time I've cried to myself to watch them growing more\nreckless daily, and I not daring to speak a syllable, for fear of losing\nthe small power I still retained over the unfriended creatures.  One\nSunday evening, it chanced that they were banished from the sitting-room,\nfor making a noise, or a light offence of the kind; and when I went to\ncall them to supper, I could discover them nowhere.  We searched the\nhouse, above and below, and the yard and stables; they were invisible:\nand, at last, Hindley in a passion told us to bolt the doors, and swore\nnobody should let them in that night.  The household went to bed; and I,\ntoo, anxious to lie down, opened my lattice and put my head out to\nhearken, though it rained: determined to admit them in spite of the\nprohibition, should they return.  In a while, I distinguished steps\ncoming up the road, and the light of a lantern glimmered through the\ngate.  I threw a shawl over my head and ran to prevent them from waking\nMr. Earnshaw by knocking.  There was Heathcliff, by himself: it gave me a\nstart to see him alone.\n\n'Where is Miss Catherine?' I cried hurriedly. 'No accident, I hope?' 'At\nThrushcross Grange,' he answered; 'and I would have been there too, but\nthey had not the manners to ask me to stay.' 'Well, you will catch it!'\nI said: 'you'll never be content till you're sent about your business.\nWhat in the world led you wandering to Thrushcross Grange?' 'Let me get\noff my wet clothes, and I'll tell you all about it, Nelly,' he replied.\nI bid him beware of rousing the master, and while he undressed and I\nwaited to put out the candle, he continued--'Cathy and I escaped from\nthe wash-house to have a ramble at liberty, and getting a glimpse of the\nGrange lights, we thought we would just go and see whether the Lintons\npassed their Sunday evenings standing shivering in corners, while their\nfather and mother sat eating and drinking, and singing and laughing, and\nburning their eyes out before the fire. Do you think they do? Or reading\nsermons, and being catechised by their manservant, and set to learn a\ncolumn of Scripture names, if they don't answer properly?' 'Probably\nnot,' I responded. 'They are good children, no doubt, and don't deserve\nthe treatment you receive, for your bad conduct.' 'Don't cant, Nelly,'\nhe said: 'nonsense! We ran from the top of the Heights to the park,\nwithout stopping--Catherine completely beaten in the race, because she\nwas barefoot. You'll have to seek for her shoes in the bog to-morrow. We\ncrept through a broken hedge, groped our way up the path, and planted\nourselves on a flower-plot under the drawing-room window. The light came\nfrom thence; they had not put up the shutters, and the curtains were\nonly half closed. Both of us were able to look in by standing on the\nbasement, and clinging to the ledge, and we saw--ah! it was beautiful--a\nsplendid place carpeted with crimson, and crimson-covered chairs and\ntables, and a pure white ceiling bordered by gold, a shower of\nglass-drops hanging in silver chains from the centre, and shimmering\nwith little soft tapers. Old Mr. and Mrs. Linton were not there; Edgar\nand his sisters had it entirely to themselves. Shouldn't they have been\nhappy? We should have thought ourselves in heaven! And now, guess what\nyour good children were doing? Isabella--I believe she is eleven, a year\nyounger than Cathy--lay screaming at the farther end of the room,\nshrieking as if witches were running red-hot needles into her. Edgar\nstood on the hearth weeping silently, and in the middle of the table sat\na little dog, shaking its paw and yelping; which, from their mutual\naccusations, we understood they had nearly pulled in two between them.\nThe idiots! That was their pleasure! to quarrel who should hold a heap\nof warm hair, and each begin to cry because both, after struggling to\nget it, refused to take it. We laughed outright at the petted things; we\ndid despise them! When would you catch me wishing to have what Catherine\nwanted? or find us by ourselves, seeking entertainment in yelling, and\nsobbing, and rolling on the ground, divided by the whole room? I'd not\nexchange, for a thousand lives, my condition here, for Edgar Linton's at\nThrushcross Grange--not if I might have the privilege of flinging Joseph\noff the highest gable, and painting the house-front with Hindley's\nblood!'\n\n'Hush, hush!' I interrupted.  'Still you have not told me, Heathcliff,\nhow Catherine is left behind?'\n\n'I told you we laughed,' he answered. 'The Lintons heard us, and with\none accord they shot like arrows to the door; there was silence, and\nthen a cry, \"Oh, mamma, mamma! Oh, papa! Oh, mamma, come here. Oh, papa,\noh!\" They really did howl out something in that way. We made frightful\nnoises to terrify them still more, and then we dropped off the ledge,\nbecause somebody was drawing the bars, and we felt we had better flee. I\nhad Cathy by the hand, and was urging her on, when all at once she fell\ndown. \"Run, Heathcliff, run!\" she whispered. \"They have let the bull-dog\nloose, and he holds me!\" The devil had seized her ankle, Nelly: I heard\nhis abominable snorting. She did not yell out--no! she would have\nscorned to do it, if she had been spitted on the horns of a mad cow. I\ndid, though: I vociferated curses enough to annihilate any fiend in\nChristendom; and I got a stone and thrust it between his jaws, and tried\nwith all my might to cram it down his throat. A beast of a servant came\nup with a lantern, at last, shouting--\"Keep fast, Skulker, keep fast!\"\nHe changed his note, however, when he saw Skulker's game. The dog was\nthrottled off; his huge, purple tongue hanging half a foot out of his\nmouth, and his pendent lips streaming with bloody slaver. The man took\nCathy up; she was sick: not from fear, I'm certain, but from pain. He\ncarried her in; I followed, grumbling execrations and vengeance. \"What\nprey, Robert?\" hallooed Linton from the entrance. \"Skulker has caught a\nlittle girl, sir,\" he replied; \"and there's a lad here,\" he added,\nmaking a clutch at me, \"who looks an out-and-outer! Very like the\nrobbers were for putting them through the window to open the doors to\nthe gang after all were asleep, that they might murder us at their ease.\nHold your tongue, you foul-mouthed thief, you! you shall go to the\ngallows for this. Mr. Linton, sir, don't lay by your gun.\" \"No, no,\nRobert,\" said the old fool. \"The rascals knew that yesterday was my\nrent-day: they thought to have me cleverly. Come in; I'll furnish them a\nreception. There, John, fasten the chain. Give Skulker some water,\nJenny. To beard a magistrate in his stronghold, and on the Sabbath, too!\nWhere will their insolence stop? Oh, my dear Mary, look here! Don't be\nafraid, it is but a boy--yet the villain scowls so plainly in his face;\nwould it not be a kindness to the country to hang him at once, before he\nshows his nature in acts as well as features?\" He pulled me under the\nchandelier, and Mrs. Linton placed her spectacles on her nose and raised\nher hands in horror. The cowardly children crept nearer also, Isabella\nlisping--\"Frightful thing! Put him in the cellar, papa. He's exactly\nlike the son of the fortune-teller that stole my tame pheasant. Isn't\nhe, Edgar?\"\n\n'While they examined me, Cathy came round; she heard the last speech, and\nlaughed.  Edgar Linton, after an inquisitive stare, collected sufficient\nwit to recognise her.  They see us at church, you know, though we seldom\nmeet them elsewhere.  \"That's Miss Earnshaw?\" he whispered to his mother,\n\"and look how Skulker has bitten her--how her foot bleeds!\"\n\n'\"Miss Earnshaw?  Nonsense!\" cried the dame; \"Miss Earnshaw scouring the\ncountry with a gipsy!  And yet, my dear, the child is in mourning--surely\nit is--and she may be lamed for life!\"\n\n'\"What culpable carelessness in her brother!\" exclaimed Mr. Linton,\nturning from me to Catherine.  \"I've understood from Shielders\"' (that\nwas the curate, sir) '\"that he lets her grow up in absolute heathenism.\nBut who is this?  Where did she pick up this companion?  Oho! I declare\nhe is that strange acquisition my late neighbour made, in his journey to\nLiverpool--a little Lascar, or an American or Spanish castaway.\"\n\n'\"A wicked boy, at all events,\" remarked the old lady, \"and quite unfit\nfor a decent house!  Did you notice his language, Linton?  I'm shocked\nthat my children should have heard it.\"\n\n'I recommenced cursing--don't be angry, Nelly--and so Robert was ordered\nto take me off.  I refused to go without Cathy; he dragged me into the\ngarden, pushed the lantern into my hand, assured me that Mr. Earnshaw\nshould be informed of my behaviour, and, bidding me march directly,\nsecured the door again.  The curtains were still looped up at one corner,\nand I resumed my station as spy; because, if Catherine had wished to\nreturn, I intended shattering their great glass panes to a million of\nfragments, unless they let her out.  She sat on the sofa quietly.  Mrs.\nLinton took off the grey cloak of the dairy-maid which we had borrowed\nfor our excursion, shaking her head and expostulating with her, I\nsuppose: she was a young lady, and they made a distinction between her\ntreatment and mine.  Then the woman-servant brought a basin of warm\nwater, and washed her feet; and Mr. Linton mixed a tumbler of negus, and\nIsabella emptied a plateful of cakes into her lap, and Edgar stood gaping\nat a distance.  Afterwards, they dried and combed her beautiful hair, and\ngave her a pair of enormous slippers, and wheeled her to the fire; and I\nleft her, as merry as she could be, dividing her food between the little\ndog and Skulker, whose nose she pinched as he ate; and kindling a spark\nof spirit in the vacant blue eyes of the Lintons--a dim reflection from\nher own enchanting face.  I saw they were full of stupid admiration; she\nis so immeasurably superior to them--to everybody on earth, is she not,\nNelly?'\n\n'There will more come of this business than you reckon on,' I answered,\ncovering him up and extinguishing the light.  'You are incurable,\nHeathcliff; and Mr. Hindley will have to proceed to extremities, see if\nhe won't.'  My words came truer than I desired.  The luckless adventure\nmade Earnshaw furious.  And then Mr. Linton, to mend matters, paid us a\nvisit himself on the morrow, and read the young master such a lecture on\nthe road he guided his family, that he was stirred to look about him, in\nearnest.  Heathcliff received no flogging, but he was told that the first\nword he spoke to Miss Catherine should ensure a dismissal; and Mrs.\nEarnshaw undertook to keep her sister-in-law in due restraint when she\nreturned home; employing art, not force: with force she would have found\nit impossible.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII\n\n\nCathy stayed at Thrushcross Grange five weeks: till Christmas.  By that\ntime her ankle was thoroughly cured, and her manners much improved.  The\nmistress visited her often in the interval, and commenced her plan of\nreform by trying to raise her self-respect with fine clothes and\nflattery, which she took readily; so that, instead of a wild, hatless\nlittle savage jumping into the house, and rushing to squeeze us all\nbreathless, there 'lighted from a handsome black pony a very dignified\nperson, with brown ringlets falling from the cover of a feathered beaver,\nand a long cloth habit, which she was obliged to hold up with both hands\nthat she might sail in.  Hindley lifted her from her horse, exclaiming\ndelightedly, 'Why, Cathy, you are quite a beauty!  I should scarcely have\nknown you: you look like a lady now.  Isabella Linton is not to be\ncompared with her, is she, Frances?'  'Isabella has not her natural\nadvantages,' replied his wife: 'but she must mind and not grow wild again\nhere.  Ellen, help Miss Catherine off with her things--Stay, dear, you\nwill disarrange your curls--let me untie your hat.'\n\nI removed the habit, and there shone forth beneath a grand plaid silk\nfrock, white trousers, and burnished shoes; and, while her eyes sparkled\njoyfully when the dogs came bounding up to welcome her, she dared hardly\ntouch them lest they should fawn upon her splendid garments.  She kissed\nme gently: I was all flour making the Christmas cake, and it would not\nhave done to give me a hug; and then she looked round for Heathcliff.  Mr.\nand Mrs. Earnshaw watched anxiously their meeting; thinking it would\nenable them to judge, in some measure, what grounds they had for hoping\nto succeed in separating the two friends.\n\nHeathcliff was hard to discover, at first.  If he were careless, and\nuncared for, before Catherine's absence, he had been ten times more so\nsince.  Nobody but I even did him the kindness to call him a dirty boy,\nand bid him wash himself, once a week; and children of his age seldom\nhave a natural pleasure in soap and water.  Therefore, not to mention his\nclothes, which had seen three months' service in mire and dust, and his\nthick uncombed hair, the surface of his face and hands was dismally\nbeclouded.  He might well skulk behind the settle, on beholding such a\nbright, graceful damsel enter the house, instead of a rough-headed\ncounterpart of himself, as he expected.  'Is Heathcliff not here?' she\ndemanded, pulling off her gloves, and displaying fingers wonderfully\nwhitened with doing nothing and staying indoors.\n\n'Heathcliff, you may come forward,' cried Mr. Hindley, enjoying his\ndiscomfiture, and gratified to see what a forbidding young blackguard he\nwould be compelled to present himself.  'You may come and wish Miss\nCatherine welcome, like the other servants.'\n\nCathy, catching a glimpse of her friend in his concealment, flew to\nembrace him; she bestowed seven or eight kisses on his cheek within the\nsecond, and then stopped, and drawing back, burst into a laugh,\nexclaiming, 'Why, how very black and cross you look! and how--how funny\nand grim!  But that's because I'm used to Edgar and Isabella Linton.\nWell, Heathcliff, have you forgotten me?'\n\nShe had some reason to put the question, for shame and pride threw double\ngloom over his countenance, and kept him immovable.\n\n'Shake hands, Heathcliff,' said Mr. Earnshaw, condescendingly; 'once in a\nway that is permitted.'\n\n'I shall not,' replied the boy, finding his tongue at last; 'I shall not\nstand to be laughed at.  I shall not bear it!'  And he would have broken\nfrom the circle, but Miss Cathy seized him again.\n\n'I did not mean to laugh at you,' she said; 'I could not hinder myself:\nHeathcliff, shake hands at least!  What are you sulky for?  It was only\nthat you looked odd.  If you wash your face and brush your hair, it will\nbe all right: but you are so dirty!'\n\nShe gazed concernedly at the dusky fingers she held in her own, and also\nat her dress; which she feared had gained no embellishment from its\ncontact with his.\n\n'You needn't have touched me!' he answered, following her eye and\nsnatching away his hand.  'I shall be as dirty as I please: and I like to\nbe dirty, and I will be dirty.'\n\nWith that he dashed headforemost out of the room, amid the merriment of\nthe master and mistress, and to the serious disturbance of Catherine; who\ncould not comprehend how her remarks should have produced such an\nexhibition of bad temper.\n\nAfter playing lady's-maid to the new-comer, and putting my cakes in the\noven, and making the house and kitchen cheerful with great fires,\nbefitting Christmas-eve, I prepared to sit down and amuse myself by\nsinging carols, all alone; regardless of Joseph's affirmations that he\nconsidered the merry tunes I chose as next door to songs.  He had retired\nto private prayer in his chamber, and Mr. and Mrs. Earnshaw were engaging\nMissy's attention by sundry gay trifles bought for her to present to the\nlittle Lintons, as an acknowledgment of their kindness.  They had invited\nthem to spend the morrow at Wuthering Heights, and the invitation had\nbeen accepted, on one condition: Mrs. Linton begged that her darlings\nmight be kept carefully apart from that 'naughty swearing boy.'\n\nUnder these circumstances I remained solitary.  I smelt the rich scent of\nthe heating spices; and admired the shining kitchen utensils, the\npolished clock, decked in holly, the silver mugs ranged on a tray ready\nto be filled with mulled ale for supper; and above all, the speckless\npurity of my particular care--the scoured and well-swept floor.  I gave\ndue inward applause to every object, and then I remembered how old\nEarnshaw used to come in when all was tidied, and call me a cant lass,\nand slip a shilling into my hand as a Christmas-box; and from that I went\non to think of his fondness for Heathcliff, and his dread lest he should\nsuffer neglect after death had removed him: and that naturally led me to\nconsider the poor lad's situation now, and from singing I changed my mind\nto crying.  It struck me soon, however, there would be more sense in\nendeavouring to repair some of his wrongs than shedding tears over them:\nI got up and walked into the court to seek him.  He was not far; I found\nhim smoothing the glossy coat of the new pony in the stable, and feeding\nthe other beasts, according to custom.\n\n'Make haste, Heathcliff!' I said, 'the kitchen is so comfortable; and\nJoseph is up-stairs: make haste, and let me dress you smart before Miss\nCathy comes out, and then you can sit together, with the whole hearth to\nyourselves, and have a long chatter till bedtime.'\n\nHe proceeded with his task, and never turned his head towards me.\n\n'Come--are you coming?' I continued.  'There's a little cake for each of\nyou, nearly enough; and you'll need half-an-hour's donning.'\n\nI waited five minutes, but getting no answer left him.  Catherine supped\nwith her brother and sister-in-law: Joseph and I joined at an unsociable\nmeal, seasoned with reproofs on one side and sauciness on the other.  His\ncake and cheese remained on the table all night for the fairies.  He\nmanaged to continue work till nine o'clock, and then marched dumb and\ndour to his chamber.  Cathy sat up late, having a world of things to\norder for the reception of her new friends: she came into the kitchen\nonce to speak to her old one; but he was gone, and she only stayed to ask\nwhat was the matter with him, and then went back.  In the morning he rose\nearly; and, as it was a holiday, carried his ill-humour on to the moors;\nnot re-appearing till the family were departed for church.  Fasting and\nreflection seemed to have brought him to a better spirit.  He hung about\nme for a while, and having screwed up his courage, exclaimed\nabruptly--'Nelly, make me decent, I'm going to be good.'\n\n'High time, Heathcliff,' I said; 'you _have_ grieved Catherine: she's\nsorry she ever came home, I daresay!  It looks as if you envied her,\nbecause she is more thought of than you.'\n\nThe notion of _envying_ Catherine was incomprehensible to him, but the\nnotion of grieving her he understood clearly enough.\n\n'Did she say she was grieved?' he inquired, looking very serious.\n\n'She cried when I told her you were off again this morning.'\n\n'Well, _I_ cried last night,' he returned, 'and I had more reason to cry\nthan she.'\n\n'Yes: you had the reason of going to bed with a proud heart and an empty\nstomach,' said I.  'Proud people breed sad sorrows for themselves.  But,\nif you be ashamed of your touchiness, you must ask pardon, mind, when she\ncomes in.  You must go up and offer to kiss her, and say--you know best\nwhat to say; only do it heartily, and not as if you thought her converted\ninto a stranger by her grand dress.  And now, though I have dinner to get\nready, I'll steal time to arrange you so that Edgar Linton shall look\nquite a doll beside you: and that he does.  You are younger, and yet,\nI'll be bound, you are taller and twice as broad across the shoulders;\nyou could knock him down in a twinkling; don't you feel that you could?'\n\nHeathcliff's face brightened a moment; then it was overcast afresh, and\nhe sighed.\n\n'But, Nelly, if I knocked him down twenty times, that wouldn't make him\nless handsome or me more so.  I wish I had light hair and a fair skin,\nand was dressed and behaved as well, and had a chance of being as rich as\nhe will be!'\n\n'And cried for mamma at every turn,' I added, 'and trembled if a country\nlad heaved his fist against you, and sat at home all day for a shower of\nrain.  Oh, Heathcliff, you are showing a poor spirit!  Come to the glass,\nand I'll let you see what you should wish.  Do you mark those two lines\nbetween your eyes; and those thick brows, that, instead of rising arched,\nsink in the middle; and that couple of black fiends, so deeply buried,\nwho never open their windows boldly, but lurk glinting under them, like\ndevil's spies?  Wish and learn to smooth away the surly wrinkles, to\nraise your lids frankly, and change the fiends to confident, innocent\nangels, suspecting and doubting nothing, and always seeing friends where\nthey are not sure of foes.  Don't get the expression of a vicious cur\nthat appears to know the kicks it gets are its desert, and yet hates all\nthe world, as well as the kicker, for what it suffers.'\n\n'In other words, I must wish for Edgar Linton's great blue eyes and even\nforehead,' he replied.  'I do--and that won't help me to them.'\n\n'A good heart will help you to a bonny face, my lad,' I continued, 'if\nyou were a regular black; and a bad one will turn the bonniest into\nsomething worse than ugly.  And now that we've done washing, and combing,\nand sulking--tell me whether you don't think yourself rather handsome?\nI'll tell you, I do.  You're fit for a prince in disguise.  Who knows but\nyour father was Emperor of China, and your mother an Indian queen, each\nof them able to buy up, with one week's income, Wuthering Heights and\nThrushcross Grange together?  And you were kidnapped by wicked sailors\nand brought to England.  Were I in your place, I would frame high notions\nof my birth; and the thoughts of what I was should give me courage and\ndignity to support the oppressions of a little farmer!'\n\nSo I chattered on; and Heathcliff gradually lost his frown and began to\nlook quite pleasant, when all at once our conversation was interrupted by\na rumbling sound moving up the road and entering the court.  He ran to\nthe window and I to the door, just in time to behold the two Lintons\ndescend from the family carriage, smothered in cloaks and furs, and the\nEarnshaws dismount from their horses: they often rode to church in\nwinter.  Catherine took a hand of each of the children, and brought them\ninto the house and set them before the fire, which quickly put colour\ninto their white faces.\n\nI urged my companion to hasten now and show his amiable humour, and he\nwillingly obeyed; but ill luck would have it that, as he opened the door\nleading from the kitchen on one side, Hindley opened it on the other.\nThey met, and the master, irritated at seeing him clean and cheerful, or,\nperhaps, eager to keep his promise to Mrs. Linton, shoved him back with a\nsudden thrust, and angrily bade Joseph 'keep the fellow out of the\nroom--send him into the garret till dinner is over.  He'll be cramming\nhis fingers in the tarts and stealing the fruit, if left alone with them\na minute.'\n\n'Nay, sir,' I could not avoid answering, 'he'll touch nothing, not he:\nand I suppose he must have his share of the dainties as well as we.'\n\n'He shall have his share of my hand, if I catch him downstairs till\ndark,' cried Hindley.  'Begone, you vagabond!  What! you are attempting\nthe coxcomb, are you?  Wait till I get hold of those elegant locks--see\nif I won't pull them a bit longer!'\n\n'They are long enough already,' observed Master Linton, peeping from the\ndoorway; 'I wonder they don't make his head ache.  It's like a colt's\nmane over his eyes!'\n\nHe ventured this remark without any intention to insult; but Heathcliff's\nviolent nature was not prepared to endure the appearance of impertinence\nfrom one whom he seemed to hate, even then, as a rival.  He seized a\ntureen of hot apple sauce (the first thing that came under his gripe) and\ndashed it full against the speaker's face and neck; who instantly\ncommenced a lament that brought Isabella and Catherine hurrying to the\nplace.  Mr. Earnshaw snatched up the culprit directly and conveyed him to\nhis chamber; where, doubtless, he administered a rough remedy to cool the\nfit of passion, for he appeared red and breathless.  I got the dishcloth,\nand rather spitefully scrubbed Edgar's nose and mouth, affirming it\nserved him right for meddling.  His sister began weeping to go home, and\nCathy stood by confounded, blushing for all.\n\n'You should not have spoken to him!' she expostulated with Master Linton.\n'He was in a bad temper, and now you've spoilt your visit; and he'll be\nflogged: I hate him to be flogged!  I can't eat my dinner.  Why did you\nspeak to him, Edgar?'\n\n'I didn't,' sobbed the youth, escaping from my hands, and finishing the\nremainder of the purification with his cambric pocket-handkerchief.  'I\npromised mamma that I wouldn't say one word to him, and I didn't.'\n\n'Well, don't cry,' replied Catherine, contemptuously; 'you're not killed.\nDon't make more mischief; my brother is coming: be quiet!  Hush,\nIsabella!  Has anybody hurt you?'\n\n'There, there, children--to your seats!' cried Hindley, bustling in.\n'That brute of a lad has warmed me nicely.  Next time, Master Edgar, take\nthe law into your own fists--it will give you an appetite!'\n\nThe little party recovered its equanimity at sight of the fragrant feast.\nThey were hungry after their ride, and easily consoled, since no real\nharm had befallen them.  Mr. Earnshaw carved bountiful platefuls, and the\nmistress made them merry with lively talk.  I waited behind her chair,\nand was pained to behold Catherine, with dry eyes and an indifferent air,\ncommence cutting up the wing of a goose before her.  'An unfeeling\nchild,' I thought to myself; 'how lightly she dismisses her old\nplaymate's troubles.  I could not have imagined her to be so selfish.'\nShe lifted a mouthful to her lips: then she set it down again: her cheeks\nflushed, and the tears gushed over them.  She slipped her fork to the\nfloor, and hastily dived under the cloth to conceal her emotion.  I did\nnot call her unfeeling long; for I perceived she was in purgatory\nthroughout the day, and wearying to find an opportunity of getting by\nherself, or paying a visit to Heathcliff, who had been locked up by the\nmaster: as I discovered, on endeavouring to introduce to him a private\nmess of victuals.\n\nIn the evening we had a dance.  Cathy begged that he might be liberated\nthen, as Isabella Linton had no partner: her entreaties were vain, and I\nwas appointed to supply the deficiency.  We got rid of all gloom in the\nexcitement of the exercise, and our pleasure was increased by the arrival\nof the Gimmerton band, mustering fifteen strong: a trumpet, a trombone,\nclarionets, bassoons, French horns, and a bass viol, besides singers.\nThey go the rounds of all the respectable houses, and receive\ncontributions every Christmas, and we esteemed it a first-rate treat to\nhear them.  After the usual carols had been sung, we set them to songs\nand glees.  Mrs. Earnshaw loved the music, and so they gave us plenty.\n\nCatherine loved it too: but she said it sounded sweetest at the top of\nthe steps, and she went up in the dark: I followed. They shut the house\ndoor below, never noting our absence, it was so full of people. She made\nno stay at the stairs'-head, but mounted farther, to the garret where\nHeathcliff was confined, and called him. He stubbornly declined\nanswering for a while: she persevered, and finally persuaded him to hold\ncommunion with her through the boards. I let the poor things converse\nunmolested, till I supposed the songs were going to cease, and the\nsingers to get some refreshment: then I clambered up the ladder to warn\nher. Instead of finding her outside, I heard her voice within. The\nlittle monkey had crept by the skylight of one garret, along the roof,\ninto the skylight of the other, and it was with the utmost difficulty I\ncould coax her out again. When she did come, Heathcliff came with her,\nand she insisted that I should take him into the kitchen, as my\nfellow-servant had gone to a neighbour's, to be removed from the sound\nof our 'devil's psalmody,' as it pleased him to call it. I told them I\nintended by no means to encourage their tricks: but as the prisoner had\nnever broken his fast since yesterday's dinner, I would wink at his\ncheating Mr. Hindley that once. He went down: I set him a stool by the\nfire, and offered him a quantity of good things: but he was sick and\ncould eat little, and my attempts to entertain him were thrown away. He\nleant his two elbows on his knees, and his chin on his hands and\nremained rapt in dumb meditation. On my inquiring the subject of his\nthoughts, he answered gravely--'I'm trying to settle how I shall pay\nHindley back. I don't care how long I wait, if I can only do it at last.\nI hope he will not die before I do!'\n\n'For shame, Heathcliff!' said I.  'It is for God to punish wicked people;\nwe should learn to forgive.'\n\n'No, God won't have the satisfaction that I shall,' he returned.  'I only\nwish I knew the best way!  Let me alone, and I'll plan it out: while I'm\nthinking of that I don't feel pain.'\n\n'But, Mr. Lockwood, I forget these tales cannot divert you.  I'm annoyed\nhow I should dream of chattering on at such a rate; and your gruel cold,\nand you nodding for bed!  I could have told Heathcliff's history, all\nthat you need hear, in half a dozen words.'\n\n* * * * *\n\nThus interrupting herself, the housekeeper rose, and proceeded to lay\naside her sewing; but I felt incapable of moving from the hearth, and I\nwas very far from nodding.  'Sit still, Mrs. Dean,' I cried; 'do sit\nstill another half-hour.  You've done just right to tell the story\nleisurely.  That is the method I like; and you must finish it in the same\nstyle.  I am interested in every character you have mentioned, more or\nless.'\n\n'The clock is on the stroke of eleven, sir.'\n\n'No matter--I'm not accustomed to go to bed in the long hours.  One or\ntwo is early enough for a person who lies till ten.'\n\n'You shouldn't lie till ten.  There's the very prime of the morning gone\nlong before that time.  A person who has not done one-half his day's work\nby ten o'clock, runs a chance of leaving the other half undone.'\n\n'Nevertheless, Mrs. Dean, resume your chair; because to-morrow I intend\nlengthening the night till afternoon.  I prognosticate for myself an\nobstinate cold, at least.'\n\n'I hope not, sir.  Well, you must allow me to leap over some three years;\nduring that space Mrs. Earnshaw--'\n\n'No, no, I'll allow nothing of the sort!  Are you acquainted with the\nmood of mind in which, if you were seated alone, and the cat licking its\nkitten on the rug before you, you would watch the operation so intently\nthat puss's neglect of one ear would put you seriously out of temper?'\n\n'A terribly lazy mood, I should say.'\n\n'On the contrary, a tiresomely active one. It is mine, at present; and,\ntherefore, continue minutely. I perceive that people in these regions\nacquire over people in towns the value that a spider in a dungeon does\nover a spider in a cottage, to their various occupants; and yet the\ndeepened attraction is not entirely owing to the situation of the\nlooker-on. They _do_ live more in earnest, more in themselves, and less\nin surface, change, and frivolous external things. I could fancy a love\nfor life here almost possible; and I was a fixed unbeliever in any love\nof a year's standing. One state resembles setting a hungry man down to a\nsingle dish, on which he may concentrate his entire appetite and do it\njustice; the other, introducing him to a table laid out by French cooks:\nhe can perhaps extract as much enjoyment from the whole; but each part\nis a mere atom in his regard and remembrance.'\n\n'Oh! here we are the same as anywhere else, when you get to know us,'\nobserved Mrs. Dean, somewhat puzzled at my speech.\n\n'Excuse me,' I responded; 'you, my good friend, are a striking evidence\nagainst that assertion.  Excepting a few provincialisms of slight\nconsequence, you have no marks of the manners which I am habituated to\nconsider as peculiar to your class.  I am sure you have thought a great\ndeal more than the generality of servants think.  You have been compelled\nto cultivate your reflective faculties for want of occasions for\nfrittering your life away in silly trifles.'\n\nMrs. Dean laughed.\n\n'I certainly esteem myself a steady, reasonable kind of body,' she said;\n'not exactly from living among the hills and seeing one set of faces, and\none series of actions, from year's end to year's end; but I have\nundergone sharp discipline, which has taught me wisdom; and then, I have\nread more than you would fancy, Mr. Lockwood.  You could not open a book\nin this library that I have not looked into, and got something out of\nalso: unless it be that range of Greek and Latin, and that of French; and\nthose I know one from another: it is as much as you can expect of a poor\nman's daughter.  However, if I am to follow my story in true gossip's\nfashion, I had better go on; and instead of leaping three years, I will\nbe content to pass to the next summer--the summer of 1778, that is nearly\ntwenty-three years ago.'\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII\n\n\nOn the morning of a fine June day my first bonny little nursling, and the\nlast of the ancient Earnshaw stock, was born.  We were busy with the hay\nin a far-away field, when the girl that usually brought our breakfasts\ncame running an hour too soon across the meadow and up the lane, calling\nme as she ran.\n\n'Oh, such a grand bairn!' she panted out.  'The finest lad that ever\nbreathed!  But the doctor says missis must go: he says she's been in a\nconsumption these many months.  I heard him tell Mr. Hindley: and now she\nhas nothing to keep her, and she'll be dead before winter.  You must come\nhome directly.  You're to nurse it, Nelly: to feed it with sugar and\nmilk, and take care of it day and night.  I wish I were you, because it\nwill be all yours when there is no missis!'\n\n'But is she very ill?' I asked, flinging down my rake and tying my\nbonnet.\n\n'I guess she is; yet she looks bravely,' replied the girl, 'and she talks\nas if she thought of living to see it grow a man.  She's out of her head\nfor joy, it's such a beauty!  If I were her I'm certain I should not die:\nI should get better at the bare sight of it, in spite of Kenneth.  I was\nfairly mad at him.  Dame Archer brought the cherub down to master, in the\nhouse, and his face just began to light up, when the old croaker steps\nforward, and says he--\"Earnshaw, it's a blessing your wife has been\nspared to leave you this son.  When she came, I felt convinced we\nshouldn't keep her long; and now, I must tell you, the winter will\nprobably finish her.  Don't take on, and fret about it too much: it can't\nbe helped.  And besides, you should have known better than to choose such\na rush of a lass!\"'\n\n'And what did the master answer?' I inquired.\n\n'I think he swore: but I didn't mind him, I was straining to see the\nbairn,' and she began again to describe it rapturously.  I, as zealous as\nherself, hurried eagerly home to admire, on my part; though I was very\nsad for Hindley's sake.  He had room in his heart only for two idols--his\nwife and himself: he doted on both, and adored one, and I couldn't\nconceive how he would bear the loss.\n\nWhen we got to Wuthering Heights, there he stood at the front door; and,\nas I passed in, I asked, 'how was the baby?'\n\n'Nearly ready to run about, Nell!' he replied, putting on a cheerful\nsmile.\n\n'And the mistress?' I ventured to inquire; 'the doctor says she's--'\n\n'Damn the doctor!' he interrupted, reddening.  'Frances is quite right:\nshe'll be perfectly well by this time next week.  Are you going\nup-stairs? will you tell her that I'll come, if she'll promise not to\ntalk.  I left her because she would not hold her tongue; and she\nmust--tell her Mr. Kenneth says she must be quiet.'\n\nI delivered this message to Mrs. Earnshaw; she seemed in flighty spirits,\nand replied merrily, 'I hardly spoke a word, Ellen, and there he has gone\nout twice, crying.  Well, say I promise I won't speak: but that does not\nbind me not to laugh at him!'\n\nPoor soul!  Till within a week of her death that gay heart never failed\nher; and her husband persisted doggedly, nay, furiously, in affirming her\nhealth improved every day.  When Kenneth warned him that his medicines\nwere useless at that stage of the malady, and he needn't put him to\nfurther expense by attending her, he retorted, 'I know you need not--she's\nwell--she does not want any more attendance from you!  She never was in a\nconsumption.  It was a fever; and it is gone: her pulse is as slow as\nmine now, and her cheek as cool.'\n\nHe told his wife the same story, and she seemed to believe him; but one\nnight, while leaning on his shoulder, in the act of saying she thought\nshe should be able to get up to-morrow, a fit of coughing took her--a\nvery slight one--he raised her in his arms; she put her two hands about\nhis neck, her face changed, and she was dead.\n\nAs the girl had anticipated, the child Hareton fell wholly into my hands.\nMr. Earnshaw, provided he saw him healthy and never heard him cry, was\ncontented, as far as regarded him.  For himself, he grew desperate: his\nsorrow was of that kind that will not lament.  He neither wept nor\nprayed; he cursed and defied: execrated God and man, and gave himself up\nto reckless dissipation.  The servants could not bear his tyrannical and\nevil conduct long: Joseph and I were the only two that would stay.  I had\nnot the heart to leave my charge; and besides, you know, I had been his\nfoster-sister, and excused his behaviour more readily than a stranger\nwould.  Joseph remained to hector over tenants and labourers; and because\nit was his vocation to be where he had plenty of wickedness to reprove.\n\nThe master's bad ways and bad companions formed a pretty example for\nCatherine and Heathcliff.  His treatment of the latter was enough to make\na fiend of a saint.  And, truly, it appeared as if the lad _were_\npossessed of something diabolical at that period.  He delighted to\nwitness Hindley degrading himself past redemption; and became daily more\nnotable for savage sullenness and ferocity.  I could not half tell what\nan infernal house we had.  The curate dropped calling, and nobody decent\ncame near us, at last; unless Edgar Linton's visits to Miss Cathy might\nbe an exception.  At fifteen she was the queen of the country-side; she\nhad no peer; and she did turn out a haughty, headstrong creature!  I own\nI did not like her, after infancy was past; and I vexed her frequently by\ntrying to bring down her arrogance: she never took an aversion to me,\nthough.  She had a wondrous constancy to old attachments: even Heathcliff\nkept his hold on her affections unalterably; and young Linton, with all\nhis superiority, found it difficult to make an equally deep impression.\nHe was my late master: that is his portrait over the fireplace.  It used\nto hang on one side, and his wife's on the other; but hers has been\nremoved, or else you might see something of what she was.  Can you make\nthat out?\n\nMrs. Dean raised the candle, and I discerned a soft-featured face,\nexceedingly resembling the young lady at the Heights, but more pensive\nand amiable in expression.  It formed a sweet picture.  The long light\nhair curled slightly on the temples; the eyes were large and serious; the\nfigure almost too graceful.  I did not marvel how Catherine Earnshaw\ncould forget her first friend for such an individual.  I marvelled much\nhow he, with a mind to correspond with his person, could fancy my idea of\nCatherine Earnshaw.\n\n'A very agreeable portrait,' I observed to the house-keeper.  'Is it\nlike?'\n\n'Yes,' she answered; 'but he looked better when he was animated; that is\nhis everyday countenance: he wanted spirit in general.'\n\nCatherine had kept up her acquaintance with the Lintons since her\nfive-weeks' residence among them; and as she had no temptation to show\nher rough side in their company, and had the sense to be ashamed of\nbeing rude where she experienced such invariable courtesy, she imposed\nunwittingly on the old lady and gentleman by her ingenious cordiality;\ngained the admiration of Isabella, and the heart and soul of her\nbrother: acquisitions that flattered her from the first--for she was\nfull of ambition--and led her to adopt a double character without\nexactly intending to deceive any one. In the place where she heard\nHeathcliff termed a 'vulgar young ruffian,' and 'worse than a brute,'\nshe took care not to act like him; but at home she had small inclination\nto practise politeness that would only be laughed at, and restrain an\nunruly nature when it would bring her neither credit nor praise.\n\nMr. Edgar seldom mustered courage to visit Wuthering Heights openly.  He\nhad a terror of Earnshaw's reputation, and shrunk from encountering him;\nand yet he was always received with our best attempts at civility: the\nmaster himself avoided offending him, knowing why he came; and if he\ncould not be gracious, kept out of the way.  I rather think his\nappearance there was distasteful to Catherine; she was not artful, never\nplayed the coquette, and had evidently an objection to her two friends\nmeeting at all; for when Heathcliff expressed contempt of Linton in his\npresence, she could not half coincide, as she did in his absence; and\nwhen Linton evinced disgust and antipathy to Heathcliff, she dared not\ntreat his sentiments with indifference, as if depreciation of her\nplaymate were of scarcely any consequence to her.  I've had many a laugh\nat her perplexities and untold troubles, which she vainly strove to hide\nfrom my mockery.  That sounds ill-natured: but she was so proud it became\nreally impossible to pity her distresses, till she should be chastened\ninto more humility.  She did bring herself, finally, to confess, and to\nconfide in me: there was not a soul else that she might fashion into an\nadviser.\n\nMr. Hindley had gone from home one afternoon, and Heathcliff presumed to\ngive himself a holiday on the strength of it.  He had reached the age of\nsixteen then, I think, and without having bad features, or being\ndeficient in intellect, he contrived to convey an impression of inward\nand outward repulsiveness that his present aspect retains no traces of.\nIn the first place, he had by that time lost the benefit of his early\neducation: continual hard work, begun soon and concluded late, had\nextinguished any curiosity he once possessed in pursuit of knowledge, and\nany love for books or learning.  His childhood's sense of superiority,\ninstilled into him by the favours of old Mr. Earnshaw, was faded away.  He\nstruggled long to keep up an equality with Catherine in her studies, and\nyielded with poignant though silent regret: but he yielded completely;\nand there was no prevailing on him to take a step in the way of moving\nupward, when he found he must, necessarily, sink beneath his former\nlevel.  Then personal appearance sympathised with mental deterioration:\nhe acquired a slouching gait and ignoble look; his naturally reserved\ndisposition was exaggerated into an almost idiotic excess of unsociable\nmoroseness; and he took a grim pleasure, apparently, in exciting the\naversion rather than the esteem of his few acquaintances.\n\nCatherine and he were constant companions still at his seasons of respite\nfrom labour; but he had ceased to express his fondness for her in words,\nand recoiled with angry suspicion from her girlish caresses, as if\nconscious there could be no gratification in lavishing such marks of\naffection on him.  On the before-named occasion he came into the house to\nannounce his intention of doing nothing, while I was assisting Miss Cathy\nto arrange her dress: she had not reckoned on his taking it into his head\nto be idle; and imagining she would have the whole place to herself, she\nmanaged, by some means, to inform Mr. Edgar of her brother's absence, and\nwas then preparing to receive him.\n\n'Cathy, are you busy this afternoon?' asked Heathcliff.  'Are you going\nanywhere?'\n\n'No, it is raining,' she answered.\n\n'Why have you that silk frock on, then?' he said.  'Nobody coming here, I\nhope?'\n\n'Not that I know of,' stammered Miss: 'but you should be in the field\nnow, Heathcliff.  It is an hour past dinnertime: I thought you were\ngone.'\n\n'Hindley does not often free us from his accursed presence,' observed the\nboy.  'I'll not work any more to-day: I'll stay with you.'\n\n'Oh, but Joseph will tell,' she suggested; 'you'd better go!'\n\n'Joseph is loading lime on the further side of Penistone Crags; it will\ntake him till dark, and he'll never know.'\n\nSo, saying, he lounged to the fire, and sat down.  Catherine reflected an\ninstant, with knitted brows--she found it needful to smooth the way for\nan intrusion.  'Isabella and Edgar Linton talked of calling this\nafternoon,' she said, at the conclusion of a minute's silence.  'As it\nrains, I hardly expect them; but they may come, and if they do, you run\nthe risk of being scolded for no good.'\n\n'Order Ellen to say you are engaged, Cathy,' he persisted; 'don't turn me\nout for those pitiful, silly friends of yours!  I'm on the point,\nsometimes, of complaining that they--but I'll not--'\n\n'That they what?' cried Catherine, gazing at him with a troubled\ncountenance.  'Oh, Nelly!' she added petulantly, jerking her head away\nfrom my hands, 'you've combed my hair quite out of curl!  That's enough;\nlet me alone.  What are you on the point of complaining about,\nHeathcliff?'\n\n'Nothing--only look at the almanack on that wall;' he pointed to a framed\nsheet hanging near the window, and continued, 'The crosses are for the\nevenings you have spent with the Lintons, the dots for those spent with\nme.  Do you see?  I've marked every day.'\n\n'Yes--very foolish: as if I took notice!' replied Catherine, in a peevish\ntone.  'And where is the sense of that?'\n\n'To show that I _do_ take notice,' said Heathcliff.\n\n'And should I always be sitting with you?' she demanded, growing more\nirritated.  'What good do I get?  What do you talk about?  You might be\ndumb, or a baby, for anything you say to amuse me, or for anything you\ndo, either!'\n\n'You never told me before that I talked too little, or that you disliked\nmy company, Cathy!' exclaimed Heathcliff, in much agitation.\n\n'It's no company at all, when people know nothing and say nothing,' she\nmuttered.\n\nHer companion rose up, but he hadn't time to express his feelings\nfurther, for a horse's feet were heard on the flags, and having knocked\ngently, young Linton entered, his face brilliant with delight at the\nunexpected summon she had received.  Doubtless Catherine marked the\ndifference between her friends, as one came in and the other went out.\nThe contrast resembled what you see in exchanging a bleak, hilly, coal\ncountry for a beautiful fertile valley; and his voice and greeting were\nas opposite as his aspect.  He had a sweet, low manner of speaking, and\npronounced his words as you do: that's less gruff than we talk here, and\nsofter.\n\n'I'm not come too soon, am I?' he said, casting a look at me: I had begun\nto wipe the plate, and tidy some drawers at the far end in the dresser.\n\n'No,' answered Catherine.  'What are you doing there, Nelly?'\n\n'My work, Miss,' I replied.  (Mr. Hindley had given me directions to make\na third party in any private visits Linton chose to pay.)\n\nShe stepped behind me and whispered crossly, 'Take yourself and your\ndusters off; when company are in the house, servants don't commence\nscouring and cleaning in the room where they are!'\n\n'It's a good opportunity, now that master is away,' I answered aloud: 'he\nhates me to be fidgeting over these things in his presence.  I'm sure Mr.\nEdgar will excuse me.'\n\n'I hate you to be fidgeting in _my_ presence,' exclaimed the young lady\nimperiously, not allowing her guest time to speak: she had failed to\nrecover her equanimity since the little dispute with Heathcliff.\n\n'I'm sorry for it, Miss Catherine,' was my response; and I proceeded\nassiduously with my occupation.\n\nShe, supposing Edgar could not see her, snatched the cloth from my hand,\nand pinched me, with a prolonged wrench, very spitefully on the arm.  I've\nsaid I did not love her, and rather relished mortifying her vanity now\nand then: besides, she hurt me extremely; so I started up from my knees,\nand screamed out, 'Oh, Miss, that's a nasty trick!  You have no right to\nnip me, and I'm not going to bear it.'\n\n'I didn't touch you, you lying creature!' cried she, her fingers tingling\nto repeat the act, and her ears red with rage.  She never had power to\nconceal her passion, it always set her whole complexion in a blaze.\n\n'What's that, then?' I retorted, showing a decided purple witness to\nrefute her.\n\nShe stamped her foot, wavered a moment, and then, irresistibly impelled\nby the naughty spirit within her, slapped me on the cheek: a stinging\nblow that filled both eyes with water.\n\n'Catherine, love!  Catherine!' interposed Linton, greatly shocked at the\ndouble fault of falsehood and violence which his idol had committed.\n\n'Leave the room, Ellen!' she repeated, trembling all over.\n\nLittle Hareton, who followed me everywhere, and was sitting near me on\nthe floor, at seeing my tears commenced crying himself, and sobbed out\ncomplaints against 'wicked aunt Cathy,' which drew her fury on to his\nunlucky head: she seized his shoulders, and shook him till the poor child\nwaxed livid, and Edgar thoughtlessly laid hold of her hands to deliver\nhim.  In an instant one was wrung free, and the astonished young man felt\nit applied over his own ear in a way that could not be mistaken for jest.\nHe drew back in consternation.  I lifted Hareton in my arms, and walked\noff to the kitchen with him, leaving the door of communication open, for\nI was curious to watch how they would settle their disagreement.  The\ninsulted visitor moved to the spot where he had laid his hat, pale and\nwith a quivering lip.\n\n'That's right!' I said to myself.  'Take warning and begone!  It's a\nkindness to let you have a glimpse of her genuine disposition.'\n\n'Where are you going?' demanded Catherine, advancing to the door.\n\nHe swerved aside, and attempted to pass.\n\n'You must not go!' she exclaimed, energetically.\n\n'I must and shall!' he replied in a subdued voice.\n\n'No,' she persisted, grasping the handle; 'not yet, Edgar Linton: sit\ndown; you shall not leave me in that temper.  I should be miserable all\nnight, and I won't be miserable for you!'\n\n'Can I stay after you have struck me?' asked Linton.\n\nCatherine was mute.\n\n'You've made me afraid and ashamed of you,' he continued; 'I'll not come\nhere again!'\n\nHer eyes began to glisten and her lids to twinkle.\n\n'And you told a deliberate untruth!' he said.\n\n'I didn't!' she cried, recovering her speech; 'I did nothing\ndeliberately.  Well, go, if you please--get away!  And now I'll cry--I'll\ncry myself sick!'\n\nShe dropped down on her knees by a chair, and set to weeping in serious\nearnest.  Edgar persevered in his resolution as far as the court; there\nhe lingered.  I resolved to encourage him.\n\n'Miss is dreadfully wayward, sir,' I called out.  'As bad as any marred\nchild: you'd better be riding home, or else she will be sick, only to\ngrieve us.'\n\nThe soft thing looked askance through the window: he possessed the power\nto depart as much as a cat possesses the power to leave a mouse half\nkilled, or a bird half eaten.  Ah, I thought, there will be no saving\nhim: he's doomed, and flies to his fate!  And so it was: he turned\nabruptly, hastened into the house again, shut the door behind him; and\nwhen I went in a while after to inform them that Earnshaw had come home\nrabid drunk, ready to pull the whole place about our ears (his ordinary\nframe of mind in that condition), I saw the quarrel had merely effected a\ncloser intimacy--had broken the outworks of youthful timidity, and\nenabled them to forsake the disguise of friendship, and confess\nthemselves lovers.\n\nIntelligence of Mr. Hindley's arrival drove Linton speedily to his horse,\nand Catherine to her chamber.  I went to hide little Hareton, and to take\nthe shot out of the master's fowling-piece, which he was fond of playing\nwith in his insane excitement, to the hazard of the lives of any who\nprovoked, or even attracted his notice too much; and I had hit upon the\nplan of removing it, that he might do less mischief if he did go the\nlength of firing the gun.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX\n\n\nHe entered, vociferating oaths dreadful to hear; and caught me in the act\nof stowing his son away in the kitchen cupboard.  Hareton was impressed\nwith a wholesome terror of encountering either his wild beast's fondness\nor his madman's rage; for in one he ran a chance of being squeezed and\nkissed to death, and in the other of being flung into the fire, or dashed\nagainst the wall; and the poor thing remained perfectly quiet wherever I\nchose to put him.\n\n'There, I've found it out at last!' cried Hindley, pulling me back by the\nskin of my neck, like a dog.  'By heaven and hell, you've sworn between\nyou to murder that child!  I know how it is, now, that he is always out\nof my way.  But, with the help of Satan, I shall make you swallow the\ncarving-knife, Nelly!  You needn't laugh; for I've just crammed Kenneth,\nhead-downmost, in the Black-horse marsh; and two is the same as one--and\nI want to kill some of you: I shall have no rest till I do!'\n\n'But I don't like the carving-knife, Mr. Hindley,' I answered; 'it has\nbeen cutting red herrings.  I'd rather be shot, if you please.'\n\n'You'd rather be damned!' he said; 'and so you shall.  No law in England\ncan hinder a man from keeping his house decent, and mine's abominable!\nOpen your mouth.'  He held the knife in his hand, and pushed its point\nbetween my teeth: but, for my part, I was never much afraid of his\nvagaries.  I spat out, and affirmed it tasted detestably--I would not\ntake it on any account.\n\n'Oh!' said he, releasing me, 'I see that hideous little villain is not\nHareton: I beg your pardon, Nell.  If it be, he deserves flaying alive\nfor not running to welcome me, and for screaming as if I were a goblin.\nUnnatural cub, come hither!  I'll teach thee to impose on a good-hearted,\ndeluded father.  Now, don't you think the lad would be handsomer cropped?\nIt makes a dog fiercer, and I love something fierce--get me a\nscissors--something fierce and trim!  Besides, it's infernal\naffectation--devilish conceit it is, to cherish our ears--we're asses\nenough without them.  Hush, child, hush!  Well then, it is my darling!\nwisht, dry thy eyes--there's a joy; kiss me.  What! it won't?  Kiss me,\nHareton!  Damn thee, kiss me!  By God, as if I would rear such a monster!\nAs sure as I'm living, I'll break the brat's neck.'\n\nPoor Hareton was squalling and kicking in his father's arms with all his\nmight, and redoubled his yells when he carried him up-stairs and lifted\nhim over the banister.  I cried out that he would frighten the child into\nfits, and ran to rescue him.  As I reached them, Hindley leant forward on\nthe rails to listen to a noise below; almost forgetting what he had in\nhis hands.  'Who is that?' he asked, hearing some one approaching the\nstairs'-foot.  I leant forward also, for the purpose of signing to\nHeathcliff, whose step I recognised, not to come further; and, at the\ninstant when my eye quitted Hareton, he gave a sudden spring, delivered\nhimself from the careless grasp that held him, and fell.\n\nThere was scarcely time to experience a thrill of horror before we saw\nthat the little wretch was safe.  Heathcliff arrived underneath just at\nthe critical moment; by a natural impulse he arrested his descent, and\nsetting him on his feet, looked up to discover the author of the\naccident.  A miser who has parted with a lucky lottery ticket for five\nshillings, and finds next day he has lost in the bargain five thousand\npounds, could not show a blanker countenance than he did on beholding the\nfigure of Mr. Earnshaw above.  It expressed, plainer than words could do,\nthe intensest anguish at having made himself the instrument of thwarting\nhis own revenge.  Had it been dark, I daresay he would have tried to\nremedy the mistake by smashing Hareton's skull on the steps; but, we\nwitnessed his salvation; and I was presently below with my precious\ncharge pressed to my heart.  Hindley descended more leisurely, sobered\nand abashed.\n\n'It is your fault, Ellen,' he said; 'you should have kept him out of\nsight: you should have taken him from me!  Is he injured anywhere?'\n\n'Injured!' I cried angrily; 'if he is not killed, he'll be an idiot!  Oh!\nI wonder his mother does not rise from her grave to see how you use him.\nYou're worse than a heathen--treating your own flesh and blood in that\nmanner!'  He attempted to touch the child, who, on finding himself with\nme, sobbed off his terror directly.  At the first finger his father laid\non him, however, he shrieked again louder than before, and struggled as\nif he would go into convulsions.\n\n'You shall not meddle with him!' I continued.  'He hates you--they all\nhate you--that's the truth!  A happy family you have; and a pretty state\nyou're come to!'\n\n'I shall come to a prettier, yet, Nelly,' laughed the misguided man,\nrecovering his hardness.  'At present, convey yourself and him away.  And\nhark you, Heathcliff! clear you too quite from my reach and hearing.  I\nwouldn't murder you to-night; unless, perhaps, I set the house on fire:\nbut that's as my fancy goes.'\n\nWhile saying this he took a pint bottle of brandy from the dresser, and\npoured some into a tumbler.\n\n'Nay, don't!' I entreated.  'Mr. Hindley, do take warning.  Have mercy on\nthis unfortunate boy, if you care nothing for yourself!'\n\n'Any one will do better for him than I shall,' he answered.\n\n'Have mercy on your own soul!' I said, endeavouring to snatch the glass\nfrom his hand.\n\n'Not I!  On the contrary, I shall have great pleasure in sending it to\nperdition to punish its Maker,' exclaimed the blasphemer.  'Here's to its\nhearty damnation!'\n\nHe drank the spirits and impatiently bade us go; terminating his command\nwith a sequel of horrid imprecations too bad to repeat or remember.\n\n'It's a pity he cannot kill himself with drink,' observed Heathcliff,\nmuttering an echo of curses back when the door was shut.  'He's doing his\nvery utmost; but his constitution defies him.  Mr. Kenneth says he would\nwager his mare that he'll outlive any man on this side Gimmerton, and go\nto the grave a hoary sinner; unless some happy chance out of the common\ncourse befall him.'\n\nI went into the kitchen, and sat down to lull my little lamb to sleep.\nHeathcliff, as I thought, walked through to the barn.  It turned out\nafterwards that he only got as far as the other side the settle, when he\nflung himself on a bench by the wall, removed from the fire and remained\nsilent.\n\nI was rocking Hareton on my knee, and humming a song that began,--\n\n   It was far in the night, and the bairnies grat,\n   The mither beneath the mools heard that,\n\nwhen Miss Cathy, who had listened to the hubbub from her room, put her\nhead in, and whispered,--'Are you alone, Nelly?'\n\n'Yes, Miss,' I replied.\n\nShe entered and approached the hearth.  I, supposing she was going to say\nsomething, looked up.  The expression of her face seemed disturbed and\nanxious.  Her lips were half asunder, as if she meant to speak, and she\ndrew a breath; but it escaped in a sigh instead of a sentence.  I resumed\nmy song; not having forgotten her recent behaviour.\n\n'Where's Heathcliff?' she said, interrupting me.\n\n'About his work in the stable,' was my answer.\n\nHe did not contradict me; perhaps he had fallen into a doze.  There\nfollowed another long pause, during which I perceived a drop or two\ntrickle from Catherine's cheek to the flags.  Is she sorry for her\nshameful conduct?--I asked myself.  That will be a novelty: but she may\ncome to the point--as she will--I sha'n't help her!  No, she felt small\ntrouble regarding any subject, save her own concerns.\n\n'Oh, dear!' she cried at last.  'I'm very unhappy!'\n\n'A pity,' observed I.  'You're hard to please; so many friends and so few\ncares, and can't make yourself content!'\n\n'Nelly, will you keep a secret for me?' she pursued, kneeling down by me,\nand lifting her winsome eyes to my face with that sort of look which\nturns off bad temper, even when one has all the right in the world to\nindulge it.\n\n'Is it worth keeping?' I inquired, less sulkily.\n\n'Yes, and it worries me, and I must let it out!  I want to know what I\nshould do.  To-day, Edgar Linton has asked me to marry him, and I've\ngiven him an answer.  Now, before I tell you whether it was a consent or\ndenial, you tell me which it ought to have been.'\n\n'Really, Miss Catherine, how can I know?' I replied.  'To be sure,\nconsidering the exhibition you performed in his presence this afternoon,\nI might say it would be wise to refuse him: since he asked you after\nthat, he must either be hopelessly stupid or a venturesome fool.'\n\n'If you talk so, I won't tell you any more,' she returned, peevishly\nrising to her feet.  'I accepted him, Nelly.  Be quick, and say whether I\nwas wrong!'\n\n'You accepted him!  Then what good is it discussing the matter?  You have\npledged your word, and cannot retract.'\n\n'But say whether I should have done so--do!' she exclaimed in an\nirritated tone; chafing her hands together, and frowning.\n\n'There are many things to be considered before that question can be\nanswered properly,' I said, sententiously.  'First and foremost, do you\nlove Mr. Edgar?'\n\n'Who can help it?  Of course I do,' she answered.\n\nThen I put her through the following catechism: for a girl of twenty-two\nit was not injudicious.\n\n'Why do you love him, Miss Cathy?'\n\n'Nonsense, I do--that's sufficient.'\n\n'By no means; you must say why?'\n\n'Well, because he is handsome, and pleasant to be with.'\n\n'Bad!' was my commentary.\n\n'And because he is young and cheerful.'\n\n'Bad, still.'\n\n'And because he loves me.'\n\n'Indifferent, coming there.'\n\n'And he will be rich, and I shall like to be the greatest woman of the\nneighbourhood, and I shall be proud of having such a husband.'\n\n'Worst of all.  And now, say how you love him?'\n\n'As everybody loves--You're silly, Nelly.'\n\n'Not at all--Answer.'\n\n'I love the ground under his feet, and the air over his head, and\neverything he touches, and every word he says.  I love all his looks, and\nall his actions, and him entirely and altogether.  There now!'\n\n'And why?'\n\n'Nay; you are making a jest of it: it is exceedingly ill-natured!  It's\nno jest to me!' said the young lady, scowling, and turning her face to\nthe fire.\n\n'I'm very far from jesting, Miss Catherine,' I replied.  'You love Mr.\nEdgar because he is handsome, and young, and cheerful, and rich, and\nloves you.  The last, however, goes for nothing: you would love him\nwithout that, probably; and with it you wouldn't, unless he possessed the\nfour former attractions.'\n\n'No, to be sure not: I should only pity him--hate him, perhaps, if he\nwere ugly, and a clown.'\n\n'But there are several other handsome, rich young men in the world:\nhandsomer, possibly, and richer than he is.  What should hinder you from\nloving them?'\n\n'If there be any, they are out of my way: I've seen none like Edgar.'\n\n'You may see some; and he won't always be handsome, and young, and may\nnot always be rich.'\n\n'He is now; and I have only to do with the present.  I wish you would\nspeak rationally.'\n\n'Well, that settles it: if you have only to do with the present, marry\nMr. Linton.'\n\n'I don't want your permission for that--I _shall_ marry him: and yet you\nhave not told me whether I'm right.'\n\n'Perfectly right; if people be right to marry only for the present.  And\nnow, let us hear what you are unhappy about.  Your brother will be\npleased; the old lady and gentleman will not object, I think; you will\nescape from a disorderly, comfortless home into a wealthy, respectable\none; and you love Edgar, and Edgar loves you.  All seems smooth and easy:\nwhere is the obstacle?'\n\n'_Here_! and _here_!' replied Catherine, striking one hand on her\nforehead, and the other on her breast: 'in whichever place the soul\nlives.  In my soul and in my heart, I'm convinced I'm wrong!'\n\n'That's very strange!  I cannot make it out.'\n\n'It's my secret.  But if you will not mock at me, I'll explain it: I\ncan't do it distinctly; but I'll give you a feeling of how I feel.'\n\nShe seated herself by me again: her countenance grew sadder and graver,\nand her clasped hands trembled.\n\n'Nelly, do you never dream queer dreams?' she said, suddenly, after some\nminutes' reflection.\n\n'Yes, now and then,' I answered.\n\n'And so do I.  I've dreamt in my life dreams that have stayed with me\never after, and changed my ideas: they've gone through and through me,\nlike wine through water, and altered the colour of my mind.  And this is\none: I'm going to tell it--but take care not to smile at any part of it.'\n\n'Oh! don't, Miss Catherine!' I cried.  'We're dismal enough without\nconjuring up ghosts and visions to perplex us.  Come, come, be merry and\nlike yourself!  Look at little Hareton! _he's_ dreaming nothing dreary.\nHow sweetly he smiles in his sleep!'\n\n'Yes; and how sweetly his father curses in his solitude!  You remember\nhim, I daresay, when he was just such another as that chubby thing:\nnearly as young and innocent.  However, Nelly, I shall oblige you to\nlisten: it's not long; and I've no power to be merry to-night.'\n\n'I won't hear it, I won't hear it!' I repeated, hastily.\n\nI was superstitious about dreams then, and am still; and Catherine had an\nunusual gloom in her aspect, that made me dread something from which I\nmight shape a prophecy, and foresee a fearful catastrophe.  She was\nvexed, but she did not proceed.  Apparently taking up another subject,\nshe recommenced in a short time.\n\n'If I were in heaven, Nelly, I should be extremely miserable.'\n\n'Because you are not fit to go there,' I answered.  'All sinners would be\nmiserable in heaven.'\n\n'But it is not for that.  I dreamt once that I was there.'\n\n'I tell you I won't hearken to your dreams, Miss Catherine!  I'll go to\nbed,' I interrupted again.\n\nShe laughed, and held me down; for I made a motion to leave my chair.\n\n'This is nothing,' cried she: 'I was only going to say that heaven did\nnot seem to be my home; and I broke my heart with weeping to come back to\nearth; and the angels were so angry that they flung me out into the\nmiddle of the heath on the top of Wuthering Heights; where I woke sobbing\nfor joy.  That will do to explain my secret, as well as the other.  I've\nno more business to marry Edgar Linton than I have to be in heaven; and\nif the wicked man in there had not brought Heathcliff so low, I shouldn't\nhave thought of it.  It would degrade me to marry Heathcliff now; so he\nshall never know how I love him: and that, not because he's handsome,\nNelly, but because he's more myself than I am.  Whatever our souls are\nmade of, his and mine are the same; and Linton's is as different as a\nmoonbeam from lightning, or frost from fire.'\n\nEre this speech ended I became sensible of Heathcliff's presence.  Having\nnoticed a slight movement, I turned my head, and saw him rise from the\nbench, and steal out noiselessly.  He had listened till he heard\nCatherine say it would degrade her to marry him, and then he stayed to\nhear no further.  My companion, sitting on the ground, was prevented by\nthe back of the settle from remarking his presence or departure; but I\nstarted, and bade her hush!\n\n'Why?' she asked, gazing nervously round.\n\n'Joseph is here,' I answered, catching opportunely the roll of his\ncartwheels up the road; 'and Heathcliff will come in with him.  I'm not\nsure whether he were not at the door this moment.'\n\n'Oh, he couldn't overhear me at the door!' said she.  'Give me Hareton,\nwhile you get the supper, and when it is ready ask me to sup with you.  I\nwant to cheat my uncomfortable conscience, and be convinced that\nHeathcliff has no notion of these things.  He has not, has he?  He does\nnot know what being in love is!'\n\n'I see no reason that he should not know, as well as you,' I returned;\n'and if you are his choice, he'll be the most unfortunate creature that\never was born!  As soon as you become Mrs. Linton, he loses friend, and\nlove, and all!  Have you considered how you'll bear the separation, and\nhow he'll bear to be quite deserted in the world?  Because, Miss\nCatherine--'\n\n'He quite deserted! we separated!' she exclaimed, with an accent of\nindignation.  'Who is to separate us, pray?  They'll meet the fate of\nMilo!  Not as long as I live, Ellen: for no mortal creature.  Every\nLinton on the face of the earth might melt into nothing before I could\nconsent to forsake Heathcliff.  Oh, that's not what I intend--that's not\nwhat I mean!  I shouldn't be Mrs. Linton were such a price demanded!\nHe'll be as much to me as he has been all his lifetime.  Edgar must shake\noff his antipathy, and tolerate him, at least.  He will, when he learns\nmy true feelings towards him.  Nelly, I see now you think me a selfish\nwretch; but did it never strike you that if Heathcliff and I married, we\nshould be beggars? whereas, if I marry Linton I can aid Heathcliff to\nrise, and place him out of my brother's power.'\n\n'With your husband's money, Miss Catherine?' I asked.  'You'll find him\nnot so pliable as you calculate upon: and, though I'm hardly a judge, I\nthink that's the worst motive you've given yet for being the wife of\nyoung Linton.'\n\n'It is not,' retorted she; 'it is the best!  The others were the\nsatisfaction of my whims: and for Edgar's sake, too, to satisfy him.  This\nis for the sake of one who comprehends in his person my feelings to Edgar\nand myself.  I cannot express it; but surely you and everybody have a\nnotion that there is or should be an existence of yours beyond you.  What\nwere the use of my creation, if I were entirely contained here?  My great\nmiseries in this world have been Heathcliff's miseries, and I watched and\nfelt each from the beginning: my great thought in living is himself.  If\nall else perished, and _he_ remained, _I_ should still continue to be;\nand if all else remained, and he were annihilated, the universe would\nturn to a mighty stranger: I should not seem a part of it.--My love for\nLinton is like the foliage in the woods: time will change it, I'm well\naware, as winter changes the trees.  My love for Heathcliff resembles the\neternal rocks beneath: a source of little visible delight, but necessary.\nNelly, I _am_ Heathcliff!  He's always, always in my mind: not as a\npleasure, any more than I am always a pleasure to myself, but as my own\nbeing.  So don't talk of our separation again: it is impracticable; and--'\n\nShe paused, and hid her face in the folds of my gown; but I jerked it\nforcibly away.  I was out of patience with her folly!\n\n'If I can make any sense of your nonsense, Miss,' I said, 'it only goes\nto convince me that you are ignorant of the duties you undertake in\nmarrying; or else that you are a wicked, unprincipled girl.  But trouble\nme with no more secrets: I'll not promise to keep them.'\n\n'You'll keep that?' she asked, eagerly.\n\n'No, I'll not promise,' I repeated.\n\nShe was about to insist, when the entrance of Joseph finished our\nconversation; and Catherine removed her seat to a corner, and nursed\nHareton, while I made the supper.  After it was cooked, my fellow-servant\nand I began to quarrel who should carry some to Mr. Hindley; and we\ndidn't settle it till all was nearly cold.  Then we came to the agreement\nthat we would let him ask, if he wanted any; for we feared particularly\nto go into his presence when he had been some time alone.\n\n'And how isn't that nowt comed in fro' th' field, be this time?  What is\nhe about? girt idle seeght!' demanded the old man, looking round for\nHeathcliff.\n\n'I'll call him,' I replied.  'He's in the barn, I've no doubt.'\n\nI went and called, but got no answer.  On returning, I whispered to\nCatherine that he had heard a good part of what she said, I was sure; and\ntold how I saw him quit the kitchen just as she complained of her\nbrother's conduct regarding him.  She jumped up in a fine fright, flung\nHareton on to the settle, and ran to seek for her friend herself; not\ntaking leisure to consider why she was so flurried, or how her talk would\nhave affected him.  She was absent such a while that Joseph proposed we\nshould wait no longer.  He cunningly conjectured they were staying away\nin order to avoid hearing his protracted blessing.  They were 'ill eneugh\nfor ony fahl manners,' he affirmed.  And on their behalf he added that\nnight a special prayer to the usual quarter-of-an-hour's supplication\nbefore meat, and would have tacked another to the end of the grace, had\nnot his young mistress broken in upon him with a hurried command that he\nmust run down the road, and, wherever Heathcliff had rambled, find and\nmake him re-enter directly!\n\n'I want to speak to him, and I _must_, before I go upstairs,' she said.\n'And the gate is open: he is somewhere out of hearing; for he would not\nreply, though I shouted at the top of the fold as loud as I could.'\n\nJoseph objected at first; she was too much in earnest, however, to suffer\ncontradiction; and at last he placed his hat on his head, and walked\ngrumbling forth.  Meantime, Catherine paced up and down the floor,\nexclaiming--'I wonder where he is--I wonder where he can be!  What did I\nsay, Nelly?  I've forgotten.  Was he vexed at my bad humour this\nafternoon?  Dear! tell me what I've said to grieve him?  I do wish he'd\ncome.  I do wish he would!'\n\n'What a noise for nothing!' I cried, though rather uneasy myself.  'What\na trifle scares you!  It's surely no great cause of alarm that Heathcliff\nshould take a moonlight saunter on the moors, or even lie too sulky to\nspeak to us in the hay-loft.  I'll engage he's lurking there.  See if I\ndon't ferret him out!'\n\nI departed to renew my search; its result was disappointment, and\nJoseph's quest ended in the same.\n\n'Yon lad gets war und war!' observed he on re-entering.  'He's left th'\ngate at t' full swing, and Miss's pony has trodden dahn two rigs o' corn,\nand plottered through, raight o'er into t' meadow!  Hahsomdiver, t'\nmaister 'ull play t' devil to-morn, and he'll do weel.  He's patience\nitsseln wi' sich careless, offald craters--patience itsseln he is!  Bud\nhe'll not be soa allus--yah's see, all on ye!  Yah mun'n't drive him out\nof his heead for nowt!'\n\n'Have you found Heathcliff, you ass?' interrupted Catherine.  'Have you\nbeen looking for him, as I ordered?'\n\n'I sud more likker look for th' horse,' he replied.  'It 'ud be to more\nsense.  Bud I can look for norther horse nur man of a neeght loike\nthis--as black as t' chimbley! und Heathcliff's noan t' chap to coom at\n_my_ whistle--happen he'll be less hard o' hearing wi' _ye_!'\n\nIt _was_ a very dark evening for summer: the clouds appeared inclined to\nthunder, and I said we had better all sit down; the approaching rain\nwould be certain to bring him home without further trouble.  However,\nCatherine would not be persuaded into tranquillity.  She kept wandering\nto and fro, from the gate to the door, in a state of agitation which\npermitted no repose; and at length took up a permanent situation on one\nside of the wall, near the road: where, heedless of my expostulations and\nthe growling thunder, and the great drops that began to plash around her,\nshe remained, calling at intervals, and then listening, and then crying\noutright.  She beat Hareton, or any child, at a good passionate fit of\ncrying.\n\nAbout midnight, while we still sat up, the storm came rattling over the\nHeights in full fury.  There was a violent wind, as well as thunder, and\neither one or the other split a tree off at the corner of the building: a\nhuge bough fell across the roof, and knocked down a portion of the east\nchimney-stack, sending a clatter of stones and soot into the\nkitchen-fire.  We thought a bolt had fallen in the middle of us; and\nJoseph swung on to his knees, beseeching the Lord to remember the\npatriarchs Noah and Lot, and, as in former times, spare the righteous,\nthough he smote the ungodly.  I felt some sentiment that it must be a\njudgment on us also.  The Jonah, in my mind, was Mr. Earnshaw; and I\nshook the handle of his den that I might ascertain if he were yet living.\nHe replied audibly enough, in a fashion which made my companion\nvociferate, more clamorously than before, that a wide distinction might\nbe drawn between saints like himself and sinners like his master.  But\nthe uproar passed away in twenty minutes, leaving us all unharmed;\nexcepting Cathy, who got thoroughly drenched for her obstinacy in\nrefusing to take shelter, and standing bonnetless and shawlless to catch\nas much water as she could with her hair and clothes.  She came in and\nlay down on the settle, all soaked as she was, turning her face to the\nback, and putting her hands before it.\n\n'Well, Miss!' I exclaimed, touching her shoulder; 'you are not bent on\ngetting your death, are you?  Do you know what o'clock it is?  Half-past\ntwelve.  Come, come to bed! there's no use waiting any longer on that\nfoolish boy: he'll be gone to Gimmerton, and he'll stay there now.  He\nguesses we shouldn't wait for him till this late hour: at least, he\nguesses that only Mr. Hindley would be up; and he'd rather avoid having\nthe door opened by the master.'\n\n'Nay, nay, he's noan at Gimmerton,' said Joseph.  'I's niver wonder but\nhe's at t' bothom of a bog-hoile.  This visitation worn't for nowt, and I\nwod hev' ye to look out, Miss--yah muh be t' next.  Thank Hivin for all!\nAll warks togither for gooid to them as is chozzen, and piked out fro'\nth' rubbidge!  Yah knaw whet t' Scripture ses.'  And he began quoting\nseveral texts, referring us to chapters and verses where we might find\nthem.\n\nI, having vainly begged the wilful girl to rise and remove her wet\nthings, left him preaching and her shivering, and betook myself to bed\nwith little Hareton, who slept as fast as if everyone had been sleeping\nround him.  I heard Joseph read on a while afterwards; then I\ndistinguished his slow step on the ladder, and then I dropped asleep.\n\nComing down somewhat later than usual, I saw, by the sunbeams piercing\nthe chinks of the shutters, Miss Catherine still seated near the\nfireplace.  The house-door was ajar, too; light entered from its unclosed\nwindows; Hindley had come out, and stood on the kitchen hearth, haggard\nand drowsy.\n\n'What ails you, Cathy?' he was saying when I entered: 'you look as dismal\nas a drowned whelp.  Why are you so damp and pale, child?'\n\n'I've been wet,' she answered reluctantly, 'and I'm cold, that's all.'\n\n'Oh, she is naughty!' I cried, perceiving the master to be tolerably\nsober.  'She got steeped in the shower of yesterday evening, and there\nshe has sat the night through, and I couldn't prevail on her to stir.'\n\nMr. Earnshaw stared at us in surprise.  'The night through,' he repeated.\n'What kept her up? not fear of the thunder, surely?  That was over hours\nsince.'\n\nNeither of us wished to mention Heathcliff's absence, as long as we could\nconceal it; so I replied, I didn't know how she took it into her head to\nsit up; and she said nothing.  The morning was fresh and cool; I threw\nback the lattice, and presently the room filled with sweet scents from\nthe garden; but Catherine called peevishly to me, 'Ellen, shut the\nwindow.  I'm starving!'  And her teeth chattered as she shrank closer to\nthe almost extinguished embers.\n\n'She's ill,' said Hindley, taking her wrist; 'I suppose that's the reason\nshe would not go to bed.  Damn it!  I don't want to be troubled with more\nsickness here.  What took you into the rain?'\n\n'Running after t' lads, as usuald!' croaked Joseph, catching an\nopportunity from our hesitation to thrust in his evil tongue.  'If I war\nyah, maister, I'd just slam t' boards i' their faces all on 'em, gentle\nand simple!  Never a day ut yah're off, but yon cat o' Linton comes\nsneaking hither; and Miss Nelly, shoo's a fine lass! shoo sits watching\nfor ye i' t' kitchen; and as yah're in at one door, he's out at t'other;\nand, then, wer grand lady goes a-courting of her side!  It's bonny\nbehaviour, lurking amang t' fields, after twelve o' t' night, wi' that\nfahl, flaysome divil of a gipsy, Heathcliff!  They think _I'm_ blind; but\nI'm noan: nowt ut t' soart!--I seed young Linton boath coming and going,\nand I seed _yah_' (directing his discourse to me), 'yah gooid fur nowt,\nslattenly witch! nip up and bolt into th' house, t' minute yah heard t'\nmaister's horse-fit clatter up t' road.'\n\n'Silence, eavesdropper!' cried Catherine; 'none of your insolence before\nme!  Edgar Linton came yesterday by chance, Hindley; and it was _I_ who\ntold him to be off: because I knew you would not like to have met him as\nyou were.'\n\n'You lie, Cathy, no doubt,' answered her brother, 'and you are a\nconfounded simpleton!  But never mind Linton at present: tell me, were\nyou not with Heathcliff last night?  Speak the truth, now.  You need not\nbe afraid of harming him: though I hate him as much as ever, he did me a\ngood turn a short time since that will make my conscience tender of\nbreaking his neck.  To prevent it, I shall send him about his business\nthis very morning; and after he's gone, I'd advise you all to look sharp:\nI shall only have the more humour for you.'\n\n'I never saw Heathcliff last night,' answered Catherine, beginning to sob\nbitterly: 'and if you do turn him out of doors, I'll go with him.  But,\nperhaps, you'll never have an opportunity: perhaps, he's gone.'  Here she\nburst into uncontrollable grief, and the remainder of her words were\ninarticulate.\n\nHindley lavished on her a torrent of scornful abuse, and bade her get to\nher room immediately, or she shouldn't cry for nothing!  I obliged her to\nobey; and I shall never forget what a scene she acted when we reached her\nchamber: it terrified me.  I thought she was going mad, and I begged\nJoseph to run for the doctor.  It proved the commencement of delirium:\nMr. Kenneth, as soon as he saw her, pronounced her dangerously ill; she\nhad a fever.  He bled her, and he told me to let her live on whey and\nwater-gruel, and take care she did not throw herself downstairs or out of\nthe window; and then he left: for he had enough to do in the parish,\nwhere two or three miles was the ordinary distance between cottage and\ncottage.\n\nThough I cannot say I made a gentle nurse, and Joseph and the master were\nno better, and though our patient was as wearisome and headstrong as a\npatient could be, she weathered it through.  Old Mrs. Linton paid us\nseveral visits, to be sure, and set things to rights, and scolded and\nordered us all; and when Catherine was convalescent, she insisted on\nconveying her to Thrushcross Grange: for which deliverance we were very\ngrateful.  But the poor dame had reason to repent of her kindness: she\nand her husband both took the fever, and died within a few days of each\nother.\n\nOur young lady returned to us saucier and more passionate, and haughtier\nthan ever.  Heathcliff had never been heard of since the evening of the\nthunder-storm; and, one day, I had the misfortune, when she had provoked\nme exceedingly, to lay the blame of his disappearance on her: where\nindeed it belonged, as she well knew.  From that period, for several\nmonths, she ceased to hold any communication with me, save in the\nrelation of a mere servant.  Joseph fell under a ban also: he would speak\nhis mind, and lecture her all the same as if she were a little girl; and\nshe esteemed herself a woman, and our mistress, and thought that her\nrecent illness gave her a claim to be treated with consideration.  Then\nthe doctor had said that she would not bear crossing much; she ought to\nhave her own way; and it was nothing less than murder in her eyes for any\none to presume to stand up and contradict her.  From Mr. Earnshaw and his\ncompanions she kept aloof; and tutored by Kenneth, and serious threats of\na fit that often attended her rages, her brother allowed her whatever she\npleased to demand, and generally avoided aggravating her fiery temper.  He\nwas rather too indulgent in humouring her caprices; not from affection,\nbut from pride: he wished earnestly to see her bring honour to the family\nby an alliance with the Lintons, and as long as she let him alone she\nmight trample on us like slaves, for aught he cared!  Edgar Linton, as\nmultitudes have been before and will be after him, was infatuated: and\nbelieved himself the happiest man alive on the day he led her to\nGimmerton Chapel, three years subsequent to his father's death.\n\nMuch against my inclination, I was persuaded to leave Wuthering Heights\nand accompany her here. Little Hareton was nearly five years old, and I\nhad just begun to teach him his letters.  We made a sad parting; but\nCatherine's tears were more powerful than ours.  When I refused to go,\nand when she found her entreaties did not move me, she went lamenting to\nher husband and brother.  The former offered me munificent wages; the\nlatter ordered me to pack up: he wanted no women in the house, he said,\nnow that there was no mistress; and as to Hareton, the curate should take\nhim in hand, by-and-by.  And so I had but one choice left: to do as I was\nordered.  I told the master he got rid of all decent people only to run\nto ruin a little faster; I kissed Hareton, said good-by; and since then\nhe has been a stranger: and it's very queer to think it, but I've no\ndoubt he has completely forgotten all about Ellen Dean, and that he was\never more than all the world to her and she to him!\n\n* * * * *\n\nAt this point of the housekeeper's story she chanced to glance towards\nthe time-piece over the chimney; and was in amazement on seeing the\nminute-hand measure half-past one.  She would not hear of staying a\nsecond longer: in truth, I felt rather disposed to defer the sequel of\nher narrative myself.  And now that she is vanished to her rest, and I\nhave meditated for another hour or two, I shall summon courage to go\nalso, in spite of aching laziness of head and limbs.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X\n\n\nA charming introduction to a hermit's life!  Four weeks' torture,\ntossing, and sickness!  Oh, these bleak winds and bitter northern skies,\nand impassable roads, and dilatory country surgeons!  And oh, this dearth\nof the human physiognomy! and, worse than all, the terrible intimation of\nKenneth that I need not expect to be out of doors till spring!\n\nMr. Heathcliff has just honoured me with a call.  About seven days ago he\nsent me a brace of grouse--the last of the season.  Scoundrel!  He is not\naltogether guiltless in this illness of mine; and that I had a great mind\nto tell him.  But, alas! how could I offend a man who was charitable\nenough to sit at my bedside a good hour, and talk on some other subject\nthan pills and draughts, blisters and leeches?  This is quite an easy\ninterval.  I am too weak to read; yet I feel as if I could enjoy\nsomething interesting.  Why not have up Mrs. Dean to finish her tale?  I\ncan recollect its chief incidents, as far as she had gone.  Yes: I\nremember her hero had run off, and never been heard of for three years;\nand the heroine was married.  I'll ring: she'll be delighted to find me\ncapable of talking cheerfully.  Mrs. Dean came.\n\n'It wants twenty minutes, sir, to taking the medicine,' she commenced.\n\n'Away, away with it!' I replied; 'I desire to have--'\n\n'The doctor says you must drop the powders.'\n\n'With all my heart!  Don't interrupt me.  Come and take your seat here.\nKeep your fingers from that bitter phalanx of vials.  Draw your knitting\nout of your pocket--that will do--now continue the history of Mr.\nHeathcliff, from where you left off, to the present day.  Did he finish\nhis education on the Continent, and come back a gentleman? or did he get\na sizar's place at college, or escape to America, and earn honours by\ndrawing blood from his foster-country? or make a fortune more promptly on\nthe English highways?'\n\n'He may have done a little in all these vocations, Mr. Lockwood; but I\ncouldn't give my word for any.  I stated before that I didn't know how he\ngained his money; neither am I aware of the means he took to raise his\nmind from the savage ignorance into which it was sunk: but, with your\nleave, I'll proceed in my own fashion, if you think it will amuse and not\nweary you.  Are you feeling better this morning?'\n\n'Much.'\n\n'That's good news.'\n\n* * * * *\n\nI got Miss Catherine and myself to Thrushcross Grange; and, to my\nagreeable disappointment, she behaved infinitely better than I dared to\nexpect.  She seemed almost over-fond of Mr. Linton; and even to his\nsister she showed plenty of affection.  They were both very attentive to\nher comfort, certainly.  It was not the thorn bending to the\nhoneysuckles, but the honeysuckles embracing the thorn.  There were no\nmutual concessions: one stood erect, and the others yielded: and who can\nbe ill-natured and bad-tempered when they encounter neither opposition\nnor indifference?  I observed that Mr. Edgar had a deep-rooted fear of\nruffling her humour.  He concealed it from her; but if ever he heard me\nanswer sharply, or saw any other servant grow cloudy at some imperious\norder of hers, he would show his trouble by a frown of displeasure that\nnever darkened on his own account.  He many a time spoke sternly to me\nabout my pertness; and averred that the stab of a knife could not inflict\na worse pang than he suffered at seeing his lady vexed.  Not to grieve a\nkind master, I learned to be less touchy; and, for the space of half a\nyear, the gunpowder lay as harmless as sand, because no fire came near to\nexplode it.  Catherine had seasons of gloom and silence now and then:\nthey were respected with sympathising silence by her husband, who\nascribed them to an alteration in her constitution, produced by her\nperilous illness; as she was never subject to depression of spirits\nbefore.  The return of sunshine was welcomed by answering sunshine from\nhim.  I believe I may assert that they were really in possession of deep\nand growing happiness.\n\nIt ended.  Well, we _must_ be for ourselves in the long run; the mild and\ngenerous are only more justly selfish than the domineering; and it ended\nwhen circumstances caused each to feel that the one's interest was not\nthe chief consideration in the other's thoughts.  On a mellow evening in\nSeptember, I was coming from the garden with a heavy basket of apples\nwhich I had been gathering.  It had got dusk, and the moon looked over\nthe high wall of the court, causing undefined shadows to lurk in the\ncorners of the numerous projecting portions of the building.  I set my\nburden on the house-steps by the kitchen-door, and lingered to rest, and\ndrew in a few more breaths of the soft, sweet air; my eyes were on the\nmoon, and my back to the entrance, when I heard a voice behind me\nsay,--'Nelly, is that you?'\n\nIt was a deep voice, and foreign in tone; yet there was something in the\nmanner of pronouncing my name which made it sound familiar.  I turned\nabout to discover who spoke, fearfully; for the doors were shut, and I\nhad seen nobody on approaching the steps.  Something stirred in the\nporch; and, moving nearer, I distinguished a tall man dressed in dark\nclothes, with dark face and hair.  He leant against the side, and held\nhis fingers on the latch as if intending to open for himself.  'Who can\nit be?' I thought.  'Mr. Earnshaw?  Oh, no!  The voice has no resemblance\nto his.'\n\n'I have waited here an hour,' he resumed, while I continued staring; 'and\nthe whole of that time all round has been as still as death.  I dared not\nenter.  You do not know me?  Look, I'm not a stranger!'\n\nA ray fell on his features; the cheeks were sallow, and half covered with\nblack whiskers; the brows lowering, the eyes deep-set and singular.  I\nremembered the eyes.\n\n'What!' I cried, uncertain whether to regard him as a worldly visitor,\nand I raised my hands in amazement.  'What! you come back?  Is it really\nyou?  Is it?'\n\n'Yes, Heathcliff,' he replied, glancing from me up to the windows, which\nreflected a score of glittering moons, but showed no lights from within.\n'Are they at home? where is she?  Nelly, you are not glad! you needn't be\nso disturbed.  Is she here?  Speak!  I want to have one word with\nher--your mistress.  Go, and say some person from Gimmerton desires to\nsee her.'\n\n'How will she take it?' I exclaimed.  'What will she do?  The surprise\nbewilders me--it will put her out of her head!  And you _are_ Heathcliff!\nBut altered!  Nay, there's no comprehending it.  Have you been for a\nsoldier?'\n\n'Go and carry my message,' he interrupted, impatiently.  'I'm in hell\ntill you do!'\n\nHe lifted the latch, and I entered; but when I got to the parlour where\nMr. and Mrs. Linton were, I could not persuade myself to proceed.  At\nlength I resolved on making an excuse to ask if they would have the\ncandles lighted, and I opened the door.\n\nThey sat together in a window whose lattice lay back against the wall,\nand displayed, beyond the garden trees, and the wild green park, the\nvalley of Gimmerton, with a long line of mist winding nearly to its top\n(for very soon after you pass the chapel, as you may have noticed, the\nsough that runs from the marshes joins a beck which follows the bend of\nthe glen).  Wuthering Heights rose above this silvery vapour; but our old\nhouse was invisible; it rather dips down on the other side.  Both the\nroom and its occupants, and the scene they gazed on, looked wondrously\npeaceful.  I shrank reluctantly from performing my errand; and was\nactually going away leaving it unsaid, after having put my question about\nthe candles, when a sense of my folly compelled me to return, and mutter,\n'A person from Gimmerton wishes to see you ma'am.'\n\n'What does he want?' asked Mrs. Linton.\n\n'I did not question him,' I answered.\n\n'Well, close the curtains, Nelly,' she said; 'and bring up tea.  I'll be\nback again directly.'\n\nShe quitted the apartment; Mr. Edgar inquired, carelessly, who it was.\n\n'Some one mistress does not expect,' I replied.  'That Heathcliff--you\nrecollect him, sir--who used to live at Mr. Earnshaw's.'\n\n'What! the gipsy--the ploughboy?' he cried.  'Why did you not say so to\nCatherine?'\n\n'Hush! you must not call him by those names, master,' I said.  'She'd be\nsadly grieved to hear you.  She was nearly heartbroken when he ran off.  I\nguess his return will make a jubilee to her.'\n\nMr. Linton walked to a window on the other side of the room that\noverlooked the court.  He unfastened it, and leant out.  I suppose they\nwere below, for he exclaimed quickly: 'Don't stand there, love!  Bring\nthe person in, if it be anyone particular.'  Ere long, I heard the click\nof the latch, and Catherine flew up-stairs, breathless and wild; too\nexcited to show gladness: indeed, by her face, you would rather have\nsurmised an awful calamity.\n\n'Oh, Edgar, Edgar!' she panted, flinging her arms round his neck.  'Oh,\nEdgar darling!  Heathcliff's come back--he is!'  And she tightened her\nembrace to a squeeze.\n\n'Well, well,' cried her husband, crossly, 'don't strangle me for that!  He\nnever struck me as such a marvellous treasure.  There is no need to be\nfrantic!'\n\n'I know you didn't like him,' she answered, repressing a little the\nintensity of her delight.  'Yet, for my sake, you must be friends now.\nShall I tell him to come up?'\n\n'Here,' he said, 'into the parlour?'\n\n'Where else?' she asked.\n\nHe looked vexed, and suggested the kitchen as a more suitable place for\nhim.  Mrs. Linton eyed him with a droll expression--half angry, half\nlaughing at his fastidiousness.\n\n'No,' she added, after a while; 'I cannot sit in the kitchen.  Set two\ntables here, Ellen: one for your master and Miss Isabella, being gentry;\nthe other for Heathcliff and myself, being of the lower orders.  Will\nthat please you, dear?  Or must I have a fire lighted elsewhere?  If so,\ngive directions.  I'll run down and secure my guest.  I'm afraid the joy\nis too great to be real!'\n\nShe was about to dart off again; but Edgar arrested her.\n\n'_You_ bid him step up,' he said, addressing me; 'and, Catherine, try to\nbe glad, without being absurd.  The whole household need not witness the\nsight of your welcoming a runaway servant as a brother.'\n\nI descended, and found Heathcliff waiting under the porch, evidently\nanticipating an invitation to enter.  He followed my guidance without\nwaste of words, and I ushered him into the presence of the master and\nmistress, whose flushed cheeks betrayed signs of warm talking.  But the\nlady's glowed with another feeling when her friend appeared at the door:\nshe sprang forward, took both his hands, and led him to Linton; and then\nshe seized Linton's reluctant fingers and crushed them into his.  Now,\nfully revealed by the fire and candlelight, I was amazed, more than ever,\nto behold the transformation of Heathcliff.  He had grown a tall,\nathletic, well-formed man; beside whom my master seemed quite slender and\nyouth-like.  His upright carriage suggested the idea of his having been\nin the army.  His countenance was much older in expression and decision\nof feature than Mr. Linton's; it looked intelligent, and retained no\nmarks of former degradation.  A half-civilised ferocity lurked yet in the\ndepressed brows and eyes full of black fire, but it was subdued; and his\nmanner was even dignified: quite divested of roughness, though stern for\ngrace.  My master's surprise equalled or exceeded mine: he remained for a\nminute at a loss how to address the ploughboy, as he had called him.\nHeathcliff dropped his slight hand, and stood looking at him coolly till\nhe chose to speak.\n\n'Sit down, sir,' he said, at length.  'Mrs. Linton, recalling old times,\nwould have me give you a cordial reception; and, of course, I am\ngratified when anything occurs to please her.'\n\n'And I also,' answered Heathcliff, 'especially if it be anything in which\nI have a part.  I shall stay an hour or two willingly.'\n\nHe took a seat opposite Catherine, who kept her gaze fixed on him as if\nshe feared he would vanish were she to remove it.  He did not raise his\nto her often: a quick glance now and then sufficed; but it flashed back,\neach time more confidently, the undisguised delight he drank from hers.\nThey were too much absorbed in their mutual joy to suffer embarrassment.\nNot so Mr. Edgar: he grew pale with pure annoyance: a feeling that\nreached its climax when his lady rose, and stepping across the rug,\nseized Heathcliff's hands again, and laughed like one beside herself.\n\n'I shall think it a dream to-morrow!' she cried.  'I shall not be able to\nbelieve that I have seen, and touched, and spoken to you once more.  And\nyet, cruel Heathcliff! you don't deserve this welcome.  To be absent and\nsilent for three years, and never to think of me!'\n\n'A little more than you have thought of me,' he murmured.  'I heard of\nyour marriage, Cathy, not long since; and, while waiting in the yard\nbelow, I meditated this plan--just to have one glimpse of your face, a\nstare of surprise, perhaps, and pretended pleasure; afterwards settle my\nscore with Hindley; and then prevent the law by doing execution on\nmyself.  Your welcome has put these ideas out of my mind; but beware of\nmeeting me with another aspect next time!  Nay, you'll not drive me off\nagain.  You were really sorry for me, were you?  Well, there was cause.\nI've fought through a bitter life since I last heard your voice; and you\nmust forgive me, for I struggled only for you!'\n\n'Catherine, unless we are to have cold tea, please to come to the table,'\ninterrupted Linton, striving to preserve his ordinary tone, and a due\nmeasure of politeness.  'Mr. Heathcliff will have a long walk, wherever\nhe may lodge to-night; and I'm thirsty.'\n\nShe took her post before the urn; and Miss Isabella came, summoned by the\nbell; then, having handed their chairs forward, I left the room.  The\nmeal hardly endured ten minutes.  Catherine's cup was never filled: she\ncould neither eat nor drink.  Edgar had made a slop in his saucer, and\nscarcely swallowed a mouthful.  Their guest did not protract his stay\nthat evening above an hour longer.  I asked, as he departed, if he went\nto Gimmerton?\n\n'No, to Wuthering Heights,' he answered: 'Mr. Earnshaw invited me, when I\ncalled this morning.'\n\nMr. Earnshaw invited _him_! and _he_ called on Mr. Earnshaw!  I pondered\nthis sentence painfully, after he was gone.  Is he turning out a bit of a\nhypocrite, and coming into the country to work mischief under a cloak?  I\nmused: I had a presentiment in the bottom of my heart that he had better\nhave remained away.\n\nAbout the middle of the night, I was wakened from my first nap by Mrs.\nLinton gliding into my chamber, taking a seat on my bedside, and pulling\nme by the hair to rouse me.\n\n'I cannot rest, Ellen,' she said, by way of apology.  'And I want some\nliving creature to keep me company in my happiness!  Edgar is sulky,\nbecause I'm glad of a thing that does not interest him: he refuses to\nopen his mouth, except to utter pettish, silly speeches; and he affirmed\nI was cruel and selfish for wishing to talk when he was so sick and\nsleepy.  He always contrives to be sick at the least cross!  I gave a few\nsentences of commendation to Heathcliff, and he, either for a headache or\na pang of envy, began to cry: so I got up and left him.'\n\n'What use is it praising Heathcliff to him?' I answered.  'As lads they\nhad an aversion to each other, and Heathcliff would hate just as much to\nhear him praised: it's human nature.  Let Mr. Linton alone about him,\nunless you would like an open quarrel between them.'\n\n'But does it not show great weakness?' pursued she.  'I'm not envious: I\nnever feel hurt at the brightness of Isabella's yellow hair and the\nwhiteness of her skin, at her dainty elegance, and the fondness all the\nfamily exhibit for her.  Even you, Nelly, if we have a dispute sometimes,\nyou back Isabella at once; and I yield like a foolish mother: I call her\na darling, and flatter her into a good temper.  It pleases her brother to\nsee us cordial, and that pleases me.  But they are very much alike: they\nare spoiled children, and fancy the world was made for their\naccommodation; and though I humour both, I think a smart chastisement\nmight improve them all the same.'\n\n'You're mistaken, Mrs. Linton,' said I.  'They humour you: I know what\nthere would be to do if they did not.  You can well afford to indulge\ntheir passing whims as long as their business is to anticipate all your\ndesires.  You may, however, fall out, at last, over something of equal\nconsequence to both sides; and then those you term weak are very capable\nof being as obstinate as you.'\n\n'And then we shall fight to the death, sha'n't we, Nelly?' she returned,\nlaughing.  'No! I tell you, I have such faith in Linton's love, that I\nbelieve I might kill him, and he wouldn't wish to retaliate.'\n\nI advised her to value him the more for his affection.\n\n'I do,' she answered, 'but he needn't resort to whining for trifles.  It\nis childish and, instead of melting into tears because I said that\nHeathcliff was now worthy of anyone's regard, and it would honour the\nfirst gentleman in the country to be his friend, he ought to have said it\nfor me, and been delighted from sympathy.  He must get accustomed to him,\nand he may as well like him: considering how Heathcliff has reason to\nobject to him, I'm sure he behaved excellently!'\n\n'What do you think of his going to Wuthering Heights?' I inquired.  'He\nis reformed in every respect, apparently: quite a Christian: offering the\nright hand of fellowship to his enemies all around!'\n\n'He explained it,' she replied.  'I wonder as much as you.  He said he\ncalled to gather information concerning me from you, supposing you\nresided there still; and Joseph told Hindley, who came out and fell to\nquestioning him of what he had been doing, and how he had been living;\nand finally, desired him to walk in.  There were some persons sitting at\ncards; Heathcliff joined them; my brother lost some money to him, and,\nfinding him plentifully supplied, he requested that he would come again\nin the evening: to which he consented.  Hindley is too reckless to select\nhis acquaintance prudently: he doesn't trouble himself to reflect on the\ncauses he might have for mistrusting one whom he has basely injured.  But\nHeathcliff affirms his principal reason for resuming a connection with\nhis ancient persecutor is a wish to install himself in quarters at walking\ndistance from the Grange, and an attachment to the house where we lived\ntogether; and likewise a hope that I shall have more opportunities of\nseeing him there than I could have if he settled in Gimmerton.  He means\nto offer liberal payment for permission to lodge at the Heights; and\ndoubtless my brother's covetousness will prompt him to accept the terms:\nhe was always greedy; though what he grasps with one hand he flings away\nwith the other.'\n\n'It's a nice place for a young man to fix his dwelling in!' said I.  'Have\nyou no fear of the consequences, Mrs. Linton?'\n\n'None for my friend,' she replied: 'his strong head will keep him from\ndanger; a little for Hindley: but he can't be made morally worse than he\nis; and I stand between him and bodily harm.  The event of this evening\nhas reconciled me to God and humanity!  I had risen in angry rebellion\nagainst Providence.  Oh, I've endured very, very bitter misery, Nelly!  If\nthat creature knew how bitter, he'd be ashamed to cloud its removal with\nidle petulance.  It was kindness for him which induced me to bear it\nalone: had I expressed the agony I frequently felt, he would have been\ntaught to long for its alleviation as ardently as I.  However, it's over,\nand I'll take no revenge on his folly; I can afford to suffer anything\nhereafter!  Should the meanest thing alive slap me on the cheek, I'd not\nonly turn the other, but I'd ask pardon for provoking it; and, as a\nproof, I'll go make my peace with Edgar instantly.  Good-night!  I'm an\nangel!'\n\nIn this self-complacent conviction she departed; and the success of her\nfulfilled resolution was obvious on the morrow: Mr. Linton had not only\nabjured his peevishness (though his spirits seemed still subdued by\nCatherine's exuberance of vivacity), but he ventured no objection to her\ntaking Isabella with her to Wuthering Heights in the afternoon; and she\nrewarded him with such a summer of sweetness and affection in return as\nmade the house a paradise for several days; both master and servants\nprofiting from the perpetual sunshine.\n\nHeathcliff--Mr. Heathcliff I should say in future--used the liberty of\nvisiting at Thrushcross Grange cautiously, at first: he seemed estimating\nhow far its owner would bear his intrusion.  Catherine, also, deemed it\njudicious to moderate her expressions of pleasure in receiving him; and\nhe gradually established his right to be expected.  He retained a great\ndeal of the reserve for which his boyhood was remarkable; and that served\nto repress all startling demonstrations of feeling.  My master's\nuneasiness experienced a lull, and further circumstances diverted it into\nanother channel for a space.\n\nHis new source of trouble sprang from the not anticipated misfortune of\nIsabella Linton evincing a sudden and irresistible attraction towards the\ntolerated guest.  She was at that time a charming young lady of eighteen;\ninfantile in manners, though possessed of keen wit, keen feelings, and a\nkeen temper, too, if irritated.  Her brother, who loved her tenderly, was\nappalled at this fantastic preference.  Leaving aside the degradation of\nan alliance with a nameless man, and the possible fact that his property,\nin default of heirs male, might pass into such a one's power, he had\nsense to comprehend Heathcliff's disposition: to know that, though his\nexterior was altered, his mind was unchangeable and unchanged.  And he\ndreaded that mind: it revolted him: he shrank forebodingly from the idea\nof committing Isabella to its keeping.  He would have recoiled still more\nhad he been aware that her attachment rose unsolicited, and was bestowed\nwhere it awakened no reciprocation of sentiment; for the minute he\ndiscovered its existence he laid the blame on Heathcliff's deliberate\ndesigning.\n\nWe had all remarked, during some time, that Miss Linton fretted and pined\nover something.  She grew cross and wearisome; snapping at and teasing\nCatherine continually, at the imminent risk of exhausting her limited\npatience.  We excused her, to a certain extent, on the plea of\nill-health: she was dwindling and fading before our eyes.  But one day,\nwhen she had been peculiarly wayward, rejecting her breakfast,\ncomplaining that the servants did not do what she told them; that the\nmistress would allow her to be nothing in the house, and Edgar neglected\nher; that she had caught a cold with the doors being left open, and we\nlet the parlour fire go out on purpose to vex her, with a hundred yet\nmore frivolous accusations, Mrs. Linton peremptorily insisted that she\nshould get to bed; and, having scolded her heartily, threatened to send\nfor the doctor.  Mention of Kenneth caused her to exclaim, instantly,\nthat her health was perfect, and it was only Catherine's harshness which\nmade her unhappy.\n\n'How can you say I am harsh, you naughty fondling?' cried the mistress,\namazed at the unreasonable assertion.  'You are surely losing your\nreason.  When have I been harsh, tell me?'\n\n'Yesterday,' sobbed Isabella, 'and now!'\n\n'Yesterday!' said her sister-in-law.  'On what occasion?'\n\n'In our walk along the moor: you told me to ramble where I pleased, while\nyou sauntered on with Mr. Heathcliff!'\n\n'And that's your notion of harshness?' said Catherine, laughing.  'It was\nno hint that your company was superfluous?  We didn't care whether you\nkept with us or not; I merely thought Heathcliff's talk would have\nnothing entertaining for your ears.'\n\n'Oh, no,' wept the young lady; 'you wished me away, because you knew I\nliked to be there!'\n\n'Is she sane?' asked Mrs. Linton, appealing to me.  'I'll repeat our\nconversation, word for word, Isabella; and you point out any charm it\ncould have had for you.'\n\n'I don't mind the conversation,' she answered: 'I wanted to be with--'\n\n'Well?' said Catherine, perceiving her hesitate to complete the sentence.\n\n'With him: and I won't be always sent off!' she continued, kindling up.\n'You are a dog in the manger, Cathy, and desire no one to be loved but\nyourself!'\n\n'You are an impertinent little monkey!' exclaimed Mrs. Linton, in\nsurprise.  'But I'll not believe this idiotcy!  It is impossible that you\ncan covet the admiration of Heathcliff--that you consider him an\nagreeable person!  I hope I have misunderstood you, Isabella?'\n\n'No, you have not,' said the infatuated girl.  'I love him more than ever\nyou loved Edgar, and he might love me, if you would let him!'\n\n'I wouldn't be you for a kingdom, then!' Catherine declared,\nemphatically: and she seemed to speak sincerely.  'Nelly, help me to\nconvince her of her madness.  Tell her what Heathcliff is: an unreclaimed\ncreature, without refinement, without cultivation; an arid wilderness of\nfurze and whinstone.  I'd as soon put that little canary into the park on\na winter's day, as recommend you to bestow your heart on him!  It is\ndeplorable ignorance of his character, child, and nothing else, which\nmakes that dream enter your head.  Pray, don't imagine that he conceals\ndepths of benevolence and affection beneath a stern exterior!  He's not a\nrough diamond--a pearl-containing oyster of a rustic: he's a fierce,\npitiless, wolfish man.  I never say to him, \"Let this or that enemy\nalone, because it would be ungenerous or cruel to harm them;\" I say, \"Let\nthem alone, because _I_ should hate them to be wronged:\" and he'd crush\nyou like a sparrow's egg, Isabella, if he found you a troublesome charge.\nI know he couldn't love a Linton; and yet he'd be quite capable of\nmarrying your fortune and expectations: avarice is growing with him a\nbesetting sin.  There's my picture: and I'm his friend--so much so, that\nhad he thought seriously to catch you, I should, perhaps, have held my\ntongue, and let you fall into his trap.'\n\nMiss Linton regarded her sister-in-law with indignation.\n\n'For shame! for shame!' she repeated, angrily.  'You are worse than\ntwenty foes, you poisonous friend!'\n\n'Ah! you won't believe me, then?' said Catherine.  'You think I speak\nfrom wicked selfishness?'\n\n'I'm certain you do,' retorted Isabella; 'and I shudder at you!'\n\n'Good!' cried the other.  'Try for yourself, if that be your spirit: I\nhave done, and yield the argument to your saucy insolence.'--\n\n'And I must suffer for her egotism!' she sobbed, as Mrs. Linton left the\nroom.  'All, all is against me: she has blighted my single consolation.\nBut she uttered falsehoods, didn't she?  Mr. Heathcliff is not a fiend:\nhe has an honourable soul, and a true one, or how could he remember her?'\n\n'Banish him from your thoughts, Miss,' I said.  'He's a bird of bad omen:\nno mate for you.  Mrs. Linton spoke strongly, and yet I can't contradict\nher.  She is better acquainted with his heart than I, or any one besides;\nand she never would represent him as worse than he is.  Honest people\ndon't hide their deeds.  How has he been living? how has he got rich? why\nis he staying at Wuthering Heights, the house of a man whom he abhors?\nThey say Mr. Earnshaw is worse and worse since he came.  They sit up all\nnight together continually, and Hindley has been borrowing money on his\nland, and does nothing but play and drink: I heard only a week ago--it\nwas Joseph who told me--I met him at Gimmerton: \"Nelly,\" he said, \"we's\nhae a crowner's 'quest enow, at ahr folks'.  One on 'em 's a'most getten\nhis finger cut off wi' hauding t' other fro' stickin' hisseln loike a\ncawlf.  That's maister, yeah knaw, 'at 's soa up o' going tuh t' grand\n'sizes.  He's noan feared o' t' bench o' judges, norther Paul, nur Peter,\nnur John, nur Matthew, nor noan on 'em, not he!  He fair likes--he langs\nto set his brazened face agean 'em!  And yon bonny lad Heathcliff, yah\nmind, he's a rare 'un.  He can girn a laugh as well 's onybody at a\nraight divil's jest.  Does he niver say nowt of his fine living amang us,\nwhen he goes to t' Grange?  This is t' way on 't:--up at sun-down: dice,\nbrandy, cloised shutters, und can'le-light till next day at noon: then,\nt'fooil gangs banning und raving to his cham'er, makking dacent fowks dig\nthur fingers i' thur lugs fur varry shame; un' the knave, why he can\ncaint his brass, un' ate, un' sleep, un' off to his neighbour's to gossip\nwi' t' wife.  I' course, he tells Dame Catherine how her fathur's goold\nruns into his pocket, and her fathur's son gallops down t' broad road,\nwhile he flees afore to oppen t' pikes!\"  Now, Miss Linton, Joseph is an\nold rascal, but no liar; and, if his account of Heathcliff's conduct be\ntrue, you would never think of desiring such a husband, would you?'\n\n'You are leagued with the rest, Ellen!' she replied.  'I'll not listen to\nyour slanders.  What malevolence you must have to wish to convince me\nthat there is no happiness in the world!'\n\nWhether she would have got over this fancy if left to herself, or\npersevered in nursing it perpetually, I cannot say: she had little time\nto reflect.  The day after, there was a justice-meeting at the next town;\nmy master was obliged to attend; and Mr. Heathcliff, aware of his\nabsence, called rather earlier than usual.  Catherine and Isabella were\nsitting in the library, on hostile terms, but silent: the latter alarmed\nat her recent indiscretion, and the disclosure she had made of her secret\nfeelings in a transient fit of passion; the former, on mature\nconsideration, really offended with her companion; and, if she laughed\nagain at her pertness, inclined to make it no laughing matter to her.  She\ndid laugh as she saw Heathcliff pass the window.  I was sweeping the\nhearth, and I noticed a mischievous smile on her lips.  Isabella,\nabsorbed in her meditations, or a book, remained till the door opened;\nand it was too late to attempt an escape, which she would gladly have\ndone had it been practicable.\n\n'Come in, that's right!' exclaimed the mistress, gaily, pulling a chair\nto the fire.  'Here are two people sadly in need of a third to thaw the\nice between them; and you are the very one we should both of us choose.\nHeathcliff, I'm proud to show you, at last, somebody that dotes on you\nmore than myself.  I expect you to feel flattered.  Nay, it's not Nelly;\ndon't look at her!  My poor little sister-in-law is breaking her heart by\nmere contemplation of your physical and moral beauty.  It lies in your\nown power to be Edgar's brother!  No, no, Isabella, you sha'n't run off,'\nshe continued, arresting, with feigned playfulness, the confounded girl,\nwho had risen indignantly.  'We were quarrelling like cats about you,\nHeathcliff; and I was fairly beaten in protestations of devotion and\nadmiration: and, moreover, I was informed that if I would but have the\nmanners to stand aside, my rival, as she will have herself to be, would\nshoot a shaft into your soul that would fix you for ever, and send my\nimage into eternal oblivion!'\n\n'Catherine!' said Isabella, calling up her dignity, and disdaining to\nstruggle from the tight grasp that held her, 'I'd thank you to adhere to\nthe truth and not slander me, even in joke!  Mr. Heathcliff, be kind\nenough to bid this friend of yours release me: she forgets that you and I\nare not intimate acquaintances; and what amuses her is painful to me\nbeyond expression.'\n\nAs the guest answered nothing, but took his seat, and looked thoroughly\nindifferent what sentiments she cherished concerning him, she turned and\nwhispered an earnest appeal for liberty to her tormentor.\n\n'By no means!' cried Mrs. Linton in answer.  'I won't be named a dog in\nthe manger again.  You _shall_ stay: now then!  Heathcliff, why don't you\nevince satisfaction at my pleasant news?  Isabella swears that the love\nEdgar has for me is nothing to that she entertains for you.  I'm sure she\nmade some speech of the kind; did she not, Ellen?  And she has fasted\never since the day before yesterday's walk, from sorrow and rage that I\ndespatched her out of your society under the idea of its being\nunacceptable.'\n\n'I think you belie her,' said Heathcliff, twisting his chair to face\nthem.  'She wishes to be out of my society now, at any rate!'\n\nAnd he stared hard at the object of discourse, as one might do at a\nstrange repulsive animal: a centipede from the Indies, for instance,\nwhich curiosity leads one to examine in spite of the aversion it raises.\nThe poor thing couldn't bear that; she grew white and red in rapid\nsuccession, and, while tears beaded her lashes, bent the strength of her\nsmall fingers to loosen the firm clutch of Catherine; and perceiving that\nas fast as she raised one finger off her arm another closed down, and she\ncould not remove the whole together, she began to make use of her nails;\nand their sharpness presently ornamented the detainer's with crescents of\nred.\n\n'There's a tigress!' exclaimed Mrs. Linton, setting her free, and shaking\nher hand with pain.  'Begone, for God's sake, and hide your vixen face!\nHow foolish to reveal those talons to him.  Can't you fancy the\nconclusions he'll draw?  Look, Heathcliff! they are instruments that will\ndo execution--you must beware of your eyes.'\n\n'I'd wrench them off her fingers, if they ever menaced me,' he answered,\nbrutally, when the door had closed after her.  'But what did you mean by\nteasing the creature in that manner, Cathy?  You were not speaking the\ntruth, were you?'\n\n'I assure you I was,' she returned.  'She has been dying for your sake\nseveral weeks, and raving about you this morning, and pouring forth a\ndeluge of abuse, because I represented your failings in a plain light,\nfor the purpose of mitigating her adoration.  But don't notice it\nfurther: I wished to punish her sauciness, that's all.  I like her too\nwell, my dear Heathcliff, to let you absolutely seize and devour her up.'\n\n'And I like her too ill to attempt it,' said he, 'except in a very\nghoulish fashion.  You'd hear of odd things if I lived alone with that\nmawkish, waxen face: the most ordinary would be painting on its white the\ncolours of the rainbow, and turning the blue eyes black, every day or\ntwo: they detestably resemble Linton's.'\n\n'Delectably!' observed Catherine.  'They are dove's eyes--angel's!'\n\n'She's her brother's heir, is she not?' he asked, after a brief silence.\n\n'I should be sorry to think so,' returned his companion.  'Half a dozen\nnephews shall erase her title, please heaven!  Abstract your mind from\nthe subject at present: you are too prone to covet your neighbour's\ngoods; remember _this_ neighbour's goods are mine.'\n\n'If they were _mine_, they would be none the less that,' said Heathcliff;\n'but though Isabella Linton may be silly, she is scarcely mad; and, in\nshort, we'll dismiss the matter, as you advise.'\n\nFrom their tongues they did dismiss it; and Catherine, probably, from her\nthoughts.  The other, I felt certain, recalled it often in the course of\nthe evening.  I saw him smile to himself--grin rather--and lapse into\nominous musing whenever Mrs. Linton had occasion to be absent from the\napartment.\n\nI determined to watch his movements.  My heart invariably cleaved to the\nmaster's, in preference to Catherine's side: with reason I imagined, for\nhe was kind, and trustful, and honourable; and she--she could not be\ncalled _opposite_, yet she seemed to allow herself such wide latitude,\nthat I had little faith in her principles, and still less sympathy for\nher feelings.  I wanted something to happen which might have the effect\nof freeing both Wuthering Heights and the Grange of Mr. Heathcliff\nquietly; leaving us as we had been prior to his advent.  His visits were\na continual nightmare to me; and, I suspected, to my master also.  His\nabode at the Heights was an oppression past explaining.  I felt that God\nhad forsaken the stray sheep there to its own wicked wanderings, and an\nevil beast prowled between it and the fold, waiting his time to spring\nand destroy.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI\n\n\nSometimes, while meditating on these things in solitude, I've got up in a\nsudden terror, and put on my bonnet to go see how all was at the farm.\nI've persuaded my conscience that it was a duty to warn him how people\ntalked regarding his ways; and then I've recollected his confirmed bad\nhabits, and, hopeless of benefiting him, have flinched from re-entering\nthe dismal house, doubting if I could bear to be taken at my word.\n\nOne time I passed the old gate, going out of my way, on a journey to\nGimmerton. It was about the period that my narrative has reached: a\nbright frosty afternoon; the ground bare, and the road hard and dry. I\ncame to a stone where the highway branches off on to the moor at your\nleft hand; a rough sand-pillar, with the letters W. H. cut on its north\nside, on the east, G., and on the south-west, T. G. It serves as a\nguide-post to the Grange, the Heights, and village. The sun shone yellow\non its grey head, reminding me of summer; and I cannot say why, but all\nat once a gush of child's sensations flowed into my heart. Hindley and I\nheld it a favourite spot twenty years before. I gazed long at the\nweather-worn block; and, stooping down, perceived a hole near the bottom\nstill full of snail-shells and pebbles, which we were fond of storing\nthere with more perishable things; and, as fresh as reality, it appeared\nthat I beheld my early playmate seated on the withered turf: his dark,\nsquare head bent forward, and his little hand scooping out the earth\nwith a piece of slate. 'Poor Hindley!' I exclaimed, involuntarily. I\nstarted: my bodily eye was cheated into a momentary belief that the\nchild lifted its face and stared straight into mine! It vanished in a\ntwinkling; but immediately I felt an irresistible yearning to be at the\nHeights. Superstition urged me to comply with this impulse: supposing he\nshould be dead! I thought--or should die soon!--supposing it were a sign\nof death! The nearer I got to the house the more agitated I grew; and on\ncatching sight of it I trembled in every limb. The apparition had\noutstripped me: it stood looking through the gate. That was my first\nidea on observing an elf-locked, brown-eyed boy setting his ruddy\ncountenance against the bars. Further reflection suggested this must be\nHareton, _my_ Hareton, not altered greatly since I left him, ten months\nsince.\n\n'God bless thee, darling!' I cried, forgetting instantaneously my\nfoolish fears. 'Hareton, it's Nelly! Nelly, thy nurse.'\n\nHe retreated out of arm's length, and picked up a large flint.\n\n'I am come to see thy father, Hareton,' I added, guessing from the\naction that Nelly, if she lived in his memory at all, was not recognised\nas one with me.\n\nHe raised his missile to hurl it; I commenced a soothing speech, but\ncould not stay his hand: the stone struck my bonnet; and then ensued,\nfrom the stammering lips of the little fellow, a string of curses, which,\nwhether he comprehended them or not, were delivered with practised\nemphasis, and distorted his baby features into a shocking expression of\nmalignity.  You may be certain this grieved more than angered me.  Fit to\ncry, I took an orange from my pocket, and offered it to propitiate him.\nHe hesitated, and then snatched it from my hold; as if he fancied I only\nintended to tempt and disappoint him.  I showed another, keeping it out\nof his reach.\n\n'Who has taught you those fine words, my bairn?' I inquired.  'The\ncurate?'\n\n'Damn the curate, and thee!  Gie me that,' he replied.\n\n'Tell us where you got your lessons, and you shall have it,' said I.\n'Who's your master?'\n\n'Devil daddy,' was his answer.\n\n'And what do you learn from daddy?' I continued.\n\nHe jumped at the fruit; I raised it higher.  'What does he teach you?' I\nasked.\n\n'Naught,' said he, 'but to keep out of his gait.  Daddy cannot bide me,\nbecause I swear at him.'\n\n'Ah! and the devil teaches you to swear at daddy?' I observed.\n\n'Ay--nay,' he drawled.\n\n'Who, then?'\n\n'Heathcliff.'\n\n'I asked if he liked Mr. Heathcliff.'\n\n'Ay!' he answered again.\n\nDesiring to have his reasons for liking him, I could only gather the\nsentences--'I known't: he pays dad back what he gies to me--he curses\ndaddy for cursing me.  He says I mun do as I will.'\n\n'And the curate does not teach you to read and write, then?' I pursued.\n\n'No, I was told the curate should have his--teeth dashed down his--throat,\nif he stepped over the threshold--Heathcliff had promised that!'\n\nI put the orange in his hand, and bade him tell his father that a woman\ncalled Nelly Dean was waiting to speak with him, by the garden gate.  He\nwent up the walk, and entered the house; but, instead of Hindley,\nHeathcliff appeared on the door-stones; and I turned directly and ran\ndown the road as hard as ever I could race, making no halt till I gained\nthe guide-post, and feeling as scared as if I had raised a goblin.  This\nis not much connected with Miss Isabella's affair: except that it urged\nme to resolve further on mounting vigilant guard, and doing my utmost to\ncheck the spread of such bad influence at the Grange: even though I\nshould wake a domestic storm, by thwarting Mrs. Linton's pleasure.\n\nThe next time Heathcliff came my young lady chanced to be feeding some\npigeons in the court.  She had never spoken a word to her sister-in-law\nfor three days; but she had likewise dropped her fretful complaining, and\nwe found it a great comfort.  Heathcliff had not the habit of bestowing a\nsingle unnecessary civility on Miss Linton, I knew.  Now, as soon as he\nbeheld her, his first precaution was to take a sweeping survey of the\nhouse-front.  I was standing by the kitchen-window, but I drew out of\nsight.  He then stepped across the pavement to her, and said something:\nshe seemed embarrassed, and desirous of getting away; to prevent it, he\nlaid his hand on her arm.  She averted her face: he apparently put some\nquestion which she had no mind to answer.  There was another rapid glance\nat the house, and supposing himself unseen, the scoundrel had the\nimpudence to embrace her.\n\n'Judas!  Traitor!' I ejaculated.  'You are a hypocrite, too, are you?  A\ndeliberate deceiver.'\n\n'Who is, Nelly?' said Catherine's voice at my elbow: I had been\nover-intent on watching the pair outside to mark her entrance.\n\n'Your worthless friend!' I answered, warmly: 'the sneaking rascal yonder.\nAh, he has caught a glimpse of us--he is coming in!  I wonder will he\nhave the heart to find a plausible excuse for making love to Miss, when\nhe told you he hated her?'\n\nMrs. Linton saw Isabella tear herself free, and run into the garden; and\na minute after, Heathcliff opened the door.  I couldn't withhold giving\nsome loose to my indignation; but Catherine angrily insisted on silence,\nand threatened to order me out of the kitchen, if I dared to be so\npresumptuous as to put in my insolent tongue.\n\n'To hear you, people might think you were the mistress!' she cried.  'You\nwant setting down in your right place!  Heathcliff, what are you about,\nraising this stir?  I said you must let Isabella alone!--I beg you will,\nunless you are tired of being received here, and wish Linton to draw the\nbolts against you!'\n\n'God forbid that he should try!' answered the black villain.  I detested\nhim just then.  'God keep him meek and patient!  Every day I grow madder\nafter sending him to heaven!'\n\n'Hush!' said Catherine, shutting the inner door!  'Don't vex me.  Why\nhave you disregarded my request?  Did she come across you on purpose?'\n\n'What is it to you?' he growled.  'I have a right to kiss her, if she\nchooses; and you have no right to object.  I am not _your_ husband: _you_\nneedn't be jealous of me!'\n\n'I'm not jealous of you,' replied the mistress; 'I'm jealous for you.\nClear your face: you sha'n't scowl at me!  If you like Isabella, you\nshall marry her.  But do you like her?  Tell the truth, Heathcliff!\nThere, you won't answer.  I'm certain you don't.'\n\n'And would Mr. Linton approve of his sister marrying that man?' I\ninquired.\n\n'Mr. Linton should approve,' returned my lady, decisively.\n\n'He might spare himself the trouble,' said Heathcliff: 'I could do as\nwell without his approbation. And as to you, Catherine, I have a mind to\nspeak a few words now, while we are at it. I want you to be aware that I\n_know_ you have treated me infernally--infernally! Do you hear? And if\nyou flatter yourself that I don't perceive it, you are a fool; and if\nyou think I can be consoled by sweet words, you are an idiot: and if you\nfancy I'll suffer unrevenged, I'll convince you of the contrary, in a\nvery little while! Meantime, thank you for telling me your\nsister-in-law's secret: I swear I'll make the most of it. And stand you\naside!'\n\n'What new phase of his character is this?' exclaimed Mrs. Linton, in\namazement.  'I've treated you infernally--and you'll take your revenge!\nHow will you take it, ungrateful brute?  How have I treated you\ninfernally?'\n\n'I seek no revenge on you,' replied Heathcliff, less vehemently.  'That's\nnot the plan.  The tyrant grinds down his slaves and they don't turn\nagainst him; they crush those beneath them.  You are welcome to torture\nme to death for your amusement, only allow me to amuse myself a little in\nthe same style, and refrain from insult as much as you are able.  Having\nlevelled my palace, don't erect a hovel and complacently admire your own\ncharity in giving me that for a home.  If I imagined you really wished me\nto marry Isabel, I'd cut my throat!'\n\n'Oh, the evil is that I am _not_ jealous, is it?' cried Catherine.  'Well,\nI won't repeat my offer of a wife: it is as bad as offering Satan a lost\nsoul.  Your bliss lies, like his, in inflicting misery.  You prove it.\nEdgar is restored from the ill-temper he gave way to at your coming; I\nbegin to be secure and tranquil; and you, restless to know us at peace,\nappear resolved on exciting a quarrel.  Quarrel with Edgar, if you\nplease, Heathcliff, and deceive his sister: you'll hit on exactly the\nmost efficient method of revenging yourself on me.'\n\nThe conversation ceased.  Mrs. Linton sat down by the fire, flushed and\ngloomy.  The spirit which served her was growing intractable: she could\nneither lay nor control it.  He stood on the hearth with folded arms,\nbrooding on his evil thoughts; and in this position I left them to seek\nthe master, who was wondering what kept Catherine below so long.\n\n'Ellen,' said he, when I entered, 'have you seen your mistress?'\n\n'Yes; she's in the kitchen, sir,' I answered.  'She's sadly put out by\nMr. Heathcliff's behaviour: and, indeed, I do think it's time to arrange\nhis visits on another footing.  There's harm in being too soft, and now\nit's come to this--.'  And I related the scene in the court, and, as near\nas I dared, the whole subsequent dispute.  I fancied it could not be very\nprejudicial to Mrs. Linton; unless she made it so afterwards, by assuming\nthe defensive for her guest.  Edgar Linton had difficulty in hearing me\nto the close.  His first words revealed that he did not clear his wife of\nblame.\n\n'This is insufferable!' he exclaimed.  'It is disgraceful that she should\nown him for a friend, and force his company on me!  Call me two men out\nof the hall, Ellen.  Catherine shall linger no longer to argue with the\nlow ruffian--I have humoured her enough.'\n\nHe descended, and bidding the servants wait in the passage, went,\nfollowed by me, to the kitchen.  Its occupants had recommenced their\nangry discussion: Mrs. Linton, at least, was scolding with renewed\nvigour; Heathcliff had moved to the window, and hung his head, somewhat\ncowed by her violent rating apparently.  He saw the master first, and\nmade a hasty motion that she should be silent; which she obeyed,\nabruptly, on discovering the reason of his intimation.\n\n'How is this?' said Linton, addressing her; 'what notion of propriety\nmust you have to remain here, after the language which has been held to\nyou by that blackguard?  I suppose, because it is his ordinary talk you\nthink nothing of it: you are habituated to his baseness, and, perhaps,\nimagine I can get used to it too!'\n\n'Have you been listening at the door, Edgar?' asked the mistress, in a\ntone particularly calculated to provoke her husband, implying both\ncarelessness and contempt of his irritation.  Heathcliff, who had raised\nhis eyes at the former speech, gave a sneering laugh at the latter; on\npurpose, it seemed, to draw Mr. Linton's attention to him.  He succeeded;\nbut Edgar did not mean to entertain him with any high flights of passion.\n\n'I've been so far forbearing with you, sir,' he said quietly; 'not that I\nwas ignorant of your miserable, degraded character, but I felt you were\nonly partly responsible for that; and Catherine wishing to keep up your\nacquaintance, I acquiesced--foolishly.  Your presence is a moral poison\nthat would contaminate the most virtuous: for that cause, and to prevent\nworse consequences, I shall deny you hereafter admission into this house,\nand give notice now that I require your instant departure.  Three\nminutes' delay will render it involuntary and ignominious.\n\nHeathcliff measured the height and breadth of the speaker with an eye\nfull of derision.\n\n'Cathy, this lamb of yours threatens like a bull!' he said.  'It is in\ndanger of splitting its skull against my knuckles.  By God!  Mr. Linton,\nI'm mortally sorry that you are not worth knocking down!'\n\nMy master glanced towards the passage, and signed me to fetch the men: he\nhad no intention of hazarding a personal encounter.  I obeyed the hint;\nbut Mrs. Linton, suspecting something, followed; and when I attempted to\ncall them, she pulled me back, slammed the door to, and locked it.\n\n'Fair means!' she said, in answer to her husband's look of angry\nsurprise.  'If you have not courage to attack him, make an apology, or\nallow yourself to be beaten.  It will correct you of feigning more valour\nthan you possess.  No, I'll swallow the key before you shall get it!  I'm\ndelightfully rewarded for my kindness to each!  After constant indulgence\nof one's weak nature, and the other's bad one, I earn for thanks two\nsamples of blind ingratitude, stupid to absurdity!  Edgar, I was\ndefending you and yours; and I wish Heathcliff may flog you sick, for\ndaring to think an evil thought of me!'\n\nIt did not need the medium of a flogging to produce that effect on the\nmaster.  He tried to wrest the key from Catherine's grasp, and for safety\nshe flung it into the hottest part of the fire; whereupon Mr. Edgar was\ntaken with a nervous trembling, and his countenance grew deadly pale.  For\nhis life he could not avert that excess of emotion: mingled anguish and\nhumiliation overcame him completely.  He leant on the back of a chair,\nand covered his face.\n\n'Oh, heavens!  In old days this would win you knighthood!' exclaimed Mrs.\nLinton.  'We are vanquished! we are vanquished!  Heathcliff would as soon\nlift a finger at you as the king would march his army against a colony of\nmice.  Cheer up! you sha'n't be hurt!  Your type is not a lamb, it's a\nsucking leveret.'\n\n'I wish you joy of the milk-blooded coward, Cathy!' said her friend.  'I\ncompliment you on your taste.  And that is the slavering, shivering thing\nyou preferred to me!  I would not strike him with my fist, but I'd kick\nhim with my foot, and experience considerable satisfaction.  Is he\nweeping, or is he going to faint for fear?'\n\nThe fellow approached and gave the chair on which Linton rested a push.\nHe'd better have kept his distance: my master quickly sprang erect, and\nstruck him full on the throat a blow that would have levelled a slighter\nman.  It took his breath for a minute; and while he choked, Mr. Linton\nwalked out by the back door into the yard, and from thence to the front\nentrance.\n\n'There! you've done with coming here,' cried Catherine.  'Get away, now;\nhe'll return with a brace of pistols and half-a-dozen assistants.  If he\ndid overhear us, of course he'd never forgive you.  You've played me an\nill turn, Heathcliff!  But go--make haste!  I'd rather see Edgar at bay\nthan you.'\n\n'Do you suppose I'm going with that blow burning in my gullet?' he\nthundered.  'By hell, no!  I'll crush his ribs in like a rotten hazel-nut\nbefore I cross the threshold!  If I don't floor him now, I shall murder\nhim some time; so, as you value his existence, let me get at him!'\n\n'He is not coming,' I interposed, framing a bit of a lie.  'There's the\ncoachman and the two gardeners; you'll surely not wait to be thrust into\nthe road by them!  Each has a bludgeon; and master will, very likely, be\nwatching from the parlour-windows to see that they fulfil his orders.'\n\nThe gardeners and coachman were there: but Linton was with them.  They\nhad already entered the court.  Heathcliff, on the second thoughts,\nresolved to avoid a struggle against three underlings: he seized the\npoker, smashed the lock from the inner door, and made his escape as they\ntramped in.\n\nMrs. Linton, who was very much excited, bade me accompany her up-stairs.\nShe did not know my share in contributing to the disturbance, and I was\nanxious to keep her in ignorance.\n\n'I'm nearly distracted, Nelly!' she exclaimed, throwing herself on the\nsofa.  'A thousand smiths' hammers are beating in my head!  Tell Isabella\nto shun me; this uproar is owing to her; and should she or any one else\naggravate my anger at present, I shall get wild.  And, Nelly, say to\nEdgar, if you see him again to-night, that I'm in danger of being\nseriously ill.  I wish it may prove true.  He has startled and distressed\nme shockingly!  I want to frighten him.  Besides, he might come and begin\na string of abuse or complainings; I'm certain I should recriminate, and\nGod knows where we should end!  Will you do so, my good Nelly?  You are\naware that I am no way blamable in this matter.  What possessed him to\nturn listener?  Heathcliff's talk was outrageous, after you left us; but\nI could soon have diverted him from Isabella, and the rest meant nothing.\nNow all is dashed wrong; by the fool's craving to hear evil of self, that\nhaunts some people like a demon!  Had Edgar never gathered our\nconversation, he would never have been the worse for it.  Really, when he\nopened on me in that unreasonable tone of displeasure after I had scolded\nHeathcliff till I was hoarse for him, I did not care hardly what they did\nto each other; especially as I felt that, however the scene closed, we\nshould all be driven asunder for nobody knows how long!  Well, if I\ncannot keep Heathcliff for my friend--if Edgar will be mean and jealous,\nI'll try to break their hearts by breaking my own.  That will be a prompt\nway of finishing all, when I am pushed to extremity!  But it's a deed to\nbe reserved for a forlorn hope; I'd not take Linton by surprise with it.\nTo this point he has been discreet in dreading to provoke me; you must\nrepresent the peril of quitting that policy, and remind him of my\npassionate temper, verging, when kindled, on frenzy.  I wish you could\ndismiss that apathy out of that countenance, and look rather more anxious\nabout me.'\n\nThe stolidity with which I received these instructions was, no doubt,\nrather exasperating: for they were delivered in perfect sincerity; but I\nbelieved a person who could plan the turning of her fits of passion to\naccount, beforehand, might, by exerting her will, manage to control\nherself tolerably, even while under their influence; and I did not wish\nto 'frighten' her husband, as she said, and multiply his annoyances for\nthe purpose of serving her selfishness.  Therefore I said nothing when I\nmet the master coming towards the parlour; but I took the liberty of\nturning back to listen whether they would resume their quarrel together.\nHe began to speak first.\n\n'Remain where you are, Catherine,' he said; without any anger in his\nvoice, but with much sorrowful despondency.  'I shall not stay.  I am\nneither come to wrangle nor be reconciled; but I wish just to learn\nwhether, after this evening's events, you intend to continue your\nintimacy with--'\n\n'Oh, for mercy's sake,' interrupted the mistress, stamping her foot, 'for\nmercy's sake, let us hear no more of it now!  Your cold blood cannot be\nworked into a fever: your veins are full of ice-water; but mine are\nboiling, and the sight of such chillness makes them dance.'\n\n'To get rid of me, answer my question,' persevered Mr. Linton.  'You must\nanswer it; and that violence does not alarm me.  I have found that you\ncan be as stoical as anyone, when you please.  Will you give up\nHeathcliff hereafter, or will you give up me?  It is impossible for you\nto be _my_ friend and _his_ at the same time; and I absolutely _require_\nto know which you choose.'\n\n'I require to be let alone!' exclaimed Catherine, furiously.  'I demand\nit!  Don't you see I can scarcely stand?  Edgar, you--you leave me!'\n\nShe rang the bell till it broke with a twang; I entered leisurely.  It\nwas enough to try the temper of a saint, such senseless, wicked rages!\nThere she lay dashing her head against the arm of the sofa, and grinding\nher teeth, so that you might fancy she would crash them to splinters!  Mr.\nLinton stood looking at her in sudden compunction and fear.  He told me\nto fetch some water.  She had no breath for speaking.  I brought a glass\nfull; and as she would not drink, I sprinkled it on her face.  In a few\nseconds she stretched herself out stiff, and turned up her eyes, while\nher cheeks, at once blanched and livid, assumed the aspect of death.\nLinton looked terrified.\n\n'There is nothing in the world the matter,' I whispered.  I did not want\nhim to yield, though I could not help being afraid in my heart.\n\n'She has blood on her lips!' he said, shuddering.\n\n'Never mind!' I answered, tartly. And I told him how she had resolved,\nprevious to his coming, on exhibiting a fit of frenzy. I incautiously\ngave the account aloud, and she heard me; for she started up--her hair\nflying over her shoulders, her eyes flashing, the muscles of her neck\nand arms standing out preternaturally. I made up my mind for broken\nbones, at least; but she only glared about her for an instant, and then\nrushed from the room. The master directed me to follow; I did, to her\nchamber-door: she hindered me from going further by securing it against\nme.\n\nAs she never offered to descend to breakfast next morning, I went to ask\nwhether she would have some carried up.  'No!' she replied, peremptorily.\nThe same question was repeated at dinner and tea; and again on the morrow\nafter, and received the same answer.  Mr. Linton, on his part, spent his\ntime in the library, and did not inquire concerning his wife's\noccupations.  Isabella and he had had an hour's interview, during which\nhe tried to elicit from her some sentiment of proper horror for\nHeathcliff's advances: but he could make nothing of her evasive replies,\nand was obliged to close the examination unsatisfactorily; adding,\nhowever, a solemn warning, that if she were so insane as to encourage\nthat worthless suitor, it would dissolve all bonds of relationship\nbetween herself and him.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII\n\n\nWhile Miss Linton moped about the park and garden, always silent, and\nalmost always in tears; and her brother shut himself up among books that\nhe never opened--wearying, I guessed, with a continual vague expectation\nthat Catherine, repenting her conduct, would come of her own accord to\nask pardon, and seek a reconciliation--and _she_ fasted pertinaciously,\nunder the idea, probably, that at every meal Edgar was ready to choke for\nher absence, and pride alone held him from running to cast himself at her\nfeet; I went about my household duties, convinced that the Grange had but\none sensible soul in its walls, and that lodged in my body.  I wasted no\ncondolences on Miss, nor any expostulations on my mistress; nor did I pay\nmuch attention to the sighs of my master, who yearned to hear his lady's\nname, since he might not hear her voice.  I determined they should come\nabout as they pleased for me; and though it was a tiresomely slow\nprocess, I began to rejoice at length in a faint dawn of its progress: as\nI thought at first.\n\nMrs. Linton, on the third day, unbarred her door, and having finished the\nwater in her pitcher and decanter, desired a renewed supply, and a basin\nof gruel, for she believed she was dying.  That I set down as a speech\nmeant for Edgar's ears; I believed no such thing, so I kept it to myself\nand brought her some tea and dry toast.  She ate and drank eagerly, and\nsank back on her pillow again, clenching her hands and groaning.  'Oh, I\nwill die,' she exclaimed, 'since no one cares anything about me.  I wish\nI had not taken that.'  Then a good while after I heard her murmur, 'No,\nI'll not die--he'd be glad--he does not love me at all--he would never\nmiss me!'\n\n'Did you want anything, ma'am?' I inquired, still preserving my external\ncomposure, in spite of her ghastly countenance and strange, exaggerated\nmanner.\n\n'What is that apathetic being doing?' she demanded, pushing the thick\nentangled locks from her wasted face.  'Has he fallen into a lethargy, or\nis he dead?'\n\n'Neither,' replied I; 'if you mean Mr. Linton.  He's tolerably well, I\nthink, though his studies occupy him rather more than they ought: he is\ncontinually among his books, since he has no other society.'\n\nI should not have spoken so if I had known her true condition, but I\ncould not get rid of the notion that she acted a part of her disorder.\n\n'Among his books!' she cried, confounded.  'And I dying!  I on the brink\nof the grave!  My God! does he know how I'm altered?' continued she,\nstaring at her reflection in a mirror hanging against the opposite wall.\n'Is that Catherine Linton?  He imagines me in a pet--in play, perhaps.\nCannot you inform him that it is frightful earnest?  Nelly, if it be not\ntoo late, as soon as I learn how he feels, I'll choose between these two:\neither to starve at once--that would be no punishment unless he had a\nheart--or to recover, and leave the country.  Are you speaking the truth\nabout him now?  Take care.  Is he actually so utterly indifferent for my\nlife?'\n\n'Why, ma'am,' I answered, 'the master has no idea of your being deranged;\nand of course he does not fear that you will let yourself die of hunger.'\n\n'You think not?  Cannot you tell him I will?' she returned.  'Persuade\nhim! speak of your own mind: say you are certain I will!'\n\n'No, you forget, Mrs. Linton,' I suggested, 'that you have eaten some\nfood with a relish this evening, and to-morrow you will perceive its good\neffects.'\n\n'If I were only sure it would kill him,' she interrupted, 'I'd kill\nmyself directly!  These three awful nights I've never closed my lids--and\noh, I've been tormented!  I've been haunted, Nelly!  But I begin to fancy\nyou don't like me.  How strange!  I thought, though everybody hated and\ndespised each other, they could not avoid loving me.  And they have all\nturned to enemies in a few hours: they have, I'm positive; the people\nhere.  How dreary to meet death, surrounded by their cold faces!\nIsabella, terrified and repelled, afraid to enter the room, it would be\nso dreadful to watch Catherine go.  And Edgar standing solemnly by to see\nit over; then offering prayers of thanks to God for restoring peace to\nhis house, and going back to his _books_!  What in the name of all that\nfeels has he to do with _books_, when I am dying?'\n\nShe could not bear the notion which I had put into her head of Mr.\nLinton's philosophical resignation.  Tossing about, she increased her\nfeverish bewilderment to madness, and tore the pillow with her teeth;\nthen raising herself up all burning, desired that I would open the\nwindow.  We were in the middle of winter, the wind blew strong from the\nnorth-east, and I objected.  Both the expressions flitting over her face,\nand the changes of her moods, began to alarm me terribly; and brought to\nmy recollection her former illness, and the doctor's injunction that she\nshould not be crossed.  A minute previously she was violent; now,\nsupported on one arm, and not noticing my refusal to obey her, she seemed\nto find childish diversion in pulling the feathers from the rents she had\njust made, and ranging them on the sheet according to their different\nspecies: her mind had strayed to other associations.\n\n'That's a turkey's,' she murmured to herself; 'and this is a wild duck's;\nand this is a pigeon's.  Ah, they put pigeons' feathers in the pillows--no\nwonder I couldn't die!  Let me take care to throw it on the floor when I\nlie down.  And here is a moor-cock's; and this--I should know it among a\nthousand--it's a lapwing's.  Bonny bird; wheeling over our heads in the\nmiddle of the moor.  It wanted to get to its nest, for the clouds had\ntouched the swells, and it felt rain coming.  This feather was picked up\nfrom the heath, the bird was not shot: we saw its nest in the winter,\nfull of little skeletons.  Heathcliff set a trap over it, and the old\nones dared not come.  I made him promise he'd never shoot a lapwing after\nthat, and he didn't.  Yes, here are more!  Did he shoot my lapwings,\nNelly?  Are they red, any of them?  Let me look.'\n\n'Give over with that baby-work!' I interrupted, dragging the pillow away,\nand turning the holes towards the mattress, for she was removing its\ncontents by handfuls.  'Lie down and shut your eyes: you're wandering.\nThere's a mess!  The down is flying about like snow.'\n\nI went here and there collecting it.\n\n'I see in you, Nelly,' she continued dreamily, 'an aged woman: you have\ngrey hair and bent shoulders.  This bed is the fairy cave under Penistone\ncrags, and you are gathering elf-bolts to hurt our heifers; pretending,\nwhile I am near, that they are only locks of wool.  That's what you'll\ncome to fifty years hence: I know you are not so now.  I'm not wandering:\nyou're mistaken, or else I should believe you really _were_ that withered\nhag, and I should think I _was_ under Penistone Crags; and I'm conscious\nit's night, and there are two candles on the table making the black press\nshine like jet.'\n\n'The black press? where is that?' I asked.  'You are talking in your\nsleep!'\n\n'It's against the wall, as it always is,' she replied.  'It _does_ appear\nodd--I see a face in it!'\n\n'There's no press in the room, and never was,' said I, resuming my seat,\nand looping up the curtain that I might watch her.\n\n'Don't _you_ see that face?' she inquired, gazing earnestly at the\nmirror.\n\nAnd say what I could, I was incapable of making her comprehend it to be\nher own; so I rose and covered it with a shawl.\n\n'It's behind there still!' she pursued, anxiously.  'And it stirred.  Who\nis it?  I hope it will not come out when you are gone!  Oh!  Nelly, the\nroom is haunted!  I'm afraid of being alone!'\n\nI took her hand in mine, and bid her be composed; for a succession of\nshudders convulsed her frame, and she would keep straining her gaze\ntowards the glass.\n\n'There's nobody here!' I insisted.  'It was _yourself_, Mrs. Linton: you\nknew it a while since.'\n\n'Myself!' she gasped, 'and the clock is striking twelve!  It's true,\nthen! that's dreadful!'\n\nHer fingers clutched the clothes, and gathered them over her eyes.  I\nattempted to steal to the door with an intention of calling her husband;\nbut I was summoned back by a piercing shriek--the shawl had dropped from\nthe frame.\n\n'Why, what is the matter?' cried I.  'Who is coward now?  Wake up!  That\nis the glass--the mirror, Mrs. Linton; and you see yourself in it, and\nthere am I too by your side.'\n\nTrembling and bewildered, she held me fast, but the horror gradually\npassed from her countenance; its paleness gave place to a glow of shame.\n\n'Oh, dear!  I thought I was at home,' she sighed.  'I thought I was lying\nin my chamber at Wuthering Heights.  Because I'm weak, my brain got\nconfused, and I screamed unconsciously.  Don't say anything; but stay\nwith me.  I dread sleeping: my dreams appal me.'\n\n'A sound sleep would do you good, ma'am,' I answered: 'and I hope this\nsuffering will prevent your trying starving again.'\n\n'Oh, if I were but in my own bed in the old house!' she went on bitterly,\nwringing her hands.  'And that wind sounding in the firs by the lattice.\nDo let me feel it--it comes straight down the moor--do let me have one\nbreath!'  To pacify her I held the casement ajar a few seconds.  A cold\nblast rushed through; I closed it, and returned to my post.  She lay\nstill now, her face bathed in tears.  Exhaustion of body had entirely\nsubdued her spirit: our fiery Catherine was no better than a wailing\nchild.\n\n'How long is it since I shut myself in here?' she asked, suddenly\nreviving.\n\n'It was Monday evening,' I replied, 'and this is Thursday night, or\nrather Friday morning, at present.'\n\n'What! of the same week?' she exclaimed.  'Only that brief time?'\n\n'Long enough to live on nothing but cold water and ill-temper,' observed\nI.\n\n'Well, it seems a weary number of hours,' she muttered doubtfully: 'it\nmust be more. I remember being in the parlour after they had quarrelled,\nand Edgar being cruelly provoking, and me running into this room\ndesperate. As soon as ever I had barred the door, utter blackness\noverwhelmed me, and I fell on the floor. I couldn't explain to Edgar how\ncertain I felt of having a fit, or going raging mad, if he persisted in\nteasing me! I had no command of tongue, or brain, and he did not guess\nmy agony, perhaps: it barely left me sense to try to escape from him and\nhis voice. Before I recovered sufficiently to see and hear, it began to\nbe dawn, and, Nelly, I'll tell you what I thought, and what has kept\nrecurring and recurring till I feared for my reason. I thought as I lay\nthere, with my head against that table leg, and my eyes dimly discerning\nthe grey square of the window, that I was enclosed in the oak-panelled\nbed at home; and my heart ached with some great grief which, just\nwaking, I could not recollect. I pondered, and worried myself to\ndiscover what it could be, and, most strangely, the whole last seven\nyears of my life grew a blank! I did not recall that they had been at\nall. I was a child; my father was just buried, and my misery arose from\nthe separation that Hindley had ordered between me and Heathcliff. I was\nlaid alone, for the first time; and, rousing from a dismal doze after a\nnight of weeping, I lifted my hand to push the panels aside: it struck\nthe table-top! I swept it along the carpet, and then memory burst in: my\nlate anguish was swallowed in a paroxysm of despair. I cannot say why I\nfelt so wildly wretched: it must have been temporary derangement; for\nthere is scarcely cause. But, supposing at twelve years old I had been\nwrenched from the Heights, and every early association, and my all in\nall, as Heathcliff was at that time, and been converted at a stroke into\nMrs. Linton, the lady of Thrushcross Grange, and the wife of a stranger:\nan exile, and outcast, thenceforth, from what had been my world. You may\nfancy a glimpse of the abyss where I grovelled! Shake your head as you\nwill, Nelly, you have helped to unsettle me! You should have spoken to\nEdgar, indeed you should, and compelled him to leave me quiet! Oh, I'm\nburning! I wish I were out of doors! I wish I were a girl again, half\nsavage and hardy, and free; and laughing at injuries, not maddening\nunder them! Why am I so changed? why does my blood rush into a hell of\ntumult at a few words? I'm sure I should be myself were I once among the\nheather on those hills. Open the window again wide: fasten it open!\nQuick, why don't you move?'\n\n'Because I won't give you your death of cold,' I answered.\n\n'You won't give me a chance of life, you mean,' she said, sullenly.\n'However, I'm not helpless yet; I'll open it myself.'\n\nAnd sliding from the bed before I could hinder her, she crossed the room,\nwalking very uncertainly, threw it back, and bent out, careless of the\nfrosty air that cut about her shoulders as keen as a knife.  I entreated,\nand finally attempted to force her to retire.  But I soon found her\ndelirious strength much surpassed mine (she was delirious, I became\nconvinced by her subsequent actions and ravings).  There was no moon, and\neverything beneath lay in misty darkness: not a light gleamed from any\nhouse, far or near all had been extinguished long ago: and those at\nWuthering Heights were never visible--still she asserted she caught their\nshining.\n\n'Look!' she cried eagerly, 'that's my room with the candle in it, and the\ntrees swaying before it; and the other candle is in Joseph's garret.\nJoseph sits up late, doesn't he?  He's waiting till I come home that he\nmay lock the gate.  Well, he'll wait a while yet.  It's a rough journey,\nand a sad heart to travel it; and we must pass by Gimmerton Kirk to go\nthat journey!  We've braved its ghosts often together, and dared each\nother to stand among the graves and ask them to come.  But, Heathcliff,\nif I dare you now, will you venture?  If you do, I'll keep you.  I'll not\nlie there by myself: they may bury me twelve feet deep, and throw the\nchurch down over me, but I won't rest till you are with me.  I never\nwill!'\n\nShe paused, and resumed with a strange smile.  'He's considering--he'd\nrather I'd come to him!  Find a way, then! not through that kirkyard.  You\nare slow!  Be content, you always followed me!'\n\nPerceiving it vain to argue against her insanity, I was planning how I\ncould reach something to wrap about her, without quitting my hold of\nherself (for I could not trust her alone by the gaping lattice), when, to\nmy consternation, I heard the rattle of the door-handle, and Mr. Linton\nentered.  He had only then come from the library; and, in passing through\nthe lobby, had noticed our talking and been attracted by curiosity, or\nfear, to examine what it signified, at that late hour.\n\n'Oh, sir!' I cried, checking the exclamation risen to his lips at the\nsight which met him, and the bleak atmosphere of the chamber.  'My poor\nmistress is ill, and she quite masters me: I cannot manage her at all;\npray, come and persuade her to go to bed.  Forget your anger, for she's\nhard to guide any way but her own.'\n\n'Catherine ill?' he said, hastening to us.  'Shut the window, Ellen!\nCatherine! why--'\n\nHe was silent.  The haggardness of Mrs. Linton's appearance smote him\nspeechless, and he could only glance from her to me in horrified\nastonishment.\n\n'She's been fretting here,' I continued, 'and eating scarcely anything,\nand never complaining: she would admit none of us till this evening, and\nso we couldn't inform you of her state, as we were not aware of it\nourselves; but it is nothing.'\n\nI felt I uttered my explanations awkwardly; the master frowned.  'It is\nnothing, is it, Ellen Dean?' he said sternly.  'You shall account more\nclearly for keeping me ignorant of this!'  And he took his wife in his\narms, and looked at her with anguish.\n\nAt first she gave him no glance of recognition: he was invisible to her\nabstracted gaze.  The delirium was not fixed, however; having weaned her\neyes from contemplating the outer darkness, by degrees she centred her\nattention on him, and discovered who it was that held her.\n\n'Ah! you are come, are you, Edgar Linton?' she said, with angry\nanimation.  'You are one of those things that are ever found when least\nwanted, and when you are wanted, never!  I suppose we shall have plenty\nof lamentations now--I see we shall--but they can't keep me from my\nnarrow home out yonder: my resting-place, where I'm bound before spring\nis over!  There it is: not among the Lintons, mind, under the\nchapel-roof, but in the open air, with a head-stone; and you may please\nyourself whether you go to them or come to me!'\n\n'Catherine, what have you done?' commenced the master.  'Am I nothing to\nyou any more?  Do you love that wretch Heath--'\n\n'Hush!' cried Mrs. Linton.  'Hush, this moment!  You mention that name\nand I end the matter instantly by a spring from the window!  What you\ntouch at present you may have; but my soul will be on that hill-top\nbefore you lay hands on me again.  I don't want you, Edgar: I'm past\nwanting you.  Return to your books.  I'm glad you possess a consolation,\nfor all you had in me is gone.'\n\n'Her mind wanders, sir,' I interposed.  'She has been talking nonsense\nthe whole evening; but let her have quiet, and proper attendance, and\nshe'll rally.  Hereafter, we must be cautious how we vex her.'\n\n'I desire no further advice from you,' answered Mr. Linton.  'You knew\nyour mistress's nature, and you encouraged me to harass her.  And not to\ngive me one hint of how she has been these three days!  It was heartless!\nMonths of sickness could not cause such a change!'\n\nI began to defend myself, thinking it too bad to be blamed for another's\nwicked waywardness.  'I knew Mrs. Linton's nature to be headstrong and\ndomineering,' cried I: 'but I didn't know that you wished to foster her\nfierce temper!  I didn't know that, to humour her, I should wink at Mr.\nHeathcliff.  I performed the duty of a faithful servant in telling you,\nand I have got a faithful servant's wages!  Well, it will teach me to be\ncareful next time.  Next time you may gather intelligence for yourself!'\n\n'The next time you bring a tale to me you shall quit my service, Ellen\nDean,' he replied.\n\n'You'd rather hear nothing about it, I suppose, then, Mr. Linton?' said\nI.  'Heathcliff has your permission to come a-courting to Miss, and to\ndrop in at every opportunity your absence offers, on purpose to poison\nthe mistress against you?'\n\nConfused as Catherine was, her wits were alert at applying our\nconversation.\n\n'Ah!  Nelly has played traitor,' she exclaimed, passionately.  'Nelly is\nmy hidden enemy.  You witch!  So you do seek elf-bolts to hurt us!  Let\nme go, and I'll make her rue!  I'll make her howl a recantation!'\n\nA maniac's fury kindled under her brows; she struggled desperately to\ndisengage herself from Linton's arms.  I felt no inclination to tarry the\nevent; and, resolving to seek medical aid on my own responsibility, I\nquitted the chamber.\n\nIn passing the garden to reach the road, at a place where a bridle hook\nis driven into the wall, I saw something white moved irregularly,\nevidently by another agent than the wind.  Notwithstanding my hurry, I\nstayed to examine it, lest ever after I should have the conviction\nimpressed on my imagination that it was a creature of the other world.  My\nsurprise and perplexity were great on discovering, by touch more than\nvision, Miss Isabella's springer, Fanny, suspended by a handkerchief, and\nnearly at its last gasp.  I quickly released the animal, and lifted it\ninto the garden.  I had seen it follow its mistress up-stairs when she\nwent to bed; and wondered much how it could have got out there, and what\nmischievous person had treated it so.  While untying the knot round the\nhook, it seemed to me that I repeatedly caught the beat of horses' feet\ngalloping at some distance; but there were such a number of things to\noccupy my reflections that I hardly gave the circumstance a thought:\nthough it was a strange sound, in that place, at two o'clock in the\nmorning.\n\nMr. Kenneth was fortunately just issuing from his house to see a patient\nin the village as I came up the street; and my account of Catherine\nLinton's malady induced him to accompany me back immediately.  He was a\nplain rough man; and he made no scruple to speak his doubts of her\nsurviving this second attack; unless she were more submissive to his\ndirections than she had shown herself before.\n\n'Nelly Dean,' said he, 'I can't help fancying there's an extra cause for\nthis.  What has there been to do at the Grange?  We've odd reports up\nhere.  A stout, hearty lass like Catherine does not fall ill for a\ntrifle; and that sort of people should not either.  It's hard work\nbringing them through fevers, and such things.  How did it begin?'\n\n'The master will inform you,' I answered; 'but you are acquainted with\nthe Earnshaws' violent dispositions, and Mrs. Linton caps them all.  I\nmay say this; it commenced in a quarrel.  She was struck during a tempest\nof passion with a kind of fit.  That's her account, at least: for she\nflew off in the height of it, and locked herself up.  Afterwards, she\nrefused to eat, and now she alternately raves and remains in a half\ndream; knowing those about her, but having her mind filled with all sorts\nof strange ideas and illusions.'\n\n'Mr. Linton will be sorry?' observed Kenneth, interrogatively.\n\n'Sorry? he'll break his heart should anything happen!' I replied.  'Don't\nalarm him more than necessary.'\n\n'Well, I told him to beware,' said my companion; 'and he must bide the\nconsequences of neglecting my warning!  Hasn't he been intimate with Mr.\nHeathcliff lately?'\n\n'Heathcliff frequently visits at the Grange,' answered I, 'though more on\nthe strength of the mistress having known him when a boy, than because\nthe master likes his company.  At present he's discharged from the\ntrouble of calling; owing to some presumptuous aspirations after Miss\nLinton which he manifested.  I hardly think he'll be taken in again.'\n\n'And does Miss Linton turn a cold shoulder on him?' was the doctor's next\nquestion.\n\n'I'm not in her confidence,' returned I, reluctant to continue the\nsubject.\n\n'No, she's a sly one,' he remarked, shaking his head.  'She keeps her own\ncounsel!  But she's a real little fool.  I have it from good authority\nthat last night (and a pretty night it was!) she and Heathcliff were\nwalking in the plantation at the back of your house above two hours; and\nhe pressed her not to go in again, but just mount his horse and away with\nhim!  My informant said she could only put him off by pledging her word\nof honour to be prepared on their first meeting after that: when it was\nto be he didn't hear; but you urge Mr. Linton to look sharp!'\n\nThis news filled me with fresh fears; I outstripped Kenneth, and ran most\nof the way back.  The little dog was yelping in the garden yet.  I spared\na minute to open the gate for it, but instead of going to the house door,\nit coursed up and down snuffing the grass, and would have escaped to the\nroad, had I not seized it and conveyed it in with me.  On ascending to\nIsabella's room, my suspicions were confirmed: it was empty.  Had I been\na few hours sooner Mrs. Linton's illness might have arrested her rash\nstep.  But what could be done now?  There was a bare possibility of\novertaking them if pursued instantly.  _I_ could not pursue them,\nhowever; and I dared not rouse the family, and fill the place with\nconfusion; still less unfold the business to my master, absorbed as he\nwas in his present calamity, and having no heart to spare for a second\ngrief!  I saw nothing for it but to hold my tongue, and suffer matters to\ntake their course; and Kenneth being arrived, I went with a badly\ncomposed countenance to announce him.  Catherine lay in a troubled sleep:\nher husband had succeeded in soothing the excess of frenzy; he now hung\nover her pillow, watching every shade and every change of her painfully\nexpressive features.\n\nThe doctor, on examining the case for himself, spoke hopefully to him of\nits having a favourable termination, if we could only preserve around her\nperfect and constant tranquillity.  To me, he signified the threatening\ndanger was not so much death, as permanent alienation of intellect.\n\nI did not close my eyes that night, nor did Mr. Linton: indeed, we never\nwent to bed; and the servants were all up long before the usual hour,\nmoving through the house with stealthy tread, and exchanging whispers as\nthey encountered each other in their vocations.  Every one was active but\nMiss Isabella; and they began to remark how sound she slept: her brother,\ntoo, asked if she had risen, and seemed impatient for her presence, and\nhurt that she showed so little anxiety for her sister-in-law.  I trembled\nlest he should send me to call her; but I was spared the pain of being\nthe first proclaimant of her flight.  One of the maids, a thoughtless\ngirl, who had been on an early errand to Gimmerton, came panting\nup-stairs, open-mouthed, and dashed into the chamber, crying: 'Oh, dear,\ndear!  What mun we have next?  Master, master, our young lady--'\n\n'Hold your noise!' cried, I hastily, enraged at her clamorous manner.\n\n'Speak lower, Mary--What is the matter?' said Mr. Linton.  'What ails\nyour young lady?'\n\n'She's gone, she's gone!  Yon' Heathcliff's run off wi' her!' gasped the\ngirl.\n\n'That is not true!' exclaimed Linton, rising in agitation.  'It cannot\nbe: how has the idea entered your head?  Ellen Dean, go and seek her.  It\nis incredible: it cannot be.'\n\nAs he spoke he took the servant to the door, and then repeated his demand\nto know her reasons for such an assertion.\n\n'Why, I met on the road a lad that fetches milk here,' she stammered,\n'and he asked whether we weren't in trouble at the Grange.  I thought he\nmeant for missis's sickness, so I answered, yes.  Then says he, \"There's\nsomebody gone after 'em, I guess?\"  I stared.  He saw I knew nought about\nit, and he told how a gentleman and lady had stopped to have a horse's\nshoe fastened at a blacksmith's shop, two miles out of Gimmerton, not\nvery long after midnight! and how the blacksmith's lass had got up to spy\nwho they were: she knew them both directly.  And she noticed the\nman--Heathcliff it was, she felt certain: nob'dy could mistake him,\nbesides--put a sovereign in her father's hand for payment.  The lady had\na cloak about her face; but having desired a sup of water, while she\ndrank it fell back, and she saw her very plain.  Heathcliff held both\nbridles as they rode on, and they set their faces from the village, and\nwent as fast as the rough roads would let them.  The lass said nothing to\nher father, but she told it all over Gimmerton this morning.'\n\nI ran and peeped, for form's sake, into Isabella's room; confirming, when\nI returned, the servant's statement.  Mr. Linton had resumed his seat by\nthe bed; on my re-entrance, he raised his eyes, read the meaning of my\nblank aspect, and dropped them without giving an order, or uttering a\nword.\n\n'Are we to try any measures for overtaking and bringing her back,' I\ninquired.  'How should we do?'\n\n'She went of her own accord,' answered the master; 'she had a right to go\nif she pleased.  Trouble me no more about her.  Hereafter she is only my\nsister in name: not because I disown her, but because she has disowned\nme.'\n\nAnd that was all he said on the subject: he did not make single inquiry\nfurther, or mention her in any way, except directing me to send what\nproperty she had in the house to her fresh home, wherever it was, when I\nknew it.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII\n\n\nFor two months the fugitives remained absent; in those two months, Mrs.\nLinton encountered and conquered the worst shock of what was denominated\na brain fever.  No mother could have nursed an only child more devotedly\nthan Edgar tended her.  Day and night he was watching, and patiently\nenduring all the annoyances that irritable nerves and a shaken reason\ncould inflict; and, though Kenneth remarked that what he saved from the\ngrave would only recompense his care by forming the source of constant\nfuture anxiety--in fact, that his health and strength were being\nsacrificed to preserve a mere ruin of humanity--he knew no limits in\ngratitude and joy when Catherine's life was declared out of danger; and\nhour after hour he would sit beside her, tracing the gradual return to\nbodily health, and flattering his too sanguine hopes with the illusion\nthat her mind would settle back to its right balance also, and she would\nsoon be entirely her former self.\n\nThe first time she left her chamber was at the commencement of the\nfollowing March.  Mr. Linton had put on her pillow, in the morning, a\nhandful of golden crocuses; her eye, long stranger to any gleam of\npleasure, caught them in waking, and shone delighted as she gathered them\neagerly together.\n\n'These are the earliest flowers at the Heights,' she exclaimed.  'They\nremind me of soft thaw winds, and warm sunshine, and nearly melted snow.\nEdgar, is there not a south wind, and is not the snow almost gone?'\n\n'The snow is quite gone down here, darling,' replied her husband; 'and I\nonly see two white spots on the whole range of moors: the sky is blue,\nand the larks are singing, and the becks and brooks are all brim full.\nCatherine, last spring at this time, I was longing to have you under this\nroof; now, I wish you were a mile or two up those hills: the air blows so\nsweetly, I feel that it would cure you.'\n\n'I shall never be there but once more,' said the invalid; 'and then\nyou'll leave me, and I shall remain for ever.  Next spring you'll long\nagain to have me under this roof, and you'll look back and think you were\nhappy to-day.'\n\nLinton lavished on her the kindest caresses, and tried to cheer her by\nthe fondest words; but, vaguely regarding the flowers, she let the tears\ncollect on her lashes and stream down her cheeks unheeding.  We knew she\nwas really better, and, therefore, decided that long confinement to a\nsingle place produced much of this despondency, and it might be partially\nremoved by a change of scene.  The master told me to light a fire in the\nmany-weeks' deserted parlour, and to set an easy-chair in the sunshine by\nthe window; and then he brought her down, and she sat a long while\nenjoying the genial heat, and, as we expected, revived by the objects\nround her: which, though familiar, were free from the dreary associations\ninvesting her hated sick chamber.  By evening she seemed greatly\nexhausted; yet no arguments could persuade her to return to that\napartment, and I had to arrange the parlour sofa for her bed, till\nanother room could be prepared.  To obviate the fatigue of mounting and\ndescending the stairs, we fitted up this, where you lie at present--on\nthe same floor with the parlour; and she was soon strong enough to move\nfrom one to the other, leaning on Edgar's arm.  Ah, I thought myself, she\nmight recover, so waited on as she was.  And there was double cause to\ndesire it, for on her existence depended that of another: we cherished\nthe hope that in a little while Mr. Linton's heart would be gladdened,\nand his lands secured from a stranger's gripe, by the birth of an heir.\n\nI should mention that Isabella sent to her brother, some six weeks from\nher departure, a short note, announcing her marriage with Heathcliff.  It\nappeared dry and cold; but at the bottom was dotted in with pencil an\nobscure apology, and an entreaty for kind remembrance and reconciliation,\nif her proceeding had offended him: asserting that she could not help it\nthen, and being done, she had now no power to repeal it.  Linton did not\nreply to this, I believe; and, in a fortnight more, I got a long letter,\nwhich I considered odd, coming from the pen of a bride just out of the\nhoneymoon.  I'll read it: for I keep it yet.  Any relic of the dead is\nprecious, if they were valued living.\n\n* * * * *\n\nDEAR ELLEN, it begins,--I came last night to Wuthering Heights, and\nheard, for the first time, that Catherine has been, and is yet, very ill.\nI must not write to her, I suppose, and my brother is either too angry or\ntoo distressed to answer what I sent him.  Still, I must write to\nsomebody, and the only choice left me is you.\n\nInform Edgar that I'd give the world to see his face again--that my heart\nreturned to Thrushcross Grange in twenty-four hours after I left it, and\nis there at this moment, full of warm feelings for him, and Catherine!  _I\ncan't follow it though_--(these words are underlined)--they need not\nexpect me, and they may draw what conclusions they please; taking care,\nhowever, to lay nothing at the door of my weak will or deficient\naffection.\n\nThe remainder of the letter is for yourself alone.  I want to ask you two\nquestions: the first is,--How did you contrive to preserve the common\nsympathies of human nature when you resided here?  I cannot recognise any\nsentiment which those around share with me.\n\nThe second question I have great interest in; it is this--Is Mr.\nHeathcliff a man?  If so, is he mad?  And if not, is he a devil?  I\nsha'n't tell my reasons for making this inquiry; but I beseech you to\nexplain, if you can, what I have married: that is, when you call to see\nme; and you must call, Ellen, very soon.  Don't write, but come, and\nbring me something from Edgar.\n\nNow, you shall hear how I have been received in my new home, as I am led\nto imagine the Heights will be.  It is to amuse myself that I dwell on\nsuch subjects as the lack of external comforts: they never occupy my\nthoughts, except at the moment when I miss them.  I should laugh and\ndance for joy, if I found their absence was the total of my miseries, and\nthe rest was an unnatural dream!\n\nThe sun set behind the Grange as we turned on to the moors; by that, I\njudged it to be six o'clock; and my companion halted half an hour, to\ninspect the park, and the gardens, and, probably, the place itself, as\nwell as he could; so it was dark when we dismounted in the paved yard of\nthe farm-house, and your old fellow-servant, Joseph, issued out to\nreceive us by the light of a dip candle.  He did it with a courtesy that\nredounded to his credit.  His first act was to elevate his torch to a\nlevel with my face, squint malignantly, project his under-lip, and turn\naway.  Then he took the two horses, and led them into the stables;\nreappearing for the purpose of locking the outer gate, as if we lived in\nan ancient castle.\n\nHeathcliff stayed to speak to him, and I entered the kitchen--a dingy,\nuntidy hole; I daresay you would not know it, it is so changed since it\nwas in your charge.  By the fire stood a ruffianly child, strong in limb\nand dirty in garb, with a look of Catherine in his eyes and about his\nmouth.\n\n'This is Edgar's legal nephew,' I reflected--'mine in a manner; I must\nshake hands, and--yes--I must kiss him.  It is right to establish a good\nunderstanding at the beginning.'\n\nI approached, and, attempting to take his chubby fist, said--'How do you\ndo, my dear?'\n\nHe replied in a jargon I did not comprehend.\n\n'Shall you and I be friends, Hareton?' was my next essay at conversation.\n\nAn oath, and a threat to set Throttler on me if I did not 'frame off'\nrewarded my perseverance.\n\n'Hey, Throttler, lad!' whispered the little wretch, rousing a half-bred\nbull-dog from its lair in a corner.  'Now, wilt thou be ganging?' he\nasked authoritatively.\n\nLove for my life urged a compliance; I stepped over the threshold to wait\ntill the others should enter.  Mr. Heathcliff was nowhere visible; and\nJoseph, whom I followed to the stables, and requested to accompany me in,\nafter staring and muttering to himself, screwed up his nose and\nreplied--'Mim! mim! mim!  Did iver Christian body hear aught like it?\nMincing un' munching!  How can I tell whet ye say?'\n\n'I say, I wish you to come with me into the house!' I cried, thinking him\ndeaf, yet highly disgusted at his rudeness.\n\n'None o' me!  I getten summut else to do,' he answered, and continued his\nwork; moving his lantern jaws meanwhile, and surveying my dress and\ncountenance (the former a great deal too fine, but the latter, I'm sure,\nas sad as he could desire) with sovereign contempt.\n\nI walked round the yard, and through a wicket, to another door, at which\nI took the liberty of knocking, in hopes some more civil servant might\nshow himself.  After a short suspense, it was opened by a tall, gaunt\nman, without neckerchief, and otherwise extremely slovenly; his features\nwere lost in masses of shaggy hair that hung on his shoulders; and _his_\neyes, too, were like a ghostly Catherine's with all their beauty\nannihilated.\n\n'What's your business here?' he demanded, grimly.  'Who are you?'\n\n'My name was Isabella Linton,' I replied.  'You've seen me before, sir.\nI'm lately married to Mr. Heathcliff, and he has brought me here--I\nsuppose, by your permission.'\n\n'Is he come back, then?' asked the hermit, glaring like a hungry wolf.\n\n'Yes--we came just now,' I said; 'but he left me by the kitchen door; and\nwhen I would have gone in, your little boy played sentinel over the\nplace, and frightened me off by the help of a bull-dog.'\n\n'It's well the hellish villain has kept his word!' growled my future\nhost, searching the darkness beyond me in expectation of discovering\nHeathcliff; and then he indulged in a soliloquy of execrations, and\nthreats of what he would have done had the 'fiend' deceived him.\n\nI repented having tried this second entrance, and was almost inclined to\nslip away before he finished cursing, but ere I could execute that\nintention, he ordered me in, and shut and re-fastened the door.  There\nwas a great fire, and that was all the light in the huge apartment, whose\nfloor had grown a uniform grey; and the once brilliant pewter-dishes,\nwhich used to attract my gaze when I was a girl, partook of a similar\nobscurity, created by tarnish and dust.  I inquired whether I might call\nthe maid, and be conducted to a bedroom!  Mr. Earnshaw vouchsafed no\nanswer.  He walked up and down, with his hands in his pockets, apparently\nquite forgetting my presence; and his abstraction was evidently so deep,\nand his whole aspect so misanthropical, that I shrank from disturbing him\nagain.\n\nYou'll not be surprised, Ellen, at my feeling particularly cheerless,\nseated in worse than solitude on that inhospitable hearth, and\nremembering that four miles distant lay my delightful home, containing\nthe only people I loved on earth; and there might as well be the\nAtlantic to part us, instead of those four miles: I could not overpass\nthem! I questioned with myself--where must I turn for comfort? and--mind\nyou don't tell Edgar, or Catherine--above every sorrow beside, this rose\npre-eminent: despair at finding nobody who could or would be my ally\nagainst Heathcliff! I had sought shelter at Wuthering Heights, almost\ngladly, because I was secured by that arrangement from living alone with\nhim; but he knew the people we were coming amongst, and he did not fear\ntheir intermeddling.\n\nI sat and thought a doleful time: the clock struck eight, and nine, and\nstill my companion paced to and fro, his head bent on his breast, and\nperfectly silent, unless a groan or a bitter ejaculation forced itself\nout at intervals.  I listened to detect a woman's voice in the house, and\nfilled the interim with wild regrets and dismal anticipations, which, at\nlast, spoke audibly in irrepressible sighing and weeping.  I was not\naware how openly I grieved, till Earnshaw halted opposite, in his\nmeasured walk, and gave me a stare of newly-awakened surprise.  Taking\nadvantage of his recovered attention, I exclaimed--'I'm tired with my\njourney, and I want to go to bed!  Where is the maid-servant?  Direct me\nto her, as she won't come to me!'\n\n'We have none,' he answered; 'you must wait on yourself!'\n\n'Where must I sleep, then?' I sobbed; I was beyond regarding\nself-respect, weighed down by fatigue and wretchedness.\n\n'Joseph will show you Heathcliff's chamber,' said he; 'open that\ndoor--he's in there.'\n\nI was going to obey, but he suddenly arrested me, and added in the\nstrangest tone--'Be so good as to turn your lock, and draw your\nbolt--don't omit it!'\n\n'Well!' I said.  'But why, Mr. Earnshaw?'  I did not relish the notion of\ndeliberately fastening myself in with Heathcliff.\n\n'Look here!' he replied, pulling from his waistcoat a\ncuriously-constructed pistol, having a double-edged spring knife attached\nto the barrel.  'That's a great tempter to a desperate man, is it not?  I\ncannot resist going up with this every night, and trying his door.  If\nonce I find it open he's done for; I do it invariably, even though the\nminute before I have been recalling a hundred reasons that should make me\nrefrain: it is some devil that urges me to thwart my own schemes by\nkilling him.  You fight against that devil for love as long as you may;\nwhen the time comes, not all the angels in heaven shall save him!'\n\nI surveyed the weapon inquisitively.  A hideous notion struck me: how\npowerful I should be possessing such an instrument!  I took it from his\nhand, and touched the blade.  He looked astonished at the expression my\nface assumed during a brief second: it was not horror, it was\ncovetousness.  He snatched the pistol back, jealously; shut the knife,\nand returned it to its concealment.\n\n'I don't care if you tell him,' said he.  'Put him on his guard, and\nwatch for him.  You know the terms we are on, I see: his danger does not\nshock you.'\n\n'What has Heathcliff done to you?' I asked.  'In what has he wronged you,\nto warrant this appalling hatred?  Wouldn't it be wiser to bid him quit\nthe house?'\n\n'No!' thundered Earnshaw; 'should he offer to leave me, he's a dead man:\npersuade him to attempt it, and you are a murderess!  Am I to lose _all_,\nwithout a chance of retrieval?  Is Hareton to be a beggar?  Oh,\ndamnation!  I _will_ have it back; and I'll have _his_ gold too; and then\nhis blood; and hell shall have his soul!  It will be ten times blacker\nwith that guest than ever it was before!'\n\nYou've acquainted me, Ellen, with your old master's habits.  He is\nclearly on the verge of madness: he was so last night at least.  I\nshuddered to be near him, and thought on the servant's ill-bred\nmoroseness as comparatively agreeable.  He now recommenced his moody\nwalk, and I raised the latch, and escaped into the kitchen.  Joseph was\nbending over the fire, peering into a large pan that swung above it; and\na wooden bowl of oatmeal stood on the settle close by.  The contents of\nthe pan began to boil, and he turned to plunge his hand into the bowl; I\nconjectured that this preparation was probably for our supper, and, being\nhungry, I resolved it should be eatable; so, crying out sharply, '_I'll_\nmake the porridge!'  I removed the vessel out of his reach, and proceeded\nto take off my hat and riding-habit.  'Mr. Earnshaw,' I continued,\n'directs me to wait on myself: I will.  I'm not going to act the lady\namong you, for fear I should starve.'\n\n'Gooid Lord!' he muttered, sitting down, and stroking his ribbed\nstockings from the knee to the ankle.  'If there's to be fresh\northerings--just when I getten used to two maisters, if I mun hev' a\n_mistress_ set o'er my heead, it's like time to be flitting.  I niver\n_did_ think to see t' day that I mud lave th' owld place--but I doubt\nit's nigh at hand!'\n\nThis lamentation drew no notice from me: I went briskly to work, sighing\nto remember a period when it would have been all merry fun; but compelled\nspeedily to drive off the remembrance.  It racked me to recall past\nhappiness and the greater peril there was of conjuring up its apparition,\nthe quicker the thible ran round, and the faster the handfuls of meal\nfell into the water.  Joseph beheld my style of cookery with growing\nindignation.\n\n'Thear!' he ejaculated.  'Hareton, thou willn't sup thy porridge\nto-neeght; they'll be naught but lumps as big as my neive.  Thear, agean!\nI'd fling in bowl un' all, if I wer ye!  There, pale t' guilp off, un'\nthen ye'll hae done wi' 't.  Bang, bang.  It's a mercy t' bothom isn't\ndeaved out!'\n\nIt _was_ rather a rough mess, I own, when poured into the basins; four\nhad been provided, and a gallon pitcher of new milk was brought from the\ndairy, which Hareton seized and commenced drinking and spilling from the\nexpansive lip.  I expostulated, and desired that he should have his in a\nmug; affirming that I could not taste the liquid treated so dirtily.  The\nold cynic chose to be vastly offended at this nicety; assuring me,\nrepeatedly, that 'the barn was every bit as good' as I, 'and every bit as\nwollsome,' and wondering how I could fashion to be so conceited.\nMeanwhile, the infant ruffian continued sucking; and glowered up at me\ndefyingly, as he slavered into the jug.\n\n'I shall have my supper in another room,' I said.  'Have you no place you\ncall a parlour?'\n\n'_Parlour_!' he echoed, sneeringly, '_parlour_!  Nay, we've noa\n_parlours_.  If yah dunnut loike wer company, there's maister's; un' if\nyah dunnut loike maister, there's us.'\n\n'Then I shall go up-stairs,' I answered; 'show me a chamber.'\n\nI put my basin on a tray, and went myself to fetch some more milk.  With\ngreat grumblings, the fellow rose, and preceded me in my ascent: we\nmounted to the garrets; he opened a door, now and then, to look into the\napartments we passed.\n\n'Here's a rahm,' he said, at last, flinging back a cranky board on\nhinges.  'It's weel eneugh to ate a few porridge in.  There's a pack o'\ncorn i' t' corner, thear, meeterly clane; if ye're feared o' muckying yer\ngrand silk cloes, spread yer hankerchir o' t' top on't.'\n\nThe 'rahm' was a kind of lumber-hole smelling strong of malt and grain;\nvarious sacks of which articles were piled around, leaving a wide, bare\nspace in the middle.\n\n'Why, man,' I exclaimed, facing him angrily, 'this is not a place to\nsleep in.  I wish to see my bed-room.'\n\n'_Bed-rume_!' he repeated, in a tone of mockery. 'Yah's see all t'\n_bed-rumes_ thear is--yon's mine.'\n\nHe pointed into the second garret, only differing from the first in being\nmore naked about the walls, and having a large, low, curtainless bed,\nwith an indigo-coloured quilt, at one end.\n\n'What do I want with yours?' I retorted.  'I suppose Mr. Heathcliff does\nnot lodge at the top of the house, does he?'\n\n'Oh! it's Maister _Hathecliff's_ ye're wanting?' cried he, as if making a\nnew discovery.  'Couldn't ye ha' said soa, at onst? un' then, I mud ha'\ntelled ye, baht all this wark, that that's just one ye cannut see--he\nallas keeps it locked, un' nob'dy iver mells on't but hisseln.'\n\n'You've a nice house, Joseph,' I could not refrain from observing, 'and\npleasant inmates; and I think the concentrated essence of all the madness\nin the world took up its abode in my brain the day I linked my fate with\ntheirs!  However, that is not to the present purpose--there are other\nrooms.  For heaven's sake be quick, and let me settle somewhere!'\n\nHe made no reply to this adjuration; only plodding doggedly down the\nwooden steps, and halting, before an apartment which, from that halt and\nthe superior quality of its furniture, I conjectured to be the best one.\nThere was a carpet--a good one, but the pattern was obliterated by dust;\na fireplace hung with cut-paper, dropping to pieces; a handsome\noak-bedstead with ample crimson curtains of rather expensive material and\nmodern make; but they had evidently experienced rough usage: the\nvallances hung in festoons, wrenched from their rings, and the iron rod\nsupporting them was bent in an arc on one side, causing the drapery to\ntrail upon the floor.  The chairs were also damaged, many of them\nseverely; and deep indentations deformed the panels of the walls.  I was\nendeavouring to gather resolution for entering and taking possession,\nwhen my fool of a guide announced,--'This here is t' maister's.'  My\nsupper by this time was cold, my appetite gone, and my patience\nexhausted.  I insisted on being provided instantly with a place of\nrefuge, and means of repose.\n\n'Whear the divil?' began the religious elder.  'The Lord bless us!  The\nLord forgie us!  Whear the _hell_ wold ye gang? ye marred, wearisome\nnowt!  Ye've seen all but Hareton's bit of a cham'er.  There's not\nanother hoile to lig down in i' th' hahse!'\n\nI was so vexed, I flung my tray and its contents on the ground; and then\nseated myself at the stairs'-head, hid my face in my hands, and cried.\n\n'Ech! ech!' exclaimed Joseph.  'Weel done, Miss Cathy! weel done, Miss\nCathy!  Howsiver, t' maister sall just tum'le o'er them brooken pots; un'\nthen we's hear summut; we's hear how it's to be.  Gooid-for-naught\nmadling! ye desarve pining fro' this to Chrustmas, flinging t' precious\ngifts o'God under fooit i' yer flaysome rages!  But I'm mista'en if ye\nshew yer sperrit lang.  Will Hathecliff bide sich bonny ways, think ye? I\nnobbut wish he may catch ye i' that plisky.  I nobbut wish he may.'\n\nAnd so he went on scolding to his den beneath, taking the candle with\nhim; and I remained in the dark. The period of reflection succeeding\nthis silly action compelled me to admit the necessity of smothering my\npride and choking my wrath, and bestirring myself to remove its effects.\nAn unexpected aid presently appeared in the shape of Throttler, whom I\nnow recognised as a son of our old Skulker: it had spent its whelphood\nat the Grange, and was given by my father to Mr. Hindley. I fancy it\nknew me: it pushed its nose against mine by way of salute, and then\nhastened to devour the porridge; while I groped from step to step,\ncollecting the shattered earthenware, and drying the spatters of milk\nfrom the banister with my pocket-handkerchief. Our labours were scarcely\nover when I heard Earnshaw's tread in the passage; my assistant tucked\nin his tail, and pressed to the wall; I stole into the nearest doorway.\nThe dog's endeavour to avoid him was unsuccessful; as I guessed by a\nscutter down-stairs, and a prolonged, piteous yelping. I had better\nluck: he passed on, entered his chamber, and shut the door. Directly\nafter Joseph came up with Hareton, to put him to bed. I had found\nshelter in Hareton's room, and the old man, on seeing me, said,--'They's\nrahm for boath ye un' yer pride, now, I sud think i' the hahse. It's\nempty; ye may hev' it all to yerseln, un' Him as allus maks a third, i'\nsich ill company!'\n\nGladly did I take advantage of this intimation; and the minute I flung\nmyself into a chair, by the fire, I nodded, and slept.  My slumber was\ndeep and sweet, though over far too soon.  Mr. Heathcliff awoke me; he\nhad just come in, and demanded, in his loving manner, what I was doing\nthere?  I told him the cause of my staying up so late--that he had the\nkey of our room in his pocket.  The adjective _our_ gave mortal offence.\nHe swore it was not, nor ever should be, mine; and he'd--but I'll not\nrepeat his language, nor describe his habitual conduct: he is ingenious\nand unresting in seeking to gain my abhorrence!  I sometimes wonder at\nhim with an intensity that deadens my fear: yet, I assure you, a tiger or\na venomous serpent could not rouse terror in me equal to that which he\nwakens.  He told me of Catherine's illness, and accused my brother of\ncausing it promising that I should be Edgar's proxy in suffering, till he\ncould get hold of him.\n\nI do hate him--I am wretched--I have been a fool!  Beware of uttering one\nbreath of this to any one at the Grange.  I shall expect you every\nday--don't disappoint me!--ISABELLA.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV\n\n\nAs soon as I had perused this epistle I went to the master, and informed\nhim that his sister had arrived at the Heights, and sent me a letter\nexpressing her sorrow for Mrs. Linton's situation, and her ardent desire\nto see him; with a wish that he would transmit to her, as early as\npossible, some token of forgiveness by me.\n\n'Forgiveness!' said Linton.  'I have nothing to forgive her, Ellen.  You\nmay call at Wuthering Heights this afternoon, if you like, and say that I\nam not angry, but I'm sorry to have lost her; especially as I can never\nthink she'll be happy.  It is out of the question my going to see her,\nhowever: we are eternally divided; and should she really wish to oblige\nme, let her persuade the villain she has married to leave the country.'\n\n'And you won't write her a little note, sir?' I asked, imploringly.\n\n'No,' he answered.  'It is needless.  My communication with Heathcliff's\nfamily shall be as sparing as his with mine.  It shall not exist!'\n\nMr. Edgar's coldness depressed me exceedingly; and all the way from the\nGrange I puzzled my brains how to put more heart into what he said, when\nI repeated it; and how to soften his refusal of even a few lines to\nconsole Isabella. I daresay she had been on the watch for me since\nmorning: I saw her looking through the lattice as I came up the garden\ncauseway, and I nodded to her; but she drew back, as if afraid of being\nobserved. I entered without knocking. There never was such a dreary,\ndismal scene as the formerly cheerful house presented! I must confess,\nthat if I had been in the young lady's place, I would, at least, have\nswept the hearth, and wiped the tables with a duster. But she already\npartook of the pervading spirit of neglect which encompassed her. Her\npretty face was wan and listless; her hair uncurled: some locks hanging\nlankly down, and some carelessly twisted round her head. Probably she\nhad not touched her dress since yester evening. Hindley was not there.\nMr. Heathcliff sat at a table, turning over some papers in his\npocket-book; but he rose when I appeared, asked me how I did, quite\nfriendly, and offered me a chair. He was the only thing there that\nseemed decent; and I thought he never looked better. So much had\ncircumstances altered their positions, that he would certainly have\nstruck a stranger as a born and bred gentleman; and his wife as a\nthorough little slattern! She came forward eagerly to greet me, and held\nout one hand to take the expected letter. I shook my head. She wouldn't\nunderstand the hint, but followed me to a sideboard, where I went to lay\nmy bonnet, and importuned me in a whisper to give her directly what I\nhad brought. Heathcliff guessed the meaning of her manoeuvres, and\nsaid--'If you have got anything for Isabella (as no doubt you have,\nNelly), give it to her. You needn't make a secret of it: we have no\nsecrets between us.'\n\n'Oh, I have nothing,' I replied, thinking it best to speak the truth at\nonce.  'My master bid me tell his sister that she must not expect either\na letter or a visit from him at present.  He sends his love, ma'am, and\nhis wishes for your happiness, and his pardon for the grief you have\noccasioned; but he thinks that after this time his household and the\nhousehold here should drop intercommunication, as nothing could come of\nkeeping it up.'\n\nMrs. Heathcliff's lip quivered slightly, and she returned to her seat in\nthe window.  Her husband took his stand on the hearthstone, near me, and\nbegan to put questions concerning Catherine.  I told him as much as I\nthought proper of her illness, and he extorted from me, by\ncross-examination, most of the facts connected with its origin.  I blamed\nher, as she deserved, for bringing it all on herself; and ended by hoping\nthat he would follow Mr. Linton's example and avoid future interference\nwith his family, for good or evil.\n\n'Mrs. Linton is now just recovering,' I said; 'she'll never be like she\nwas, but her life is spared; and if you really have a regard for her,\nyou'll shun crossing her way again: nay, you'll move out of this country\nentirely; and that you may not regret it, I'll inform you Catherine\nLinton is as different now from your old friend Catherine Earnshaw, as\nthat young lady is different from me.  Her appearance is changed greatly,\nher character much more so; and the person who is compelled, of\nnecessity, to be her companion, will only sustain his affection hereafter\nby the remembrance of what she once was, by common humanity, and a sense\nof duty!'\n\n'That is quite possible,' remarked Heathcliff, forcing himself to seem\ncalm: 'quite possible that your master should have nothing but common\nhumanity and a sense of duty to fall back upon.  But do you imagine that\nI shall leave Catherine to his _duty_ and _humanity_? and can you compare\nmy feelings respecting Catherine to his?  Before you leave this house, I\nmust exact a promise from you that you'll get me an interview with her:\nconsent, or refuse, I _will_ see her!  What do you say?'\n\n'I say, Mr. Heathcliff,' I replied, 'you must not: you never shall,\nthrough my means.  Another encounter between you and the master would\nkill her altogether.'\n\n'With your aid that may be avoided,' he continued; 'and should there be\ndanger of such an event--should he be the cause of adding a single\ntrouble more to her existence--why, I think I shall be justified in going\nto extremes!  I wish you had sincerity enough to tell me whether\nCatherine would suffer greatly from his loss: the fear that she would\nrestrains me.  And there you see the distinction between our feelings:\nhad he been in my place, and I in his, though I hated him with a hatred\nthat turned my life to gall, I never would have raised a hand against\nhim.  You may look incredulous, if you please!  I never would have\nbanished him from her society as long as she desired his.  The moment her\nregard ceased, I would have torn his heart out, and drunk his blood!  But,\ntill then--if you don't believe me, you don't know me--till then, I would\nhave died by inches before I touched a single hair of his head!'\n\n'And yet,' I interrupted, 'you have no scruples in completely ruining all\nhopes of her perfect restoration, by thrusting yourself into her\nremembrance now, when she has nearly forgotten you, and involving her in\na new tumult of discord and distress.'\n\n'You suppose she has nearly forgotten me?' he said.  'Oh, Nelly! you know\nshe has not!  You know as well as I do, that for every thought she spends\non Linton she spends a thousand on me!  At a most miserable period of my\nlife, I had a notion of the kind: it haunted me on my return to the\nneighbourhood last summer; but only her own assurance could make me admit\nthe horrible idea again.  And then, Linton would be nothing, nor Hindley,\nnor all the dreams that ever I dreamt.  Two words would comprehend my\nfuture--_death_ and _hell_: existence, after losing her, would be hell.\nYet I was a fool to fancy for a moment that she valued Edgar Linton's\nattachment more than mine.  If he loved with all the powers of his puny\nbeing, he couldn't love as much in eighty years as I could in a day.  And\nCatherine has a heart as deep as I have: the sea could be as readily\ncontained in that horse-trough as her whole affection be monopolised by\nhim.  Tush!  He is scarcely a degree dearer to her than her dog, or her\nhorse.  It is not in him to be loved like me: how can she love in him\nwhat he has not?'\n\n'Catherine and Edgar are as fond of each other as any two people can be,'\ncried Isabella, with sudden vivacity.  'No one has a right to talk in\nthat manner, and I won't hear my brother depreciated in silence!'\n\n'Your brother is wondrous fond of you too, isn't he?' observed\nHeathcliff, scornfully.  'He turns you adrift on the world with\nsurprising alacrity.'\n\n'He is not aware of what I suffer,' she replied.  'I didn't tell him\nthat.'\n\n'You have been telling him something, then: you have written, have you?'\n\n'To say that I was married, I did write--you saw the note.'\n\n'And nothing since?'\n\n'No.'\n\n'My young lady is looking sadly the worse for her change of condition,' I\nremarked.  'Somebody's love comes short in her case, obviously; whose, I\nmay guess; but, perhaps, I shouldn't say.'\n\n'I should guess it was her own,' said Heathcliff.  'She degenerates into\na mere slut!  She is tired of trying to please me uncommonly early.  You'd\nhardly credit it, but the very morrow of our wedding she was weeping to\ngo home.  However, she'll suit this house so much the better for not\nbeing over nice, and I'll take care she does not disgrace me by rambling\nabroad.'\n\n'Well, sir,' returned I, 'I hope you'll consider that Mrs. Heathcliff is\naccustomed to be looked after and waited on; and that she has been\nbrought up like an only daughter, whom every one was ready to serve.  You\nmust let her have a maid to keep things tidy about her, and you must\ntreat her kindly.  Whatever be your notion of Mr. Edgar, you cannot doubt\nthat she has a capacity for strong attachments, or she wouldn't have\nabandoned the elegancies, and comforts, and friends of her former home,\nto fix contentedly, in such a wilderness as this, with you.'\n\n'She abandoned them under a delusion,' he answered; 'picturing in me a\nhero of romance, and expecting unlimited indulgences from my chivalrous\ndevotion.  I can hardly regard her in the light of a rational creature,\nso obstinately has she persisted in forming a fabulous notion of my\ncharacter and acting on the false impressions she cherished.  But, at\nlast, I think she begins to know me: I don't perceive the silly smiles\nand grimaces that provoked me at first; and the senseless incapability of\ndiscerning that I was in earnest when I gave her my opinion of her\ninfatuation and herself.  It was a marvellous effort of perspicacity to\ndiscover that I did not love her.  I believed, at one time, no lessons\ncould teach her that!  And yet it is poorly learnt; for this morning she\nannounced, as a piece of appalling intelligence, that I had actually\nsucceeded in making her hate me!  A positive labour of Hercules, I assure\nyou!  If it be achieved, I have cause to return thanks.  Can I trust your\nassertion, Isabella?  Are you sure you hate me?  If I let you alone for\nhalf a day, won't you come sighing and wheedling to me again?  I daresay\nshe would rather I had seemed all tenderness before you: it wounds her\nvanity to have the truth exposed.  But I don't care who knows that the\npassion was wholly on one side: and I never told her a lie about it.  She\ncannot accuse me of showing one bit of deceitful softness.  The first\nthing she saw me do, on coming out of the Grange, was to hang up her\nlittle dog; and when she pleaded for it, the first words I uttered were a\nwish that I had the hanging of every being belonging to her, except one:\npossibly she took that exception for herself.  But no brutality disgusted\nher: I suppose she has an innate admiration of it, if only her precious\nperson were secure from injury!  Now, was it not the depth of\nabsurdity--of genuine idiotcy, for that pitiful, slavish, mean-minded\nbrach to dream that I could love her?  Tell your master, Nelly, that I\nnever, in all my life, met with such an abject thing as she is.  She even\ndisgraces the name of Linton; and I've sometimes relented, from pure lack\nof invention, in my experiments on what she could endure, and still creep\nshamefully cringing back!  But tell him, also, to set his fraternal and\nmagisterial heart at ease: that I keep strictly within the limits of the\nlaw.  I have avoided, up to this period, giving her the slightest right\nto claim a separation; and, what's more, she'd thank nobody for dividing\nus.  If she desired to go, she might: the nuisance of her presence\noutweighs the gratification to be derived from tormenting her!'\n\n'Mr. Heathcliff,' said I, 'this is the talk of a madman; your wife, most\nlikely, is convinced you are mad; and, for that reason, she has borne\nwith you hitherto: but now that you say she may go, she'll doubtless\navail herself of the permission.  You are not so bewitched, ma'am, are\nyou, as to remain with him of your own accord?'\n\n'Take care, Ellen!' answered Isabella, her eyes sparkling irefully; there\nwas no misdoubting by their expression the full success of her partner's\nendeavours to make himself detested.  'Don't put faith in a single word\nhe speaks.  He's a lying fiend! a monster, and not a human being!  I've\nbeen told I might leave him before; and I've made the attempt, but I dare\nnot repeat it!  Only, Ellen, promise you'll not mention a syllable of his\ninfamous conversation to my brother or Catherine.  Whatever he may\npretend, he wishes to provoke Edgar to desperation: he says he has\nmarried me on purpose to obtain power over him; and he sha'n't obtain\nit--I'll die first!  I just hope, I pray, that he may forget his\ndiabolical prudence and kill me!  The single pleasure I can imagine is to\ndie, or to see him dead!'\n\n'There--that will do for the present!' said Heathcliff.  'If you are\ncalled upon in a court of law, you'll remember her language, Nelly!  And\ntake a good look at that countenance: she's near the point which would\nsuit me.  No; you're not fit to be your own guardian, Isabella, now; and\nI, being your legal protector, must retain you in my custody, however\ndistasteful the obligation may be.  Go up-stairs; I have something to say\nto Ellen Dean in private.  That's not the way: up-stairs, I tell you!\nWhy, this is the road upstairs, child!'\n\nHe seized, and thrust her from the room; and returned muttering--'I have\nno pity!  I have no pity!  The more the worms writhe, the more I yearn to\ncrush out their entrails!  It is a moral teething; and I grind with\ngreater energy in proportion to the increase of pain.'\n\n'Do you understand what the word pity means?' I said, hastening to resume\nmy bonnet.  'Did you ever feel a touch of it in your life?'\n\n'Put that down!' he interrupted, perceiving my intention to depart.  'You\nare not going yet.  Come here now, Nelly: I must either persuade or\ncompel you to aid me in fulfilling my determination to see Catherine, and\nthat without delay.  I swear that I meditate no harm: I don't desire to\ncause any disturbance, or to exasperate or insult Mr. Linton; I only wish\nto hear from herself how she is, and why she has been ill; and to ask if\nanything that I could do would be of use to her.  Last night I was in the\nGrange garden six hours, and I'll return there to-night; and every night\nI'll haunt the place, and every day, till I find an opportunity of\nentering.  If Edgar Linton meets me, I shall not hesitate to knock him\ndown, and give him enough to insure his quiescence while I stay.  If his\nservants oppose me, I shall threaten them off with these pistols.  But\nwouldn't it be better to prevent my coming in contact with them, or their\nmaster?  And you could do it so easily.  I'd warn you when I came, and\nthen you might let me in unobserved, as soon as she was alone, and watch\ntill I departed, your conscience quite calm: you would be hindering\nmischief.'\n\nI protested against playing that treacherous part in my employer's house:\nand, besides, I urged the cruelty and selfishness of his destroying Mrs.\nLinton's tranquillity for his satisfaction.  'The commonest occurrence\nstartles her painfully,' I said.  'She's all nerves, and she couldn't\nbear the surprise, I'm positive.  Don't persist, sir! or else I shall be\nobliged to inform my master of your designs; and he'll take measures to\nsecure his house and its inmates from any such unwarrantable intrusions!'\n\n'In that case I'll take measures to secure you, woman!' exclaimed\nHeathcliff; 'you shall not leave Wuthering Heights till to-morrow\nmorning.  It is a foolish story to assert that Catherine could not bear\nto see me; and as to surprising her, I don't desire it: you must prepare\nher--ask her if I may come.  You say she never mentions my name, and that\nI am never mentioned to her.  To whom should she mention me if I am a\nforbidden topic in the house?  She thinks you are all spies for her\nhusband.  Oh, I've no doubt she's in hell among you!  I guess by her\nsilence, as much as anything, what she feels.  You say she is often\nrestless, and anxious-looking: is that a proof of tranquillity?  You talk\nof her mind being unsettled.  How the devil could it be otherwise in her\nfrightful isolation?  And that insipid, paltry creature attending her\nfrom _duty_ and _humanity_!  From _pity_ and _charity_!  He might as well\nplant an oak in a flower-pot, and expect it to thrive, as imagine he can\nrestore her to vigour in the soil of his shallow cares?  Let us settle it\nat once: will you stay here, and am I to fight my way to Catherine over\nLinton and his footman?  Or will you be my friend, as you have been\nhitherto, and do what I request?  Decide! because there is no reason for\nmy lingering another minute, if you persist in your stubborn ill-nature!'\n\nWell, Mr. Lockwood, I argued and complained, and flatly refused him fifty\ntimes; but in the long run he forced me to an agreement.  I engaged to\ncarry a letter from him to my mistress; and should she consent, I\npromised to let him have intelligence of Linton's next absence from home,\nwhen he might come, and get in as he was able: I wouldn't be there, and\nmy fellow-servants should be equally out of the way.  Was it right or\nwrong?  I fear it was wrong, though expedient.  I thought I prevented\nanother explosion by my compliance; and I thought, too, it might create a\nfavourable crisis in Catherine's mental illness: and then I remembered\nMr. Edgar's stern rebuke of my carrying tales; and I tried to smooth away\nall disquietude on the subject, by affirming, with frequent iteration,\nthat that betrayal of trust, if it merited so harsh an appellation,\nshould be the last.  Notwithstanding, my journey homeward was sadder than\nmy journey thither; and many misgivings I had, ere I could prevail on\nmyself to put the missive into Mrs. Linton's hand.\n\nBut here is Kenneth; I'll go down, and tell him how much better you are.\nMy history is _dree_, as we say, and will serve to while away another\nmorning.\n\nDree, and dreary!  I reflected as the good woman descended to receive the\ndoctor: and not exactly of the kind which I should have chosen to amuse\nme.  But never mind!  I'll extract wholesome medicines from Mrs. Dean's\nbitter herbs; and firstly, let me beware of the fascination that lurks in\nCatherine Heathcliff's brilliant eyes.  I should be in a curious taking\nif I surrendered my heart to that young person, and the daughter turned\nout a second edition of the mother.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XV\n\n\nAnother week over--and I am so many days nearer health, and spring!  I\nhave now heard all my neighbour's history, at different sittings, as the\nhousekeeper could spare time from more important occupations.  I'll\ncontinue it in her own words, only a little condensed.  She is, on the\nwhole, a very fair narrator, and I don't think I could improve her style.\n\nIn the evening, she said, the evening of my visit to the Heights, I knew,\nas well as if I saw him, that Mr. Heathcliff was about the place; and I\nshunned going out, because I still carried his letter in my pocket, and\ndidn't want to be threatened or teased any more.  I had made up my mind\nnot to give it till my master went somewhere, as I could not guess how\nits receipt would affect Catherine.  The consequence was, that it did not\nreach her before the lapse of three days.  The fourth was Sunday, and I\nbrought it into her room after the family were gone to church.  There was\na manservant left to keep the house with me, and we generally made a\npractice of locking the doors during the hours of service; but on that\noccasion the weather was so warm and pleasant that I set them wide open,\nand, to fulfil my engagement, as I knew who would be coming, I told my\ncompanion that the mistress wished very much for some oranges, and he\nmust run over to the village and get a few, to be paid for on the morrow.\nHe departed, and I went up-stairs.\n\nMrs. Linton sat in a loose white dress, with a light shawl over her\nshoulders, in the recess of the open window, as usual.  Her thick, long\nhair had been partly removed at the beginning of her illness, and now she\nwore it simply combed in its natural tresses over her temples and neck.\nHer appearance was altered, as I had told Heathcliff; but when she was\ncalm, there seemed unearthly beauty in the change.  The flash of her eyes\nhad been succeeded by a dreamy and melancholy softness; they no longer\ngave the impression of looking at the objects around her: they appeared\nalways to gaze beyond, and far beyond--you would have said out of this\nworld.  Then, the paleness of her face--its haggard aspect having\nvanished as she recovered flesh--and the peculiar expression arising from\nher mental state, though painfully suggestive of their causes, added to\nthe touching interest which she awakened; and--invariably to me, I know,\nand to any person who saw her, I should think--refuted more tangible\nproofs of convalescence, and stamped her as one doomed to decay.\n\nA book lay spread on the sill before her, and the scarcely perceptible\nwind fluttered its leaves at intervals.  I believe Linton had laid it\nthere: for she never endeavoured to divert herself with reading, or\noccupation of any kind, and he would spend many an hour in trying to\nentice her attention to some subject which had formerly been her\namusement.  She was conscious of his aim, and in her better moods endured\nhis efforts placidly, only showing their uselessness by now and then\nsuppressing a wearied sigh, and checking him at last with the saddest of\nsmiles and kisses.  At other times, she would turn petulantly away, and\nhide her face in her hands, or even push him off angrily; and then he\ntook care to let her alone, for he was certain of doing no good.\n\nGimmerton chapel bells were still ringing; and the full, mellow flow of\nthe beck in the valley came soothingly on the ear.  It was a sweet\nsubstitute for the yet absent murmur of the summer foliage, which drowned\nthat music about the Grange when the trees were in leaf.  At Wuthering\nHeights it always sounded on quiet days following a great thaw or a\nseason of steady rain.  And of Wuthering Heights Catherine was thinking\nas she listened: that is, if she thought or listened at all; but she had\nthe vague, distant look I mentioned before, which expressed no\nrecognition of material things either by ear or eye.\n\n'There's a letter for you, Mrs. Linton,' I said, gently inserting it in\none hand that rested on her knee.  'You must read it immediately, because\nit wants an answer.  Shall I break the seal?'  'Yes,' she answered,\nwithout altering the direction of her eyes.  I opened it--it was very\nshort.  'Now,' I continued, 'read it.'  She drew away her hand, and let\nit fall.  I replaced it in her lap, and stood waiting till it should\nplease her to glance down; but that movement was so long delayed that at\nlast I resumed--'Must I read it, ma'am?  It is from Mr. Heathcliff.'\n\nThere was a start and a troubled gleam of recollection, and a struggle to\narrange her ideas.  She lifted the letter, and seemed to peruse it; and\nwhen she came to the signature she sighed: yet still I found she had not\ngathered its import, for, upon my desiring to hear her reply, she merely\npointed to the name, and gazed at me with mournful and questioning\neagerness.\n\n'Well, he wishes to see you,' said I, guessing her need of an\ninterpreter.  'He's in the garden by this time, and impatient to know\nwhat answer I shall bring.'\n\nAs I spoke, I observed a large dog lying on the sunny grass beneath raise\nits ears as if about to bark, and then smoothing them back, announce, by\na wag of the tail, that some one approached whom it did not consider a\nstranger.  Mrs. Linton bent forward, and listened breathlessly.  The\nminute after a step traversed the hall; the open house was too tempting\nfor Heathcliff to resist walking in: most likely he supposed that I was\ninclined to shirk my promise, and so resolved to trust to his own\naudacity.  With straining eagerness Catherine gazed towards the entrance\nof her chamber.  He did not hit the right room directly: she motioned me\nto admit him, but he found it out ere I could reach the door, and in a\nstride or two was at her side, and had her grasped in his arms.\n\nHe neither spoke nor loosed his hold for some five minutes, during which\nperiod he bestowed more kisses than ever he gave in his life before, I\ndaresay: but then my mistress had kissed him first, and I plainly saw\nthat he could hardly bear, for downright agony, to look into her face!\nThe same conviction had stricken him as me, from the instant he beheld\nher, that there was no prospect of ultimate recovery there--she was\nfated, sure to die.\n\n'Oh, Cathy!  Oh, my life! how can I bear it?' was the first sentence he\nuttered, in a tone that did not seek to disguise his despair.  And now he\nstared at her so earnestly that I thought the very intensity of his gaze\nwould bring tears into his eyes; but they burned with anguish: they did\nnot melt.\n\n'What now?' said Catherine, leaning back, and returning his look with a\nsuddenly clouded brow: her humour was a mere vane for constantly varying\ncaprices.  'You and Edgar have broken my heart, Heathcliff!  And you both\ncome to bewail the deed to me, as if you were the people to be pitied!  I\nshall not pity you, not I.  You have killed me--and thriven on it, I\nthink.  How strong you are!  How many years do you mean to live after I\nam gone?'\n\nHeathcliff had knelt on one knee to embrace her; he attempted to rise,\nbut she seized his hair, and kept him down.\n\n'I wish I could hold you,' she continued, bitterly, 'till we were both\ndead!  I shouldn't care what you suffered.  I care nothing for your\nsufferings.  Why shouldn't you suffer?  I do!  Will you forget me?  Will\nyou be happy when I am in the earth?  Will you say twenty years hence,\n\"That's the grave of Catherine Earnshaw?  I loved her long ago, and was\nwretched to lose her; but it is past.  I've loved many others since: my\nchildren are dearer to me than she was; and, at death, I shall not\nrejoice that I am going to her: I shall be sorry that I must leave\nthem!\"  Will you say so, Heathcliff?'\n\n'Don't torture me till I'm as mad as yourself,' cried he, wrenching his\nhead free, and grinding his teeth.\n\nThe two, to a cool spectator, made a strange and fearful picture.  Well\nmight Catherine deem that heaven would be a land of exile to her, unless\nwith her mortal body she cast away her moral character also.  Her present\ncountenance had a wild vindictiveness in its white cheek, and a bloodless\nlip and scintillating eye; and she retained in her closed fingers a\nportion of the locks she had been grasping.  As to her companion, while\nraising himself with one hand, he had taken her arm with the other; and\nso inadequate was his stock of gentleness to the requirements of her\ncondition, that on his letting go I saw four distinct impressions left\nblue in the colourless skin.\n\n'Are you possessed with a devil,' he pursued, savagely, 'to talk in that\nmanner to me when you are dying?  Do you reflect that all those words\nwill be branded in my memory, and eating deeper eternally after you have\nleft me?  You know you lie to say I have killed you: and, Catherine, you\nknow that I could as soon forget you as my existence!  Is it not\nsufficient for your infernal selfishness, that while you are at peace I\nshall writhe in the torments of hell?'\n\n'I shall not be at peace,' moaned Catherine, recalled to a sense of\nphysical weakness by the violent, unequal throbbing of her heart, which\nbeat visibly and audibly under this excess of agitation.  She said\nnothing further till the paroxysm was over; then she continued, more\nkindly--\n\n'I'm not wishing you greater torment than I have, Heathcliff.  I only\nwish us never to be parted: and should a word of mine distress you\nhereafter, think I feel the same distress underground, and for my own\nsake, forgive me!  Come here and kneel down again!  You never harmed me\nin your life.  Nay, if you nurse anger, that will be worse to remember\nthan my harsh words!  Won't you come here again?  Do!'\n\nHeathcliff went to the back of her chair, and leant over, but not so far\nas to let her see his face, which was livid with emotion.  She bent round\nto look at him; he would not permit it: turning abruptly, he walked to\nthe fireplace, where he stood, silent, with his back towards us.  Mrs.\nLinton's glance followed him suspiciously: every movement woke a new\nsentiment in her.  After a pause and a prolonged gaze, she resumed;\naddressing me in accents of indignant disappointment:--\n\n'Oh, you see, Nelly, he would not relent a moment to keep me out of the\ngrave.  _That_ is how I'm loved!  Well, never mind.  That is not _my_\nHeathcliff.  I shall love mine yet; and take him with me: he's in my\nsoul.  And,' added she musingly, 'the thing that irks me most is this\nshattered prison, after all.  I'm tired of being enclosed here.  I'm\nwearying to escape into that glorious world, and to be always there: not\nseeing it dimly through tears, and yearning for it through the walls of\nan aching heart: but really with it, and in it.  Nelly, you think you are\nbetter and more fortunate than I; in full health and strength: you are\nsorry for me--very soon that will be altered.  I shall be sorry for\n_you_.  I shall be incomparably beyond and above you all.  I _wonder_ he\nwon't be near me!'  She went on to herself.  'I thought he wished it.\nHeathcliff, dear! you should not be sullen now.  Do come to me,\nHeathcliff.'\n\nIn her eagerness she rose and supported herself on the arm of the chair.\nAt that earnest appeal he turned to her, looking absolutely desperate.\nHis eyes, wide and wet, at last flashed fiercely on her; his breast\nheaved convulsively.  An instant they held asunder, and then how they met\nI hardly saw, but Catherine made a spring, and he caught her, and they\nwere locked in an embrace from which I thought my mistress would never be\nreleased alive: in fact, to my eyes, she seemed directly insensible.  He\nflung himself into the nearest seat, and on my approaching hurriedly to\nascertain if she had fainted, he gnashed at me, and foamed like a mad\ndog, and gathered her to him with greedy jealousy.  I did not feel as if\nI were in the company of a creature of my own species: it appeared that\nhe would not understand, though I spoke to him; so I stood off, and held\nmy tongue, in great perplexity.\n\nA movement of Catherine's relieved me a little presently: she put up her\nhand to clasp his neck, and bring her cheek to his as he held her; while\nhe, in return, covering her with frantic caresses, said wildly--\n\n'You teach me now how cruel you've been--cruel and false.  _Why_ did you\ndespise me?  _Why_ did you betray your own heart, Cathy?  I have not one\nword of comfort.  You deserve this.  You have killed yourself.  Yes, you\nmay kiss me, and cry; and wring out my kisses and tears: they'll blight\nyou--they'll damn you.  You loved me--then what _right_ had you to leave\nme?  What right--answer me--for the poor fancy you felt for Linton?\nBecause misery and degradation, and death, and nothing that God or Satan\ncould inflict would have parted us, _you_, of your own will, did it.  I\nhave not broken your heart--_you_ have broken it; and in breaking it, you\nhave broken mine.  So much the worse for me that I am strong.  Do I want\nto live?  What kind of living will it be when you--oh, God! would _you_\nlike to live with your soul in the grave?'\n\n'Let me alone.  Let me alone,' sobbed Catherine.  'If I've done wrong,\nI'm dying for it.  It is enough!  You left me too: but I won't upbraid\nyou!  I forgive you.  Forgive me!'\n\n'It is hard to forgive, and to look at those eyes, and feel those wasted\nhands,' he answered.  'Kiss me again; and don't let me see your eyes!  I\nforgive what you have done to me.  I love _my_ murderer--but _yours_!  How\ncan I?'\n\nThey were silent--their faces hid against each other, and washed by each\nother's tears.  At least, I suppose the weeping was on both sides; as it\nseemed Heathcliff could weep on a great occasion like this.\n\nI grew very uncomfortable, meanwhile; for the afternoon wore fast away,\nthe man whom I had sent off returned from his errand, and I could\ndistinguish, by the shine of the western sun up the valley, a concourse\nthickening outside Gimmerton chapel porch.\n\n'Service is over,' I announced.  'My master will be here in half an\nhour.'\n\nHeathcliff groaned a curse, and strained Catherine closer: she never\nmoved.\n\nEre long I perceived a group of the servants passing up the road towards\nthe kitchen wing.  Mr. Linton was not far behind; he opened the gate\nhimself and sauntered slowly up, probably enjoying the lovely afternoon\nthat breathed as soft as summer.\n\n'Now he is here,' I exclaimed.  'For heaven's sake, hurry down!  You'll\nnot meet any one on the front stairs.  Do be quick; and stay among the\ntrees till he is fairly in.'\n\n'I must go, Cathy,' said Heathcliff, seeking to extricate himself from\nhis companion's arms.  'But if I live, I'll see you again before you are\nasleep.  I won't stray five yards from your window.'\n\n'You must not go!' she answered, holding him as firmly as her strength\nallowed.  'You _shall_ not, I tell you.'\n\n'For one hour,' he pleaded earnestly.\n\n'Not for one minute,' she replied.\n\n'I _must_--Linton will be up immediately,' persisted the alarmed\nintruder.\n\nHe would have risen, and unfixed her fingers by the act--she clung fast,\ngasping: there was mad resolution in her face.\n\n'No!' she shrieked.  'Oh, don't, don't go.  It is the last time!  Edgar\nwill not hurt us.  Heathcliff, I shall die!  I shall die!'\n\n'Damn the fool!  There he is,' cried Heathcliff, sinking back into his\nseat.  'Hush, my darling!  Hush, hush, Catherine!  I'll stay.  If he shot\nme so, I'd expire with a blessing on my lips.'\n\nAnd there they were fast again.  I heard my master mounting the\nstairs--the cold sweat ran from my forehead: I was horrified.\n\n'Are you going to listen to her ravings?' I said, passionately.  'She\ndoes not know what she says.  Will you ruin her, because she has not wit\nto help herself?  Get up!  You could be free instantly.  That is the most\ndiabolical deed that ever you did.  We are all done for--master,\nmistress, and servant.'\n\nI wrung my hands, and cried out; and Mr. Linton hastened his step at the\nnoise.  In the midst of my agitation, I was sincerely glad to observe\nthat Catherine's arms had fallen relaxed, and her head hung down.\n\n'She's fainted, or dead,' I thought: 'so much the better.  Far better\nthat she should be dead, than lingering a burden and a misery-maker to\nall about her.'\n\nEdgar sprang to his unbidden guest, blanched with astonishment and rage.\nWhat he meant to do I cannot tell; however, the other stopped all\ndemonstrations, at once, by placing the lifeless-looking form in his\narms.\n\n'Look there!' he said.  'Unless you be a fiend, help her first--then you\nshall speak to me!'\n\nHe walked into the parlour, and sat down.  Mr. Linton summoned me, and\nwith great difficulty, and after resorting to many means, we managed to\nrestore her to sensation; but she was all bewildered; she sighed, and\nmoaned, and knew nobody.  Edgar, in his anxiety for her, forgot her hated\nfriend.  I did not.  I went, at the earliest opportunity, and besought\nhim to depart; affirming that Catherine was better, and he should hear\nfrom me in the morning how she passed the night.\n\n'I shall not refuse to go out of doors,' he answered; 'but I shall stay\nin the garden: and, Nelly, mind you keep your word to-morrow.  I shall be\nunder those larch-trees.  Mind! or I pay another visit, whether Linton be\nin or not.'\n\nHe sent a rapid glance through the half-open door of the chamber, and,\nascertaining that what I stated was apparently true, delivered the house\nof his luckless presence.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI\n\n\nAbout twelve o'clock that night was born the Catherine you saw at\nWuthering Heights: a puny, seven-months' child; and two hours after the\nmother died, having never recovered sufficient consciousness to miss\nHeathcliff, or know Edgar.  The latter's distraction at his bereavement\nis a subject too painful to be dwelt on; its after-effects showed how\ndeep the sorrow sunk.  A great addition, in my eyes, was his being left\nwithout an heir.  I bemoaned that, as I gazed on the feeble orphan; and I\nmentally abused old Linton for (what was only natural partiality) the\nsecuring his estate to his own daughter, instead of his son's.  An\nunwelcomed infant it was, poor thing!  It might have wailed out of life,\nand nobody cared a morsel, during those first hours of existence.  We\nredeemed the neglect afterwards; but its beginning was as friendless as\nits end is likely to be.\n\nNext morning--bright and cheerful out of doors--stole softened in through\nthe blinds of the silent room, and suffused the couch and its occupant\nwith a mellow, tender glow.  Edgar Linton had his head laid on the\npillow, and his eyes shut.  His young and fair features were almost as\ndeathlike as those of the form beside him, and almost as fixed: but _his_\nwas the hush of exhausted anguish, and _hers_ of perfect peace.  Her brow\nsmooth, her lids closed, her lips wearing the expression of a smile; no\nangel in heaven could be more beautiful than she appeared.  And I partook\nof the infinite calm in which she lay: my mind was never in a holier\nframe than while I gazed on that untroubled image of Divine rest.  I\ninstinctively echoed the words she had uttered a few hours before:\n'Incomparably beyond and above us all!  Whether still on earth or now in\nheaven, her spirit is at home with God!'\n\nI don't know if it be a peculiarity in me, but I am seldom otherwise than\nhappy while watching in the chamber of death, should no frenzied or\ndespairing mourner share the duty with me.  I see a repose that neither\nearth nor hell can break, and I feel an assurance of the endless and\nshadowless hereafter--the Eternity they have entered--where life is\nboundless in its duration, and love in its sympathy, and joy in its\nfulness.  I noticed on that occasion how much selfishness there is even\nin a love like Mr. Linton's, when he so regretted Catherine's blessed\nrelease!  To be sure, one might have doubted, after the wayward and\nimpatient existence she had led, whether she merited a haven of peace at\nlast.  One might doubt in seasons of cold reflection; but not then, in\nthe presence of her corpse.  It asserted its own tranquillity, which\nseemed a pledge of equal quiet to its former inhabitant.\n\nDo you believe such people are happy in the other world, sir?  I'd give a\ngreat deal to know.\n\nI declined answering Mrs. Dean's question, which struck me as something\nheterodox.  She proceeded:\n\nRetracing the course of Catherine Linton, I fear we have no right to\nthink she is; but we'll leave her with her Maker.\n\nThe master looked asleep, and I ventured soon after sunrise to quit the\nroom and steal out to the pure refreshing air.  The servants thought me\ngone to shake off the drowsiness of my protracted watch; in reality, my\nchief motive was seeing Mr. Heathcliff.  If he had remained among the\nlarches all night, he would have heard nothing of the stir at the Grange;\nunless, perhaps, he might catch the gallop of the messenger going to\nGimmerton.  If he had come nearer, he would probably be aware, from the\nlights flitting to and fro, and the opening and shutting of the outer\ndoors, that all was not right within.  I wished, yet feared, to find him.\nI felt the terrible news must be told, and I longed to get it over; but\nhow to do it I did not know.  He was there--at least, a few yards further\nin the park; leant against an old ash-tree, his hat off, and his hair\nsoaked with the dew that had gathered on the budded branches, and fell\npattering round him.  He had been standing a long time in that position,\nfor I saw a pair of ousels passing and repassing scarcely three feet from\nhim, busy in building their nest, and regarding his proximity no more\nthan that of a piece of timber.  They flew off at my approach, and he\nraised his eyes and spoke:--'She's dead!' he said; 'I've not waited for\nyou to learn that.  Put your handkerchief away--don't snivel before me.\nDamn you all! she wants none of your tears!'\n\nI was weeping as much for him as her: we do sometimes pity creatures that\nhave none of the feeling either for themselves or others.  When I first\nlooked into his face, I perceived that he had got intelligence of the\ncatastrophe; and a foolish notion struck me that his heart was quelled\nand he prayed, because his lips moved and his gaze was bent on the\nground.\n\n'Yes, she's dead!' I answered, checking my sobs and drying my cheeks.\n'Gone to heaven, I hope; where we may, every one, join her, if we take\ndue warning and leave our evil ways to follow good!'\n\n'Did _she_ take due warning, then?' asked Heathcliff, attempting a sneer.\n'Did she die like a saint?  Come, give me a true history of the event.\nHow did--?'\n\nHe endeavoured to pronounce the name, but could not manage it; and\ncompressing his mouth he held a silent combat with his inward agony,\ndefying, meanwhile, my sympathy with an unflinching, ferocious stare.\n'How did she die?' he resumed, at last--fain, notwithstanding his\nhardihood, to have a support behind him; for, after the struggle, he\ntrembled, in spite of himself, to his very finger-ends.\n\n'Poor wretch!' I thought; 'you have a heart and nerves the same as your\nbrother men!  Why should you be anxious to conceal them?  Your pride\ncannot blind God!  You tempt him to wring them, till he forces a cry of\nhumiliation.'\n\n'Quietly as a lamb!' I answered, aloud.  'She drew a sigh, and stretched\nherself, like a child reviving, and sinking again to sleep; and five\nminutes after I felt one little pulse at her heart, and nothing more!'\n\n'And--did she ever mention me?' he asked, hesitating, as if he dreaded\nthe answer to his question would introduce details that he could not bear\nto hear.\n\n'Her senses never returned: she recognised nobody from the time you left\nher,' I said.  'She lies with a sweet smile on her face; and her latest\nideas wandered back to pleasant early days.  Her life closed in a gentle\ndream--may she wake as kindly in the other world!'\n\n'May she wake in torment!' he cried, with frightful vehemence, stamping\nhis foot, and groaning in a sudden paroxysm of ungovernable passion.\n'Why, she's a liar to the end!  Where is she?  Not _there_--not in\nheaven--not perished--where?  Oh! you said you cared nothing for my\nsufferings!  And I pray one prayer--I repeat it till my tongue\nstiffens--Catherine Earnshaw, may you not rest as long as I am living;\nyou said I killed you--haunt me, then!  The murdered _do_ haunt their\nmurderers, I believe.  I know that ghosts _have_ wandered on earth.  Be\nwith me always--take any form--drive me mad! only _do_ not leave me in\nthis abyss, where I cannot find you!  Oh, God! it is unutterable!  I\n_cannot_ live without my life!  I _cannot_ live without my soul!'\n\nHe dashed his head against the knotted trunk; and, lifting up his eyes,\nhowled, not like a man, but like a savage beast being goaded to death\nwith knives and spears.  I observed several splashes of blood about the\nbark of the tree, and his hand and forehead were both stained; probably\nthe scene I witnessed was a repetition of others acted during the night.\nIt hardly moved my compassion--it appalled me: still, I felt reluctant to\nquit him so.  But the moment he recollected himself enough to notice me\nwatching, he thundered a command for me to go, and I obeyed.  He was\nbeyond my skill to quiet or console!\n\nMrs. Linton's funeral was appointed to take place on the Friday following\nher decease; and till then her coffin remained uncovered, and strewn with\nflowers and scented leaves, in the great drawing-room.  Linton spent his\ndays and nights there, a sleepless guardian; and--a circumstance\nconcealed from all but me--Heathcliff spent his nights, at least,\noutside, equally a stranger to repose.  I held no communication with him:\nstill, I was conscious of his design to enter, if he could; and on the\nTuesday, a little after dark, when my master, from sheer fatigue, had\nbeen compelled to retire a couple of hours, I went and opened one of the\nwindows; moved by his perseverance to give him a chance of bestowing on\nthe faded image of his idol one final adieu.  He did not omit to avail\nhimself of the opportunity, cautiously and briefly; too cautiously to\nbetray his presence by the slightest noise.  Indeed, I shouldn't have\ndiscovered that he had been there, except for the disarrangement of the\ndrapery about the corpse's face, and for observing on the floor a curl of\nlight hair, fastened with a silver thread; which, on examination, I\nascertained to have been taken from a locket hung round Catherine's neck.\nHeathcliff had opened the trinket and cast out its contents, replacing\nthem by a black lock of his own.  I twisted the two, and enclosed them\ntogether.\n\nMr. Earnshaw was, of course, invited to attend the remains of his sister\nto the grave; he sent no excuse, but he never came; so that, besides her\nhusband, the mourners were wholly composed of tenants and servants.\nIsabella was not asked.\n\nThe place of Catherine's interment, to the surprise of the villagers, was\nneither in the chapel under the carved monument of the Lintons, nor yet\nby the tombs of her own relations, outside.  It was dug on a green slope\nin a corner of the kirk-yard, where the wall is so low that heath and\nbilberry-plants have climbed over it from the moor; and peat-mould almost\nburies it.  Her husband lies in the same spot now; and they have each a\nsimple headstone above, and a plain grey block at their feet, to mark the\ngraves.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVII\n\n\nThat Friday made the last of our fine days for a month.  In the evening\nthe weather broke: the wind shifted from south to north-east, and brought\nrain first, and then sleet and snow.  On the morrow one could hardly\nimagine that there had been three weeks of summer: the primroses and\ncrocuses were hidden under wintry drifts; the larks were silent, the\nyoung leaves of the early trees smitten and blackened.  And dreary, and\nchill, and dismal, that morrow did creep over!  My master kept his room;\nI took possession of the lonely parlour, converting it into a nursery:\nand there I was, sitting with the moaning doll of a child laid on my\nknee; rocking it to and fro, and watching, meanwhile, the still driving\nflakes build up the uncurtained window, when the door opened, and some\nperson entered, out of breath and laughing!  My anger was greater than my\nastonishment for a minute.  I supposed it one of the maids, and I\ncried--'Have done!  How dare you show your giddiness here; What would Mr.\nLinton say if he heard you?'\n\n'Excuse me!' answered a familiar voice; 'but I know Edgar is in bed, and\nI cannot stop myself.'\n\nWith that the speaker came forward to the fire, panting and holding her\nhand to her side.\n\n'I have run the whole way from Wuthering Heights!' she continued, after a\npause; 'except where I've flown.  I couldn't count the number of falls\nI've had.  Oh, I'm aching all over!  Don't be alarmed!  There shall be an\nexplanation as soon as I can give it; only just have the goodness to step\nout and order the carriage to take me on to Gimmerton, and tell a servant\nto seek up a few clothes in my wardrobe.'\n\nThe intruder was Mrs. Heathcliff.  She certainly seemed in no laughing\npredicament: her hair streamed on her shoulders, dripping with snow and\nwater; she was dressed in the girlish dress she commonly wore, befitting\nher age more than her position: a low frock with short sleeves, and\nnothing on either head or neck.  The frock was of light silk, and clung\nto her with wet, and her feet were protected merely by thin slippers; add\nto this a deep cut under one ear, which only the cold prevented from\nbleeding profusely, a white face scratched and bruised, and a frame\nhardly able to support itself through fatigue; and you may fancy my first\nfright was not much allayed when I had had leisure to examine her.\n\n'My dear young lady,' I exclaimed, 'I'll stir nowhere, and hear nothing,\ntill you have removed every article of your clothes, and put on dry\nthings; and certainly you shall not go to Gimmerton to-night, so it is\nneedless to order the carriage.'\n\n'Certainly I shall,' she said; 'walking or riding: yet I've no objection\nto dress myself decently.  And--ah, see how it flows down my neck now!\nThe fire does make it smart.'\n\nShe insisted on my fulfilling her directions, before she would let me\ntouch her; and not till after the coachman had been instructed to get\nready, and a maid set to pack up some necessary attire, did I obtain her\nconsent for binding the wound and helping to change her garments.\n\n'Now, Ellen,' she said, when my task was finished and she was seated in\nan easy-chair on the hearth, with a cup of tea before her, 'you sit down\nopposite me, and put poor Catherine's baby away: I don't like to see it!\nYou mustn't think I care little for Catherine, because I behaved so\nfoolishly on entering: I've cried, too, bitterly--yes, more than any one\nelse has reason to cry.  We parted unreconciled, you remember, and I\nsha'n't forgive myself.  But, for all that, I was not going to sympathise\nwith him--the brute beast!  Oh, give me the poker!  This is the last\nthing of his I have about me:' she slipped the gold ring from her third\nfinger, and threw it on the floor.  'I'll smash it!' she continued,\nstriking it with childish spite, 'and then I'll burn it!' and she took\nand dropped the misused article among the coals.  'There! he shall buy\nanother, if he gets me back again.  He'd be capable of coming to seek me,\nto tease Edgar.  I dare not stay, lest that notion should possess his\nwicked head!  And besides, Edgar has not been kind, has he?  And I won't\ncome suing for his assistance; nor will I bring him into more trouble.\nNecessity compelled me to seek shelter here; though, if I had not learned\nhe was out of the way, I'd have halted at the kitchen, washed my face,\nwarmed myself, got you to bring what I wanted, and departed again to\nanywhere out of the reach of my accursed--of that incarnate goblin!  Ah,\nhe was in such a fury!  If he had caught me!  It's a pity Earnshaw is not\nhis match in strength: I wouldn't have run till I'd seen him all but\ndemolished, had Hindley been able to do it!'\n\n'Well, don't talk so fast, Miss!' I interrupted; 'you'll disorder the\nhandkerchief I have tied round your face, and make the cut bleed again.\nDrink your tea, and take breath, and give over laughing: laughter is\nsadly out of place under this roof, and in your condition!'\n\n'An undeniable truth,' she replied.  'Listen to that child!  It maintains\na constant wail--send it out of my hearing for an hour; I sha'n't stay\nany longer.'\n\nI rang the bell, and committed it to a servant's care; and then I\ninquired what had urged her to escape from Wuthering Heights in such an\nunlikely plight, and where she meant to go, as she refused remaining with\nus.\n\n'I ought, and I wished to remain,' answered she, 'to cheer Edgar and take\ncare of the baby, for two things, and because the Grange is my right\nhome.  But I tell you he wouldn't let me!  Do you think he could bear to\nsee me grow fat and merry--could bear to think that we were tranquil, and\nnot resolve on poisoning our comfort?  Now, I have the satisfaction of\nbeing sure that he detests me, to the point of its annoying him seriously\nto have me within ear-shot or eyesight: I notice, when I enter his\npresence, the muscles of his countenance are involuntarily distorted into\nan expression of hatred; partly arising from his knowledge of the good\ncauses I have to feel that sentiment for him, and partly from original\naversion.  It is strong enough to make me feel pretty certain that he\nwould not chase me over England, supposing I contrived a clear escape;\nand therefore I must get quite away.  I've recovered from my first desire\nto be killed by him: I'd rather he'd kill himself!  He has extinguished\nmy love effectually, and so I'm at my ease.  I can recollect yet how I\nloved him; and can dimly imagine that I could still be loving him, if--no,\nno!  Even if he had doted on me, the devilish nature would have revealed\nits existence somehow.  Catherine had an awfully perverted taste to\nesteem him so dearly, knowing him so well.  Monster! would that he could\nbe blotted out of creation, and out of my memory!'\n\n'Hush, hush!  He's a human being,' I said.  'Be more charitable: there\nare worse men than he is yet!'\n\n'He's not a human being,' she retorted; 'and he has no claim on my\ncharity.  I gave him my heart, and he took and pinched it to death, and\nflung it back to me.  People feel with their hearts, Ellen: and since he\nhas destroyed mine, I have not power to feel for him: and I would not,\nthough he groaned from this to his dying day, and wept tears of blood for\nCatherine!  No, indeed, indeed, I wouldn't!'  And here Isabella began to\ncry; but, immediately dashing the water from her lashes, she recommenced.\n'You asked, what has driven me to flight at last?  I was compelled to\nattempt it, because I had succeeded in rousing his rage a pitch above his\nmalignity.  Pulling out the nerves with red hot pincers requires more\ncoolness than knocking on the head.  He was worked up to forget the\nfiendish prudence he boasted of, and proceeded to murderous violence.  I\nexperienced pleasure in being able to exasperate him: the sense of\npleasure woke my instinct of self-preservation, so I fairly broke free;\nand if ever I come into his hands again he is welcome to a signal\nrevenge.\n\n'Yesterday, you know, Mr. Earnshaw should have been at the funeral.  He\nkept himself sober for the purpose--tolerably sober: not going to bed mad\nat six o'clock and getting up drunk at twelve.  Consequently, he rose, in\nsuicidal low spirits, as fit for the church as for a dance; and instead,\nhe sat down by the fire and swallowed gin or brandy by tumblerfuls.\n\n'Heathcliff--I shudder to name him! has been a stranger in the house from\nlast Sunday till to-day.  Whether the angels have fed him, or his kin\nbeneath, I cannot tell; but he has not eaten a meal with us for nearly a\nweek.  He has just come home at dawn, and gone up-stairs to his chamber;\nlocking himself in--as if anybody dreamt of coveting his company!  There\nhe has continued, praying like a Methodist: only the deity he implored is\nsenseless dust and ashes; and God, when addressed, was curiously\nconfounded with his own black father!  After concluding these precious\norisons--and they lasted generally till he grew hoarse and his voice was\nstrangled in his throat--he would be off again; always straight down to\nthe Grange!  I wonder Edgar did not send for a constable, and give him\ninto custody!  For me, grieved as I was about Catherine, it was\nimpossible to avoid regarding this season of deliverance from degrading\noppression as a holiday.\n\n'I recovered spirits sufficient to bear Joseph's eternal lectures without\nweeping, and to move up and down the house less with the foot of a\nfrightened thief than formerly.  You wouldn't think that I should cry at\nanything Joseph could say; but he and Hareton are detestable companions.\nI'd rather sit with Hindley, and hear his awful talk, than with \"t'\nlittle maister\" and his staunch supporter, that odious old man!  When\nHeathcliff is in, I'm often obliged to seek the kitchen and their\nsociety, or starve among the damp uninhabited chambers; when he is not,\nas was the case this week, I establish a table and chair at one corner of\nthe house fire, and never mind how Mr. Earnshaw may occupy himself; and\nhe does not interfere with my arrangements.  He is quieter now than he\nused to be, if no one provokes him: more sullen and depressed, and less\nfurious.  Joseph affirms he's sure he's an altered man: that the Lord has\ntouched his heart, and he is saved \"so as by fire.\"  I'm puzzled to\ndetect signs of the favourable change: but it is not my business.\n\n'Yester-evening I sat in my nook reading some old books till late on\ntowards twelve.  It seemed so dismal to go up-stairs, with the wild snow\nblowing outside, and my thoughts continually reverting to the kirk-yard\nand the new-made grave!  I dared hardly lift my eyes from the page before\nme, that melancholy scene so instantly usurped its place.  Hindley sat\nopposite, his head leant on his hand; perhaps meditating on the same\nsubject.  He had ceased drinking at a point below irrationality, and had\nneither stirred nor spoken during two or three hours.  There was no sound\nthrough the house but the moaning wind, which shook the windows every now\nand then, the faint crackling of the coals, and the click of my snuffers\nas I removed at intervals the long wick of the candle.  Hareton and\nJoseph were probably fast asleep in bed.  It was very, very sad: and\nwhile I read I sighed, for it seemed as if all joy had vanished from the\nworld, never to be restored.\n\n'The doleful silence was broken at length by the sound of the kitchen\nlatch: Heathcliff had returned from his watch earlier than usual; owing,\nI suppose, to the sudden storm.  That entrance was fastened, and we heard\nhim coming round to get in by the other.  I rose with an irrepressible\nexpression of what I felt on my lips, which induced my companion, who had\nbeen staring towards the door, to turn and look at me.\n\n'\"I'll keep him out five minutes,\" he exclaimed.  \"You won't object?\"\n\n'\"No, you may keep him out the whole night for me,\" I answered.  \"Do! put\nthe key in the lock, and draw the bolts.\"\n\n'Earnshaw accomplished this ere his guest reached the front; he then came\nand brought his chair to the other side of my table, leaning over it, and\nsearching in my eyes for a sympathy with the burning hate that gleamed\nfrom his: as he both looked and felt like an assassin, he couldn't\nexactly find that; but he discovered enough to encourage him to speak.\n\n'\"You, and I,\" he said, \"have each a great debt to settle with the man\nout yonder!  If we were neither of us cowards, we might combine to\ndischarge it.  Are you as soft as your brother?  Are you willing to\nendure to the last, and not once attempt a repayment?\"\n\n'\"I'm weary of enduring now,\" I replied; \"and I'd be glad of a\nretaliation that wouldn't recoil on myself; but treachery and violence\nare spears pointed at both ends; they wound those who resort to them\nworse than their enemies.\"\n\n'\"Treachery and violence are a just return for treachery and violence!\"\ncried Hindley.  \"Mrs. Heathcliff, I'll ask you to do nothing; but sit\nstill and be dumb.  Tell me now, can you?  I'm sure you would have as\nmuch pleasure as I in witnessing the conclusion of the fiend's existence;\nhe'll be _your_ death unless you overreach him; and he'll be _my_ ruin.\nDamn the hellish villain!  He knocks at the door as if he were master\nhere already!  Promise to hold your tongue, and before that clock\nstrikes--it wants three minutes of one--you're a free woman!\"\n\n'He took the implements which I described to you in my letter from his\nbreast, and would have turned down the candle.  I snatched it away,\nhowever, and seized his arm.\n\n'\"I'll not hold my tongue!\" I said; \"you mustn't touch him.  Let the door\nremain shut, and be quiet!\"\n\n'\"No!  I've formed my resolution, and by God I'll execute it!\" cried the\ndesperate being.  \"I'll do you a kindness in spite of yourself, and\nHareton justice!  And you needn't trouble your head to screen me;\nCatherine is gone.  Nobody alive would regret me, or be ashamed, though I\ncut my throat this minute--and it's time to make an end!\"\n\n'I might as well have struggled with a bear, or reasoned with a lunatic.\nThe only resource left me was to run to a lattice and warn his intended\nvictim of the fate which awaited him.\n\n'\"You'd better seek shelter somewhere else to-night!\" I exclaimed, in\nrather a triumphant tone.  \"Mr. Earnshaw has a mind to shoot you, if you\npersist in endeavouring to enter.\"\n\n'\"You'd better open the door, you--\" he answered, addressing me by some\nelegant term that I don't care to repeat.\n\n'\"I shall not meddle in the matter,\" I retorted again.  \"Come in and get\nshot, if you please.  I've done my duty.\"\n\n'With that I shut the window and returned to my place by the fire; having\ntoo small a stock of hypocrisy at my command to pretend any anxiety for\nthe danger that menaced him.  Earnshaw swore passionately at me:\naffirming that I loved the villain yet; and calling me all sorts of names\nfor the base spirit I evinced.  And I, in my secret heart (and conscience\nnever reproached me), thought what a blessing it would be for _him_\nshould Heathcliff put him out of misery; and what a blessing for _me_\nshould he send Heathcliff to his right abode!  As I sat nursing these\nreflections, the casement behind me was banged on to the floor by a blow\nfrom the latter individual, and his black countenance looked blightingly\nthrough.  The stanchions stood too close to suffer his shoulders to\nfollow, and I smiled, exulting in my fancied security.  His hair and\nclothes were whitened with snow, and his sharp cannibal teeth, revealed\nby cold and wrath, gleamed through the dark.\n\n'\"Isabella, let me in, or I'll make you repent!\" he \"girned,\" as Joseph\ncalls it.\n\n'\"I cannot commit murder,\" I replied.  \"Mr. Hindley stands sentinel with\na knife and loaded pistol.\"\n\n'\"Let me in by the kitchen door,\" he said.\n\n'\"Hindley will be there before me,\" I answered: \"and that's a poor love\nof yours that cannot bear a shower of snow!  We were left at peace in our\nbeds as long as the summer moon shone, but the moment a blast of winter\nreturns, you must run for shelter!  Heathcliff, if I were you, I'd go\nstretch myself over her grave and die like a faithful dog.  The world is\nsurely not worth living in now, is it?  You had distinctly impressed on\nme the idea that Catherine was the whole joy of your life: I can't\nimagine how you think of surviving her loss.\"\n\n'\"He's there, is he?\" exclaimed my companion, rushing to the gap.  \"If I\ncan get my arm out I can hit him!\"\n\n'I'm afraid, Ellen, you'll set me down as really wicked; but you don't\nknow all, so don't judge.  I wouldn't have aided or abetted an attempt on\neven _his_ life for anything.  Wish that he were dead, I must; and\ntherefore I was fearfully disappointed, and unnerved by terror for the\nconsequences of my taunting speech, when he flung himself on Earnshaw's\nweapon and wrenched it from his grasp.\n\n'The charge exploded, and the knife, in springing back, closed into its\nowner's wrist.  Heathcliff pulled it away by main force, slitting up the\nflesh as it passed on, and thrust it dripping into his pocket.  He then\ntook a stone, struck down the division between two windows, and sprang\nin.  His adversary had fallen senseless with excessive pain and the flow\nof blood, that gushed from an artery or a large vein.  The ruffian kicked\nand trampled on him, and dashed his head repeatedly against the flags,\nholding me with one hand, meantime, to prevent me summoning Joseph.  He\nexerted preterhuman self-denial in abstaining from finishing him\ncompletely; but getting out of breath, he finally desisted, and dragged\nthe apparently inanimate body on to the settle.  There he tore off the\nsleeve of Earnshaw's coat, and bound up the wound with brutal roughness;\nspitting and cursing during the operation as energetically as he had\nkicked before.  Being at liberty, I lost no time in seeking the old\nservant; who, having gathered by degrees the purport of my hasty tale,\nhurried below, gasping, as he descended the steps two at once.\n\n'\"What is ther to do, now? what is ther to do, now?\"\n\n'\"There's this to do,\" thundered Heathcliff, \"that your master's mad; and\nshould he last another month, I'll have him to an asylum.  And how the\ndevil did you come to fasten me out, you toothless hound?  Don't stand\nmuttering and mumbling there.  Come, I'm not going to nurse him.  Wash\nthat stuff away; and mind the sparks of your candle--it is more than half\nbrandy!\"\n\n'\"And so ye've been murthering on him?\" exclaimed Joseph, lifting his\nhands and eyes in horror.  \"If iver I seed a seeght loike this!  May the\nLord--\"\n\n'Heathcliff gave him a push on to his knees in the middle of the blood,\nand flung a towel to him; but instead of proceeding to dry it up, he\njoined his hands and began a prayer, which excited my laughter from its\nodd phraseology.  I was in the condition of mind to be shocked at\nnothing: in fact, I was as reckless as some malefactors show themselves\nat the foot of the gallows.\n\n'\"Oh, I forgot you,\" said the tyrant.  \"You shall do that.  Down with\nyou.  And you conspire with him against me, do you, viper?  There, that\nis work fit for you!\"\n\n'He shook me till my teeth rattled, and pitched me beside Joseph, who\nsteadily concluded his supplications, and then rose, vowing he would set\noff for the Grange directly.  Mr. Linton was a magistrate, and though he\nhad fifty wives dead, he should inquire into this.  He was so obstinate\nin his resolution, that Heathcliff deemed it expedient to compel from my\nlips a recapitulation of what had taken place; standing over me, heaving\nwith malevolence, as I reluctantly delivered the account in answer to his\nquestions.  It required a great deal of labour to satisfy the old man\nthat Heathcliff was not the aggressor; especially with my hardly-wrung\nreplies.  However, Mr. Earnshaw soon convinced him that he was alive\nstill; Joseph hastened to administer a dose of spirits, and by their\nsuccour his master presently regained motion and consciousness.\nHeathcliff, aware that his opponent was ignorant of the treatment\nreceived while insensible, called him deliriously intoxicated; and said\nhe should not notice his atrocious conduct further, but advised him to\nget to bed.  To my joy, he left us, after giving this judicious counsel,\nand Hindley stretched himself on the hearthstone.  I departed to my own\nroom, marvelling that I had escaped so easily.\n\n'This morning, when I came down, about half an hour before noon, Mr.\nEarnshaw was sitting by the fire, deadly sick; his evil genius, almost as\ngaunt and ghastly, leant against the chimney.  Neither appeared inclined\nto dine, and, having waited till all was cold on the table, I commenced\nalone.  Nothing hindered me from eating heartily, and I experienced a\ncertain sense of satisfaction and superiority, as, at intervals, I cast a\nlook towards my silent companions, and felt the comfort of a quiet\nconscience within me.  After I had done, I ventured on the unusual\nliberty of drawing near the fire, going round Earnshaw's seat, and\nkneeling in the corner beside him.\n\n'Heathcliff did not glance my way, and I gazed up, and contemplated his\nfeatures almost as confidently as if they had been turned to stone.  His\nforehead, that I once thought so manly, and that I now think so\ndiabolical, was shaded with a heavy cloud; his basilisk eyes were nearly\nquenched by sleeplessness, and weeping, perhaps, for the lashes were wet\nthen: his lips devoid of their ferocious sneer, and sealed in an\nexpression of unspeakable sadness.  Had it been another, I would have\ncovered my face in the presence of such grief.  In _his_ case, I was\ngratified; and, ignoble as it seems to insult a fallen enemy, I couldn't\nmiss this chance of sticking in a dart: his weakness was the only time\nwhen I could taste the delight of paying wrong for wrong.'\n\n'Fie, fie, Miss!' I interrupted.  'One might suppose you had never opened\na Bible in your life.  If God afflict your enemies, surely that ought to\nsuffice you.  It is both mean and presumptuous to add your torture to\nhis!'\n\n'In general I'll allow that it would be, Ellen,' she continued; 'but what\nmisery laid on Heathcliff could content me, unless I have a hand in it?\nI'd rather he suffered less, if I might cause his sufferings and he might\n_know_ that I was the cause.  Oh, I owe him so much.  On only one\ncondition can I hope to forgive him.  It is, if I may take an eye for an\neye, a tooth for a tooth; for every wrench of agony return a wrench:\nreduce him to my level.  As he was the first to injure, make him the\nfirst to implore pardon; and then--why then, Ellen, I might show you some\ngenerosity.  But it is utterly impossible I can ever be revenged, and\ntherefore I cannot forgive him.  Hindley wanted some water, and I handed\nhim a glass, and asked him how he was.\n\n'\"Not as ill as I wish,\" he replied.  \"But leaving out my arm, every inch\nof me is as sore as if I had been fighting with a legion of imps!\"\n\n'\"Yes, no wonder,\" was my next remark.  \"Catherine used to boast that she\nstood between you and bodily harm: she meant that certain persons would\nnot hurt you for fear of offending her.  It's well people don't _really_\nrise from their grave, or, last night, she might have witnessed a\nrepulsive scene!  Are not you bruised, and cut over your chest and\nshoulders?\"\n\n'\"I can't say,\" he answered, \"but what do you mean?  Did he dare to\nstrike me when I was down?\"\n\n'\"He trampled on and kicked you, and dashed you on the ground,\" I\nwhispered.  \"And his mouth watered to tear you with his teeth; because\nhe's only half man: not so much, and the rest fiend.\"\n\n'Mr. Earnshaw looked up, like me, to the countenance of our mutual foe;\nwho, absorbed in his anguish, seemed insensible to anything around him:\nthe longer he stood, the plainer his reflections revealed their blackness\nthrough his features.\n\n'\"Oh, if God would but give me strength to strangle him in my last agony,\nI'd go to hell with joy,\" groaned the impatient man, writhing to rise,\nand sinking back in despair, convinced of his inadequacy for the\nstruggle.\n\n'\"Nay, it's enough that he has murdered one of you,\" I observed aloud.\n\"At the Grange, every one knows your sister would have been living now\nhad it not been for Mr. Heathcliff.  After all, it is preferable to be\nhated than loved by him.  When I recollect how happy we were--how happy\nCatherine was before he came--I'm fit to curse the day.\"\n\n'Most likely, Heathcliff noticed more the truth of what was said, than\nthe spirit of the person who said it.  His attention was roused, I saw,\nfor his eyes rained down tears among the ashes, and he drew his breath in\nsuffocating sighs.  I stared full at him, and laughed scornfully.  The\nclouded windows of hell flashed a moment towards me; the fiend which\nusually looked out, however, was so dimmed and drowned that I did not\nfear to hazard another sound of derision.\n\n'\"Get up, and begone out of my sight,\" said the mourner.\n\n'I guessed he uttered those words, at least, though his voice was hardly\nintelligible.\n\n'\"I beg your pardon,\" I replied.  \"But I loved Catherine too; and her\nbrother requires attendance, which, for her sake, I shall supply.  Now,\nthat she's dead, I see her in Hindley: Hindley has exactly her eyes, if\nyou had not tried to gouge them out, and made them black and red; and\nher--\"\n\n'\"Get up, wretched idiot, before I stamp you to death!\" he cried, making\na movement that caused me to make one also.\n\n'\"But then,\" I continued, holding myself ready to flee, \"if poor\nCatherine had trusted you, and assumed the ridiculous, contemptible,\ndegrading title of Mrs. Heathcliff, she would soon have presented a\nsimilar picture!  _She_ wouldn't have borne your abominable behaviour\nquietly: her detestation and disgust must have found voice.\"\n\n'The back of the settle and Earnshaw's person interposed between me and\nhim; so instead of endeavouring to reach me, he snatched a dinner-knife\nfrom the table and flung it at my head.  It struck beneath my ear, and\nstopped the sentence I was uttering; but, pulling it out, I sprang to the\ndoor and delivered another; which I hope went a little deeper than his\nmissile.  The last glimpse I caught of him was a furious rush on his\npart, checked by the embrace of his host; and both fell locked together\non the hearth.  In my flight through the kitchen I bid Joseph speed to\nhis master; I knocked over Hareton, who was hanging a litter of puppies\nfrom a chair-back in the doorway; and, blessed as a soul escaped from\npurgatory, I bounded, leaped, and flew down the steep road; then,\nquitting its windings, shot direct across the moor, rolling over banks,\nand wading through marshes: precipitating myself, in fact, towards the\nbeacon-light of the Grange.  And far rather would I be condemned to a\nperpetual dwelling in the infernal regions than, even for one night,\nabide beneath the roof of Wuthering Heights again.'\n\nIsabella ceased speaking, and took a drink of tea; then she rose, and\nbidding me put on her bonnet, and a great shawl I had brought, and\nturning a deaf ear to my entreaties for her to remain another hour, she\nstepped on to a chair, kissed Edgar's and Catherine's portraits, bestowed\na similar salute on me, and descended to the carriage, accompanied by\nFanny, who yelped wild with joy at recovering her mistress.  She was\ndriven away, never to revisit this neighbourhood: but a regular\ncorrespondence was established between her and my master when things were\nmore settled.  I believe her new abode was in the south, near London;\nthere she had a son born a few months subsequent to her escape.  He was\nchristened Linton, and, from the first, she reported him to be an ailing,\npeevish creature.\n\nMr. Heathcliff, meeting me one day in the village, inquired where she\nlived.  I refused to tell.  He remarked that it was not of any moment,\nonly she must beware of coming to her brother: she should not be with\nhim, if he had to keep her himself.  Though I would give no information,\nhe discovered, through some of the other servants, both her place of\nresidence and the existence of the child.  Still, he didn't molest her:\nfor which forbearance she might thank his aversion, I suppose.  He often\nasked about the infant, when he saw me; and on hearing its name, smiled\ngrimly, and observed: 'They wish me to hate it too, do they?'\n\n'I don't think they wish you to know anything about it,' I answered.\n\n'But I'll have it,' he said, 'when I want it.  They may reckon on that!'\n\nFortunately its mother died before the time arrived; some thirteen years\nafter the decease of Catherine, when Linton was twelve, or a little more.\n\nOn the day succeeding Isabella's unexpected visit I had no opportunity of\nspeaking to my master: he shunned conversation, and was fit for\ndiscussing nothing.  When I could get him to listen, I saw it pleased him\nthat his sister had left her husband; whom he abhorred with an intensity\nwhich the mildness of his nature would scarcely seem to allow.  So deep\nand sensitive was his aversion, that he refrained from going anywhere\nwhere he was likely to see or hear of Heathcliff.  Grief, and that\ntogether, transformed him into a complete hermit: he threw up his office\nof magistrate, ceased even to attend church, avoided the village on all\noccasions, and spent a life of entire seclusion within the limits of his\npark and grounds; only varied by solitary rambles on the moors, and\nvisits to the grave of his wife, mostly at evening, or early morning\nbefore other wanderers were abroad.  But he was too good to be thoroughly\nunhappy long.  _He_ didn't pray for Catherine's soul to haunt him.  Time\nbrought resignation, and a melancholy sweeter than common joy.  He\nrecalled her memory with ardent, tender love, and hopeful aspiring to the\nbetter world; where he doubted not she was gone.\n\nAnd he had earthly consolation and affections also.  For a few days, I\nsaid, he seemed regardless of the puny successor to the departed: that\ncoldness melted as fast as snow in April, and ere the tiny thing could\nstammer a word or totter a step it wielded a despot's sceptre in his\nheart.  It was named Catherine; but he never called it the name in full,\nas he had never called the first Catherine short: probably because\nHeathcliff had a habit of doing so.  The little one was always Cathy: it\nformed to him a distinction from the mother, and yet a connection with\nher; and his attachment sprang from its relation to her, far more than\nfrom its being his own.\n\nI used to draw a comparison between him and Hindley Earnshaw, and perplex\nmyself to explain satisfactorily why their conduct was so opposite in\nsimilar circumstances.  They had both been fond husbands, and were both\nattached to their children; and I could not see how they shouldn't both\nhave taken the same road, for good or evil.  But, I thought in my mind,\nHindley, with apparently the stronger head, has shown himself sadly the\nworse and the weaker man.  When his ship struck, the captain abandoned\nhis post; and the crew, instead of trying to save her, rushed into riot\nand confusion, leaving no hope for their luckless vessel.  Linton, on the\ncontrary, displayed the true courage of a loyal and faithful soul: he\ntrusted God; and God comforted him.  One hoped, and the other despaired:\nthey chose their own lots, and were righteously doomed to endure them.\nBut you'll not want to hear my moralising, Mr. Lockwood; you'll judge, as\nwell as I can, all these things: at least, you'll think you will, and\nthat's the same.  The end of Earnshaw was what might have been expected;\nit followed fast on his sister's: there were scarcely six months between\nthem.  We, at the Grange, never got a very succinct account of his state\npreceding it; all that I did learn was on occasion of going to aid in the\npreparations for the funeral.  Mr. Kenneth came to announce the event to\nmy master.\n\n'Well, Nelly,' said he, riding into the yard one morning, too early not\nto alarm me with an instant presentiment of bad news, 'it's yours and my\nturn to go into mourning at present.  Who's given us the slip now, do you\nthink?'\n\n'Who?' I asked in a flurry.\n\n'Why, guess!' he returned, dismounting, and slinging his bridle on a hook\nby the door.  'And nip up the corner of your apron: I'm certain you'll\nneed it.'\n\n'Not Mr. Heathcliff, surely?' I exclaimed.\n\n'What! would you have tears for him?' said the doctor.  'No, Heathcliff's\na tough young fellow: he looks blooming to-day.  I've just seen him.  He's\nrapidly regaining flesh since he lost his better half.'\n\n'Who is it, then, Mr. Kenneth?' I repeated impatiently.\n\n'Hindley Earnshaw!  Your old friend Hindley,' he replied, 'and my wicked\ngossip: though he's been too wild for me this long while.  There!  I said\nwe should draw water.  But cheer up!  He died true to his character:\ndrunk as a lord.  Poor lad!  I'm sorry, too.  One can't help missing an\nold companion: though he had the worst tricks with him that ever man\nimagined, and has done me many a rascally turn.  He's barely\ntwenty-seven, it seems; that's your own age: who would have thought you\nwere born in one year?'\n\nI confess this blow was greater to me than the shock of Mrs. Linton's\ndeath: ancient associations lingered round my heart; I sat down in the\nporch and wept as for a blood relation, desiring Mr. Kenneth to get\nanother servant to introduce him to the master.  I could not hinder\nmyself from pondering on the question--'Had he had fair play?'  Whatever\nI did, that idea would bother me: it was so tiresomely pertinacious that\nI resolved on requesting leave to go to Wuthering Heights, and assist in\nthe last duties to the dead.  Mr. Linton was extremely reluctant to\nconsent, but I pleaded eloquently for the friendless condition in which\nhe lay; and I said my old master and foster-brother had a claim on my\nservices as strong as his own.  Besides, I reminded him that the child\nHareton was his wife's nephew, and, in the absence of nearer kin, he\nought to act as its guardian; and he ought to and must inquire how the\nproperty was left, and look over the concerns of his brother-in-law.  He\nwas unfit for attending to such matters then, but he bid me speak to his\nlawyer; and at length permitted me to go.  His lawyer had been Earnshaw's\nalso: I called at the village, and asked him to accompany me.  He shook\nhis head, and advised that Heathcliff should be let alone; affirming, if\nthe truth were known, Hareton would be found little else than a beggar.\n\n'His father died in debt,' he said; 'the whole property is mortgaged, and\nthe sole chance for the natural heir is to allow him an opportunity of\ncreating some interest in the creditor's heart, that he may be inclined\nto deal leniently towards him.'\n\nWhen I reached the Heights, I explained that I had come to see everything\ncarried on decently; and Joseph, who appeared in sufficient distress,\nexpressed satisfaction at my presence.  Mr. Heathcliff said he did not\nperceive that I was wanted; but I might stay and order the arrangements\nfor the funeral, if I chose.\n\n'Correctly,' he remarked, 'that fool's body should be buried at the\ncross-roads, without ceremony of any kind. I happened to leave him ten\nminutes yesterday afternoon, and in that interval he fastened the two\ndoors of the house against me, and he has spent the night in drinking\nhimself to death deliberately! We broke in this morning, for we heard\nhim sporting like a horse; and there he was, laid over the settle:\nflaying and scalping would not have wakened him. I sent for Kenneth, and\nhe came; but not till the beast had changed into carrion: he was both\ndead and cold, and stark; and so you'll allow it was useless making more\nstir about him!'\n\nThe old servant confirmed this statement, but muttered:\n\n'I'd rayther he'd goan hisseln for t' doctor!  I sud ha' taen tent o' t'\nmaister better nor him--and he warn't deead when I left, naught o' t'\nsoart!'\n\nI insisted on the funeral being respectable.  Mr. Heathcliff said I might\nhave my own way there too: only, he desired me to remember that the money\nfor the whole affair came out of his pocket.  He maintained a hard,\ncareless deportment, indicative of neither joy nor sorrow: if anything,\nit expressed a flinty gratification at a piece of difficult work\nsuccessfully executed.  I observed once, indeed, something like\nexultation in his aspect: it was just when the people were bearing the\ncoffin from the house.  He had the hypocrisy to represent a mourner: and\nprevious to following with Hareton, he lifted the unfortunate child on to\nthe table and muttered, with peculiar gusto, 'Now, my bonny lad, you are\n_mine_!  And we'll see if one tree won't grow as crooked as another, with\nthe same wind to twist it!'  The unsuspecting thing was pleased at this\nspeech: he played with Heathcliff's whiskers, and stroked his cheek; but\nI divined its meaning, and observed tartly, 'That boy must go back with\nme to Thrushcross Grange, sir.  There is nothing in the world less yours\nthan he is!'\n\n'Does Linton say so?' he demanded.\n\n'Of course--he has ordered me to take him,' I replied.\n\n'Well,' said the scoundrel, 'we'll not argue the subject now: but I have\na fancy to try my hand at rearing a young one; so intimate to your master\nthat I must supply the place of this with my own, if he attempt to remove\nit.  I don't engage to let Hareton go undisputed; but I'll be pretty sure\nto make the other come!  Remember to tell him.'\n\nThis hint was enough to bind our hands.  I repeated its substance on my\nreturn; and Edgar Linton, little interested at the commencement, spoke no\nmore of interfering.  I'm not aware that he could have done it to any\npurpose, had he been ever so willing.\n\nThe guest was now the master of Wuthering Heights: he held firm\npossession, and proved to the attorney--who, in his turn, proved it to\nMr. Linton--that Earnshaw had mortgaged every yard of land he owned for\ncash to supply his mania for gaming; and he, Heathcliff, was the\nmortgagee.  In that manner Hareton, who should now be the first gentleman\nin the neighbourhood, was reduced to a state of complete dependence on\nhis father's inveterate enemy; and lives in his own house as a servant,\ndeprived of the advantage of wages: quite unable to right himself,\nbecause of his friendlessness, and his ignorance that he has been\nwronged.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVIII\n\n\nThe twelve years, continued Mrs. Dean, following that dismal period were\nthe happiest of my life: my greatest troubles in their passage rose from\nour little lady's trifling illnesses, which she had to experience in\ncommon with all children, rich and poor.  For the rest, after the first\nsix months, she grew like a larch, and could walk and talk too, in her\nown way, before the heath blossomed a second time over Mrs. Linton's\ndust.  She was the most winning thing that ever brought sunshine into a\ndesolate house: a real beauty in face, with the Earnshaws' handsome dark\neyes, but the Lintons' fair skin and small features, and yellow curling\nhair.  Her spirit was high, though not rough, and qualified by a heart\nsensitive and lively to excess in its affections.  That capacity for\nintense attachments reminded me of her mother: still she did not resemble\nher: for she could be soft and mild as a dove, and she had a gentle voice\nand pensive expression: her anger was never furious; her love never\nfierce: it was deep and tender.  However, it must be acknowledged, she\nhad faults to foil her gifts.  A propensity to be saucy was one; and a\nperverse will, that indulged children invariably acquire, whether they be\ngood tempered or cross.  If a servant chanced to vex her, it was\nalways--'I shall tell papa!'  And if he reproved her, even by a look, you\nwould have thought it a heart-breaking business: I don't believe he ever\ndid speak a harsh word to her.  He took her education entirely on\nhimself, and made it an amusement.  Fortunately, curiosity and a quick\nintellect made her an apt scholar: she learned rapidly and eagerly, and\ndid honour to his teaching.\n\nTill she reached the age of thirteen she had not once been beyond the\nrange of the park by herself.  Mr. Linton would take her with him a mile\nor so outside, on rare occasions; but he trusted her to no one else.\nGimmerton was an unsubstantial name in her ears; the chapel, the only\nbuilding she had approached or entered, except her own home.  Wuthering\nHeights and Mr. Heathcliff did not exist for her: she was a perfect\nrecluse; and, apparently, perfectly contented.  Sometimes, indeed, while\nsurveying the country from her nursery window, she would observe--\n\n'Ellen, how long will it be before I can walk to the top of those hills?\nI wonder what lies on the other side--is it the sea?'\n\n'No, Miss Cathy,' I would answer; 'it is hills again, just like these.'\n\n'And what are those golden rocks like when you stand under them?' she\nonce asked.\n\nThe abrupt descent of Penistone Crags particularly attracted her notice;\nespecially when the setting sun shone on it and the topmost heights, and\nthe whole extent of landscape besides lay in shadow.  I explained that\nthey were bare masses of stone, with hardly enough earth in their clefts\nto nourish a stunted tree.\n\n'And why are they bright so long after it is evening here?' she pursued.\n\n'Because they are a great deal higher up than we are,' replied I; 'you\ncould not climb them, they are too high and steep.  In winter the frost\nis always there before it comes to us; and deep into summer I have found\nsnow under that black hollow on the north-east side!'\n\n'Oh, you have been on them!' she cried gleefully.  'Then I can go, too,\nwhen I am a woman.  Has papa been, Ellen?'\n\n'Papa would tell you, Miss,' I answered, hastily, 'that they are not\nworth the trouble of visiting.  The moors, where you ramble with him, are\nmuch nicer; and Thrushcross Park is the finest place in the world.'\n\n'But I know the park, and I don't know those,' she murmured to herself.\n'And I should delight to look round me from the brow of that tallest\npoint: my little pony Minny shall take me some time.'\n\nOne of the maids mentioning the Fairy Cave, quite turned her head with a\ndesire to fulfil this project: she teased Mr. Linton about it; and he\npromised she should have the journey when she got older.  But Miss\nCatherine measured her age by months, and, 'Now, am I old enough to go to\nPenistone Crags?' was the constant question in her mouth.  The road\nthither wound close by Wuthering Heights.  Edgar had not the heart to\npass it; so she received as constantly the answer, 'Not yet, love: not\nyet.'\n\nI said Mrs. Heathcliff lived above a dozen years after quitting her\nhusband.  Her family were of a delicate constitution: she and Edgar both\nlacked the ruddy health that you will generally meet in these parts.  What\nher last illness was, I am not certain: I conjecture, they died of the\nsame thing, a kind of fever, slow at its commencement, but incurable, and\nrapidly consuming life towards the close.  She wrote to inform her\nbrother of the probable conclusion of a four-months' indisposition under\nwhich she had suffered, and entreated him to come to her, if possible;\nfor she had much to settle, and she wished to bid him adieu, and deliver\nLinton safely into his hands.  Her hope was that Linton might be left\nwith him, as he had been with her: his father, she would fain convince\nherself, had no desire to assume the burden of his maintenance or\neducation.  My master hesitated not a moment in complying with her\nrequest: reluctant as he was to leave home at ordinary calls, he flew to\nanswer this; commanding Catherine to my peculiar vigilance, in his\nabsence, with reiterated orders that she must not wander out of the park,\neven under my escort he did not calculate on her going unaccompanied.\n\nHe was away three weeks.  The first day or two my charge sat in a corner\nof the library, too sad for either reading or playing: in that quiet\nstate she caused me little trouble; but it was succeeded by an interval\nof impatient, fretful weariness; and being too busy, and too old then, to\nrun up and down amusing her, I hit on a method by which she might\nentertain herself.  I used to send her on her travels round the\ngrounds--now on foot, and now on a pony; indulging her with a patient\naudience of all her real and imaginary adventures when she returned.\n\nThe summer shone in full prime; and she took such a taste for this\nsolitary rambling that she often contrived to remain out from breakfast\ntill tea; and then the evenings were spent in recounting her fanciful\ntales.  I did not fear her breaking bounds; because the gates were\ngenerally locked, and I thought she would scarcely venture forth alone,\nif they had stood wide open.  Unluckily, my confidence proved misplaced.\nCatherine came to me, one morning, at eight o'clock, and said she was\nthat day an Arabian merchant, going to cross the Desert with his caravan;\nand I must give her plenty of provision for herself and beasts: a horse,\nand three camels, personated by a large hound and a couple of pointers.  I\ngot together good store of dainties, and slung them in a basket on one\nside of the saddle; and she sprang up as gay as a fairy, sheltered by her\nwide-brimmed hat and gauze veil from the July sun, and trotted off with a\nmerry laugh, mocking my cautious counsel to avoid galloping, and come\nback early.  The naughty thing never made her appearance at tea.  One\ntraveller, the hound, being an old dog and fond of its ease, returned;\nbut neither Cathy, nor the pony, nor the two pointers were visible in any\ndirection: I despatched emissaries down this path, and that path, and at\nlast went wandering in search of her myself.  There was a labourer\nworking at a fence round a plantation, on the borders of the grounds.  I\ninquired of him if he had seen our young lady.\n\n'I saw her at morn,' he replied: 'she would have me to cut her a hazel\nswitch, and then she leapt her Galloway over the hedge yonder, where it\nis lowest, and galloped out of sight.'\n\nYou may guess how I felt at hearing this news.  It struck me directly she\nmust have started for Penistone Crags.  'What will become of her?' I\nejaculated, pushing through a gap which the man was repairing, and making\nstraight to the high-road.  I walked as if for a wager, mile after mile,\ntill a turn brought me in view of the Heights; but no Catherine could I\ndetect, far or near.  The Crags lie about a mile and a half beyond Mr.\nHeathcliff's place, and that is four from the Grange, so I began to fear\nnight would fall ere I could reach them.  'And what if she should have\nslipped in clambering among them,' I reflected, 'and been killed, or\nbroken some of her bones?'  My suspense was truly painful; and, at first,\nit gave me delightful relief to observe, in hurrying by the farmhouse,\nCharlie, the fiercest of the pointers, lying under a window, with swelled\nhead and bleeding ear.  I opened the wicket and ran to the door, knocking\nvehemently for admittance.  A woman whom I knew, and who formerly lived\nat Gimmerton, answered: she had been servant there since the death of Mr.\nEarnshaw.\n\n'Ah,' said she, 'you are come a-seeking your little mistress!  Don't be\nfrightened.  She's here safe: but I'm glad it isn't the master.'\n\n'He is not at home then, is he?' I panted, quite breathless with quick\nwalking and alarm.\n\n'No, no,' she replied: 'both he and Joseph are off, and I think they\nwon't return this hour or more.  Step in and rest you a bit.'\n\nI entered, and beheld my stray lamb seated on the hearth, rocking herself\nin a little chair that had been her mother's when a child.  Her hat was\nhung against the wall, and she seemed perfectly at home, laughing and\nchattering, in the best spirits imaginable, to Hareton--now a great,\nstrong lad of eighteen--who stared at her with considerable curiosity and\nastonishment: comprehending precious little of the fluent succession of\nremarks and questions which her tongue never ceased pouring forth.\n\n'Very well, Miss!' I exclaimed, concealing my joy under an angry\ncountenance.  'This is your last ride, till papa comes back.  I'll not\ntrust you over the threshold again, you naughty, naughty girl!'\n\n'Aha, Ellen!' she cried, gaily, jumping up and running to my side.  'I\nshall have a pretty story to tell to-night; and so you've found me out.\nHave you ever been here in your life before?'\n\n'Put that hat on, and home at once,' said I.  'I'm dreadfully grieved at\nyou, Miss Cathy: you've done extremely wrong!  It's no use pouting and\ncrying: that won't repay the trouble I've had, scouring the country after\nyou.  To think how Mr. Linton charged me to keep you in; and you stealing\noff so!  It shows you are a cunning little fox, and nobody will put faith\nin you any more.'\n\n'What have I done?' sobbed she, instantly checked.  'Papa charged me\nnothing: he'll not scold me, Ellen--he's never cross, like you!'\n\n'Come, come!' I repeated.  'I'll tie the riband.  Now, let us have no\npetulance.  Oh, for shame!  You thirteen years old, and such a baby!'\n\nThis exclamation was caused by her pushing the hat from her head, and\nretreating to the chimney out of my reach.\n\n'Nay,' said the servant, 'don't be hard on the bonny lass, Mrs. Dean.  We\nmade her stop: she'd fain have ridden forwards, afeard you should be\nuneasy.  Hareton offered to go with her, and I thought he should: it's a\nwild road over the hills.'\n\nHareton, during the discussion, stood with his hands in his pockets, too\nawkward to speak; though he looked as if he did not relish my intrusion.\n\n'How long am I to wait?' I continued, disregarding the woman's\ninterference.  'It will be dark in ten minutes.  Where is the pony, Miss\nCathy?  And where is Phoenix?  I shall leave you, unless you be quick; so\nplease yourself.'\n\n'The pony is in the yard,' she replied, 'and Phoenix is shut in there.\nHe's bitten--and so is Charlie.  I was going to tell you all about it;\nbut you are in a bad temper, and don't deserve to hear.'\n\nI picked up her hat, and approached to reinstate it; but perceiving that\nthe people of the house took her part, she commenced capering round the\nroom; and on my giving chase, ran like a mouse over and under and behind\nthe furniture, rendering it ridiculous for me to pursue.  Hareton and the\nwoman laughed, and she joined them, and waxed more impertinent still;\ntill I cried, in great irritation,--'Well, Miss Cathy, if you were aware\nwhose house this is you'd be glad enough to get out.'\n\n'It's _your_ father's, isn't it?' said she, turning to Hareton.\n\n'Nay,' he replied, looking down, and blushing bashfully.\n\nHe could not stand a steady gaze from her eyes, though they were just his\nown.\n\n'Whose then--your master's?' she asked.\n\nHe coloured deeper, with a different feeling, muttered an oath, and\nturned away.\n\n'Who is his master?' continued the tiresome girl, appealing to me.  'He\ntalked about \"our house,\" and \"our folk.\"  I thought he had been the\nowner's son.  And he never said Miss: he should have done, shouldn't he,\nif he's a servant?'\n\nHareton grew black as a thunder-cloud at this childish speech.  I\nsilently shook my questioner, and at last succeeded in equipping her for\ndeparture.\n\n'Now, get my horse,' she said, addressing her unknown kinsman as she\nwould one of the stable-boys at the Grange.  'And you may come with me.  I\nwant to see where the goblin-hunter rises in the marsh, and to hear about\nthe _fairishes_, as you call them: but make haste!  What's the matter?\nGet my horse, I say.'\n\n'I'll see thee damned before I be _thy_ servant!' growled the lad.\n\n'You'll see me _what_!' asked Catherine in surprise.\n\n'Damned--thou saucy witch!' he replied.\n\n'There, Miss Cathy! you see you have got into pretty company,' I\ninterposed.  'Nice words to be used to a young lady!  Pray don't begin to\ndispute with him.  Come, let us seek for Minny ourselves, and begone.'\n\n'But, Ellen,' cried she, staring fixed in astonishment, 'how dare he\nspeak so to me?  Mustn't he be made to do as I ask him?  You wicked\ncreature, I shall tell papa what you said.--Now, then!'\n\nHareton did not appear to feel this threat; so the tears sprang into her\neyes with indignation.  'You bring the pony,' she exclaimed, turning to\nthe woman, 'and let my dog free this moment!'\n\n'Softly, Miss,' answered she addressed; 'you'll lose nothing by being\ncivil.  Though Mr. Hareton, there, be not the master's son, he's your\ncousin: and I was never hired to serve you.'\n\n'_He_ my cousin!' cried Cathy, with a scornful laugh.\n\n'Yes, indeed,' responded her reprover.\n\n'Oh, Ellen! don't let them say such things,' she pursued in great\ntrouble.  'Papa is gone to fetch my cousin from London: my cousin is a\ngentleman's son.  That my--' she stopped, and wept outright; upset at the\nbare notion of relationship with such a clown.\n\n'Hush, hush!' I whispered; 'people can have many cousins and of all\nsorts, Miss Cathy, without being any the worse for it; only they needn't\nkeep their company, if they be disagreeable and bad.'\n\n'He's not--he's not my cousin, Ellen!' she went on, gathering fresh grief\nfrom reflection, and flinging herself into my arms for refuge from the\nidea.\n\nI was much vexed at her and the servant for their mutual revelations;\nhaving no doubt of Linton's approaching arrival, communicated by the\nformer, being reported to Mr. Heathcliff; and feeling as confident that\nCatherine's first thought on her father's return would be to seek an\nexplanation of the latter's assertion concerning her rude-bred kindred.\nHareton, recovering from his disgust at being taken for a servant, seemed\nmoved by her distress; and, having fetched the pony round to the door, he\ntook, to propitiate her, a fine crooked-legged terrier whelp from the\nkennel, and putting it into her hand, bid her whist! for he meant nought.\nPausing in her lamentations, she surveyed him with a glance of awe and\nhorror, then burst forth anew.\n\nI could scarcely refrain from smiling at this antipathy to the poor\nfellow; who was a well-made, athletic youth, good-looking in features,\nand stout and healthy, but attired in garments befitting his daily\noccupations of working on the farm and lounging among the moors after\nrabbits and game.  Still, I thought I could detect in his physiognomy a\nmind owning better qualities than his father ever possessed.  Good things\nlost amid a wilderness of weeds, to be sure, whose rankness far\nover-topped their neglected growth; yet, notwithstanding, evidence of a\nwealthy soil, that might yield luxuriant crops under other and favourable\ncircumstances.  Mr. Heathcliff, I believe, had not treated him physically\nill; thanks to his fearless nature, which offered no temptation to that\ncourse of oppression: he had none of the timid susceptibility that would\nhave given zest to ill-treatment, in Heathcliff's judgment.  He appeared\nto have bent his malevolence on making him a brute: he was never taught\nto read or write; never rebuked for any bad habit which did not annoy his\nkeeper; never led a single step towards virtue, or guarded by a single\nprecept against vice.  And from what I heard, Joseph contributed much to\nhis deterioration, by a narrow-minded partiality which prompted him to\nflatter and pet him, as a boy, because he was the head of the old family.\nAnd as he had been in the habit of accusing Catherine Earnshaw and\nHeathcliff, when children, of putting the master past his patience, and\ncompelling him to seek solace in drink by what he termed their 'offald\nways,' so at present he laid the whole burden of Hareton's faults on the\nshoulders of the usurper of his property.  If the lad swore, he wouldn't\ncorrect him: nor however culpably he behaved.  It gave Joseph\nsatisfaction, apparently, to watch him go the worst lengths: he allowed\nthat the lad was ruined: that his soul was abandoned to perdition; but\nthen he reflected that Heathcliff must answer for it.  Hareton's blood\nwould be required at his hands; and there lay immense consolation in that\nthought.  Joseph had instilled into him a pride of name, and of his\nlineage; he would, had he dared, have fostered hate between him and the\npresent owner of the Heights: but his dread of that owner amounted to\nsuperstition; and he confined his feelings regarding him to muttered\ninnuendoes and private comminations.  I don't pretend to be intimately\nacquainted with the mode of living customary in those days at Wuthering\nHeights: I only speak from hearsay; for I saw little.  The villagers\naffirmed Mr. Heathcliff was _near_, and a cruel hard landlord to his\ntenants; but the house, inside, had regained its ancient aspect of\ncomfort under female management, and the scenes of riot common in\nHindley's time were not now enacted within its walls.  The master was too\ngloomy to seek companionship with any people, good or bad; and he is yet.\n\nThis, however, is not making progress with my story.  Miss Cathy rejected\nthe peace-offering of the terrier, and demanded her own dogs, Charlie and\nPhoenix.  They came limping and hanging their heads; and we set out for\nhome, sadly out of sorts, every one of us.  I could not wring from my\nlittle lady how she had spent the day; except that, as I supposed, the\ngoal of her pilgrimage was Penistone Crags; and she arrived without\nadventure to the gate of the farm-house, when Hareton happened to issue\nforth, attended by some canine followers, who attacked her train.  They\nhad a smart battle, before their owners could separate them: that formed\nan introduction.  Catherine told Hareton who she was, and where she was\ngoing; and asked him to show her the way: finally, beguiling him to\naccompany her.  He opened the mysteries of the Fairy Cave, and twenty\nother queer places.  But, being in disgrace, I was not favoured with a\ndescription of the interesting objects she saw.  I could gather, however,\nthat her guide had been a favourite till she hurt his feelings by\naddressing him as a servant; and Heathcliff's housekeeper hurt hers by\ncalling him her cousin.  Then the language he had held to her rankled in\nher heart; she who was always 'love,' and 'darling,' and 'queen,' and\n'angel,' with everybody at the Grange, to be insulted so shockingly by a\nstranger!  She did not comprehend it; and hard work I had to obtain a\npromise that she would not lay the grievance before her father.  I\nexplained how he objected to the whole household at the Heights, and how\nsorry he would be to find she had been there; but I insisted most on the\nfact, that if she revealed my negligence of his orders, he would perhaps\nbe so angry that I should have to leave; and Cathy couldn't bear that\nprospect: she pledged her word, and kept it for my sake.  After all, she\nwas a sweet little girl.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIX\n\n\nA letter, edged with black, announced the day of my master's return.\nIsabella was dead; and he wrote to bid me get mourning for his daughter,\nand arrange a room, and other accommodations, for his youthful nephew.\nCatherine ran wild with joy at the idea of welcoming her father back; and\nindulged most sanguine anticipations of the innumerable excellencies of\nher 'real' cousin.  The evening of their expected arrival came.  Since\nearly morning she had been busy ordering her own small affairs; and now\nattired in her new black frock--poor thing! her aunt's death impressed\nher with no definite sorrow--she obliged me, by constant worrying, to\nwalk with her down through the grounds to meet them.\n\n'Linton is just six months younger than I am,' she chattered, as we\nstrolled leisurely over the swells and hollows of mossy turf, under\nshadow of the trees.  'How delightful it will be to have him for a\nplayfellow!  Aunt Isabella sent papa a beautiful lock of his hair; it was\nlighter than mine--more flaxen, and quite as fine.  I have it carefully\npreserved in a little glass box; and I've often thought what a pleasure\nit would be to see its owner.  Oh! I am happy--and papa, dear, dear papa!\nCome, Ellen, let us run! come, run.'\n\nShe ran, and returned and ran again, many times before my sober footsteps\nreached the gate, and then she seated herself on the grassy bank beside\nthe path, and tried to wait patiently; but that was impossible: she\ncouldn't be still a minute.\n\n'How long they are!' she exclaimed.  'Ah, I see, some dust on the\nroad--they are coming!  No!  When will they be here?  May we not go a\nlittle way--half a mile, Ellen, only just half a mile?  Do say Yes: to\nthat clump of birches at the turn!'\n\nI refused staunchly.  At length her suspense was ended: the travelling\ncarriage rolled in sight.  Miss Cathy shrieked and stretched out her arms\nas soon as she caught her father's face looking from the window.  He\ndescended, nearly as eager as herself; and a considerable interval\nelapsed ere they had a thought to spare for any but themselves.  While\nthey exchanged caresses I took a peep in to see after Linton.  He was\nasleep in a corner, wrapped in a warm, fur-lined cloak, as if it had been\nwinter.  A pale, delicate, effeminate boy, who might have been taken for\nmy master's younger brother, so strong was the resemblance: but there was\na sickly peevishness in his aspect that Edgar Linton never had.  The\nlatter saw me looking; and having shaken hands, advised me to close the\ndoor, and leave him undisturbed; for the journey had fatigued him.  Cathy\nwould fain have taken one glance, but her father told her to come, and\nthey walked together up the park, while I hastened before to prepare the\nservants.\n\n'Now, darling,' said Mr. Linton, addressing his daughter, as they halted\nat the bottom of the front steps: 'your cousin is not so strong or so\nmerry as you are, and he has lost his mother, remember, a very short time\nsince; therefore, don't expect him to play and run about with you\ndirectly.  And don't harass him much by talking: let him be quiet this\nevening, at least, will you?'\n\n'Yes, yes, papa,' answered Catherine: 'but I do want to see him; and he\nhasn't once looked out.'\n\nThe carriage stopped; and the sleeper being roused, was lifted to the\nground by his uncle.\n\n'This is your cousin Cathy, Linton,' he said, putting their little hands\ntogether.  'She's fond of you already; and mind you don't grieve her by\ncrying to-night.  Try to be cheerful now; the travelling is at an end,\nand you have nothing to do but rest and amuse yourself as you please.'\n\n'Let me go to bed, then,' answered the boy, shrinking from Catherine's\nsalute; and he put his fingers to remove incipient tears.\n\n'Come, come, there's a good child,' I whispered, leading him in.  'You'll\nmake her weep too--see how sorry she is for you!'\n\nI do not know whether it was sorrow for him, but his cousin put on as sad\na countenance as himself, and returned to her father.  All three entered,\nand mounted to the library, where tea was laid ready.  I proceeded to\nremove Linton's cap and mantle, and placed him on a chair by the table;\nbut he was no sooner seated than he began to cry afresh.  My master\ninquired what was the matter.\n\n'I can't sit on a chair,' sobbed the boy.\n\n'Go to the sofa, then, and Ellen shall bring you some tea,' answered his\nuncle patiently.\n\nHe had been greatly tried, during the journey, I felt convinced, by his\nfretful ailing charge.  Linton slowly trailed himself off, and lay down.\nCathy carried a footstool and her cup to his side.  At first she sat\nsilent; but that could not last: she had resolved to make a pet of her\nlittle cousin, as she would have him to be; and she commenced stroking\nhis curls, and kissing his cheek, and offering him tea in her saucer,\nlike a baby.  This pleased him, for he was not much better: he dried his\neyes, and lightened into a faint smile.\n\n'Oh, he'll do very well,' said the master to me, after watching them a\nminute.  'Very well, if we can keep him, Ellen.  The company of a child\nof his own age will instil new spirit into him soon, and by wishing for\nstrength he'll gain it.'\n\n'Ay, if we can keep him!' I mused to myself; and sore misgivings came\nover me that there was slight hope of that.  And then, I thought, how\never will that weakling live at Wuthering Heights?  Between his father\nand Hareton, what playmates and instructors they'll be.  Our doubts were\npresently decided--even earlier than I expected.  I had just taken the\nchildren up-stairs, after tea was finished, and seen Linton asleep--he\nwould not suffer me to leave him till that was the case--I had come down,\nand was standing by the table in the hall, lighting a bedroom candle for\nMr. Edgar, when a maid stepped out of the kitchen and informed me that\nMr. Heathcliff's servant Joseph was at the door, and wished to speak with\nthe master.\n\n'I shall ask him what he wants first,' I said, in considerable\ntrepidation.  'A very unlikely hour to be troubling people, and the\ninstant they have returned from a long journey.  I don't think the master\ncan see him.'\n\nJoseph had advanced through the kitchen as I uttered these words, and now\npresented himself in the hall.  He was donned in his Sunday garments,\nwith his most sanctimonious and sourest face, and, holding his hat in one\nhand, and his stick in the other, he proceeded to clean his shoes on the\nmat.\n\n'Good-evening, Joseph,' I said, coldly.  'What business brings you here\nto-night?'\n\n'It's Maister Linton I mun spake to,' he answered, waving me disdainfully\naside.\n\n'Mr. Linton is going to bed; unless you have something particular to say,\nI'm sure he won't hear it now,' I continued.  'You had better sit down in\nthere, and entrust your message to me.'\n\n'Which is his rahm?' pursued the fellow, surveying the range of closed\ndoors.\n\nI perceived he was bent on refusing my mediation, so very reluctantly I\nwent up to the library, and announced the unseasonable visitor, advising\nthat he should be dismissed till next day.  Mr. Linton had no time to\nempower me to do so, for Joseph mounted close at my heels, and, pushing\ninto the apartment, planted himself at the far side of the table, with\nhis two fists clapped on the head of his stick, and began in an elevated\ntone, as if anticipating opposition--\n\n'Hathecliff has sent me for his lad, and I munn't goa back 'bout him.'\n\nEdgar Linton was silent a minute; an expression of exceeding sorrow\novercast his features: he would have pitied the child on his own account;\nbut, recalling Isabella's hopes and fears, and anxious wishes for her\nson, and her commendations of him to his care, he grieved bitterly at the\nprospect of yielding him up, and searched in his heart how it might be\navoided.  No plan offered itself: the very exhibition of any desire to\nkeep him would have rendered the claimant more peremptory: there was\nnothing left but to resign him.  However, he was not going to rouse him\nfrom his sleep.\n\n'Tell Mr. Heathcliff,' he answered calmly, 'that his son shall come to\nWuthering Heights to-morrow.  He is in bed, and too tired to go the\ndistance now.  You may also tell him that the mother of Linton desired\nhim to remain under my guardianship; and, at present, his health is very\nprecarious.'\n\n'Noa!' said Joseph, giving a thud with his prop on the floor, and\nassuming an authoritative air.  'Noa! that means naught.  Hathecliff maks\nnoa 'count o' t' mother, nor ye norther; but he'll heu' his lad; und I\nmun tak' him--soa now ye knaw!'\n\n'You shall not to-night!' answered Linton decisively.  'Walk down stairs\nat once, and repeat to your master what I have said.  Ellen, show him\ndown.  Go--'\n\nAnd, aiding the indignant elder with a lift by the arm, he rid the room\nof him and closed the door.\n\n'Varrah weell!' shouted Joseph, as he slowly drew off.  'To-morn, he's\ncome hisseln, and thrust _him_ out, if ye darr!'\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XX\n\n\nTo obviate the danger of this threat being fulfilled, Mr. Linton\ncommissioned me to take the boy home early, on Catherine's pony; and,\nsaid he--'As we shall now have no influence over his destiny, good or\nbad, you must say nothing of where he is gone to my daughter: she cannot\nassociate with him hereafter, and it is better for her to remain in\nignorance of his proximity; lest she should be restless, and anxious to\nvisit the Heights.  Merely tell her his father sent for him suddenly, and\nhe has been obliged to leave us.'\n\nLinton was very reluctant to be roused from his bed at five o'clock, and\nastonished to be informed that he must prepare for further travelling;\nbut I softened off the matter by stating that he was going to spend some\ntime with his father, Mr. Heathcliff, who wished to see him so much, he\ndid not like to defer the pleasure till he should recover from his late\njourney.\n\n'My father!' he cried, in strange perplexity.  'Mamma never told me I had\na father.  Where does he live?  I'd rather stay with uncle.'\n\n'He lives a little distance from the Grange,' I replied; 'just beyond\nthose hills: not so far, but you may walk over here when you get hearty.\nAnd you should be glad to go home, and to see him.  You must try to love\nhim, as you did your mother, and then he will love you.'\n\n'But why have I not heard of him before?' asked Linton.  'Why didn't\nmamma and he live together, as other people do?'\n\n'He had business to keep him in the north,' I answered, 'and your\nmother's health required her to reside in the south.'\n\n'And why didn't mamma speak to me about him?' persevered the child.  'She\noften talked of uncle, and I learnt to love him long ago.  How am I to\nlove papa?  I don't know him.'\n\n'Oh, all children love their parents,' I said.  'Your mother, perhaps,\nthought you would want to be with him if she mentioned him often to you.\nLet us make haste.  An early ride on such a beautiful morning is much\npreferable to an hour's more sleep.'\n\n'Is _she_ to go with us,' he demanded, 'the little girl I saw yesterday?'\n\n'Not now,' replied I.\n\n'Is uncle?' he continued.\n\n'No, I shall be your companion there,' I said.\n\nLinton sank back on his pillow and fell into a brown study.\n\n'I won't go without uncle,' he cried at length: 'I can't tell where you\nmean to take me.'\n\nI attempted to persuade him of the naughtiness of showing reluctance to\nmeet his father; still he obstinately resisted any progress towards\ndressing, and I had to call for my master's assistance in coaxing him out\nof bed.  The poor thing was finally got off, with several delusive\nassurances that his absence should be short: that Mr. Edgar and Cathy\nwould visit him, and other promises, equally ill-founded, which I\ninvented and reiterated at intervals throughout the way.  The pure\nheather-scented air, the bright sunshine, and the gentle canter of Minny,\nrelieved his despondency after a while.  He began to put questions\nconcerning his new home, and its inhabitants, with greater interest and\nliveliness.\n\n'Is Wuthering Heights as pleasant a place as Thrushcross Grange?' he\ninquired, turning to take a last glance into the valley, whence a light\nmist mounted and formed a fleecy cloud on the skirts of the blue.\n\n'It is not so buried in trees,' I replied, 'and it is not quite so large,\nbut you can see the country beautifully all round; and the air is\nhealthier for you--fresher and drier.  You will, perhaps, think the\nbuilding old and dark at first; though it is a respectable house: the\nnext best in the neighbourhood.  And you will have such nice rambles on\nthe moors.  Hareton Earnshaw--that is, Miss Cathy's other cousin, and so\nyours in a manner--will show you all the sweetest spots; and you can\nbring a book in fine weather, and make a green hollow your study; and,\nnow and then, your uncle may join you in a walk: he does, frequently,\nwalk out on the hills.'\n\n'And what is my father like?' he asked.  'Is he as young and handsome as\nuncle?'\n\n'He's as young,' said I; 'but he has black hair and eyes, and looks\nsterner; and he is taller and bigger altogether.  He'll not seem to you\nso gentle and kind at first, perhaps, because it is not his way: still,\nmind you, be frank and cordial with him; and naturally he'll be fonder of\nyou than any uncle, for you are his own.'\n\n'Black hair and eyes!' mused Linton.  'I can't fancy him.  Then I am not\nlike him, am I?'\n\n'Not much,' I answered: not a morsel, I thought, surveying with regret\nthe white complexion and slim frame of my companion, and his large\nlanguid eyes--his mother's eyes, save that, unless a morbid touchiness\nkindled them a moment, they had not a vestige of her sparkling spirit.\n\n'How strange that he should never come to see mamma and me!' he murmured.\n'Has he ever seen me?  If he has, I must have been a baby.  I remember\nnot a single thing about him!'\n\n'Why, Master Linton,' said I, 'three hundred miles is a great distance;\nand ten years seem very different in length to a grown-up person compared\nwith what they do to you.  It is probable Mr. Heathcliff proposed going\nfrom summer to summer, but never found a convenient opportunity; and now\nit is too late.  Don't trouble him with questions on the subject: it will\ndisturb him, for no good.'\n\nThe boy was fully occupied with his own cogitations for the remainder of\nthe ride, till we halted before the farmhouse garden-gate.  I watched to\ncatch his impressions in his countenance.  He surveyed the carved front\nand low-browed lattices, the straggling gooseberry-bushes and crooked\nfirs, with solemn intentness, and then shook his head: his private\nfeelings entirely disapproved of the exterior of his new abode.  But he\nhad sense to postpone complaining: there might be compensation within.\nBefore he dismounted, I went and opened the door.  It was half-past six;\nthe family had just finished breakfast: the servant was clearing and\nwiping down the table.  Joseph stood by his master's chair telling some\ntale concerning a lame horse; and Hareton was preparing for the hayfield.\n\n'Hallo, Nelly!' said Mr. Heathcliff, when he saw me.  'I feared I should\nhave to come down and fetch my property myself.  You've brought it, have\nyou?  Let us see what we can make of it.'\n\nHe got up and strode to the door: Hareton and Joseph followed in gaping\ncuriosity.  Poor Linton ran a frightened eye over the faces of the three.\n\n'Sure-ly,' said Joseph after a grave inspection, 'he's swopped wi' ye,\nMaister, an' yon's his lass!'\n\nHeathcliff, having stared his son into an ague of confusion, uttered a\nscornful laugh.\n\n'God! what a beauty! what a lovely, charming thing!' he exclaimed.\n'Hav'n't they reared it on snails and sour milk, Nelly?  Oh, damn my\nsoul! but that's worse than I expected--and the devil knows I was not\nsanguine!'\n\nI bid the trembling and bewildered child get down, and enter.  He did not\nthoroughly comprehend the meaning of his father's speech, or whether it\nwere intended for him: indeed, he was not yet certain that the grim,\nsneering stranger was his father.  But he clung to me with growing\ntrepidation; and on Mr. Heathcliff's taking a seat and bidding him 'come\nhither' he hid his face on my shoulder and wept.\n\n'Tut, tut!' said Heathcliff, stretching out a hand and dragging him\nroughly between his knees, and then holding up his head by the chin.\n'None of that nonsense!  We're not going to hurt thee, Linton--isn't that\nthy name?  Thou art thy mother's child, entirely!  Where is my share in\nthee, puling chicken?'\n\nHe took off the boy's cap and pushed back his thick flaxen curls, felt\nhis slender arms and his small fingers; during which examination Linton\nceased crying, and lifted his great blue eyes to inspect the inspector.\n\n'Do you know me?' asked Heathcliff, having satisfied himself that the\nlimbs were all equally frail and feeble.\n\n'No,' said Linton, with a gaze of vacant fear.\n\n'You've heard of me, I daresay?'\n\n'No,' he replied again.\n\n'No!  What a shame of your mother, never to waken your filial regard for\nme!  You are my son, then, I'll tell you; and your mother was a wicked\nslut to leave you in ignorance of the sort of father you possessed.  Now,\ndon't wince, and colour up!  Though it is something to see you have not\nwhite blood.  Be a good lad; and I'll do for you.  Nelly, if you be tired\nyou may sit down; if not, get home again.  I guess you'll report what you\nhear and see to the cipher at the Grange; and this thing won't be settled\nwhile you linger about it.'\n\n'Well,' replied I, 'I hope you'll be kind to the boy, Mr. Heathcliff, or\nyou'll not keep him long; and he's all you have akin in the wide world,\nthat you will ever know--remember.'\n\n'I'll be very kind to him, you needn't fear,' he said, laughing.  'Only\nnobody else must be kind to him: I'm jealous of monopolising his\naffection.  And, to begin my kindness, Joseph, bring the lad some\nbreakfast.  Hareton, you infernal calf, begone to your work.  Yes, Nell,'\nhe added, when they had departed, 'my son is prospective owner of your\nplace, and I should not wish him to die till I was certain of being his\nsuccessor.  Besides, he's _mine_, and I want the triumph of seeing _my_\ndescendant fairly lord of their estates; my child hiring their children\nto till their fathers' lands for wages.  That is the sole consideration\nwhich can make me endure the whelp: I despise him for himself, and hate\nhim for the memories he revives!  But that consideration is sufficient:\nhe's as safe with me, and shall be tended as carefully as your master\ntends his own.  I have a room up-stairs, furnished for him in handsome\nstyle; I've engaged a tutor, also, to come three times a week, from\ntwenty miles' distance, to teach him what he pleases to learn.  I've\nordered Hareton to obey him: and in fact I've arranged everything with a\nview to preserve the superior and the gentleman in him, above his\nassociates.  I do regret, however, that he so little deserves the\ntrouble: if I wished any blessing in the world, it was to find him a\nworthy object of pride; and I'm bitterly disappointed with the\nwhey-faced, whining wretch!'\n\nWhile he was speaking, Joseph returned bearing a basin of milk-porridge,\nand placed it before Linton: who stirred round the homely mess with a\nlook of aversion, and affirmed he could not eat it. I saw the old\nman-servant shared largely in his master's scorn of the child; though he\nwas compelled to retain the sentiment in his heart, because Heathcliff\nplainly meant his underlings to hold him in honour.\n\n'Cannot ate it?' repeated he, peering in Linton's face, and subduing his\nvoice to a whisper, for fear of being overheard.  'But Maister Hareton\nnivir ate naught else, when he wer a little 'un; and what wer gooid\nenough for him's gooid enough for ye, I's rayther think!'\n\n'I _sha'n't_ eat it!' answered Linton, snappishly.  'Take it away.'\n\nJoseph snatched up the food indignantly, and brought it to us.\n\n'Is there aught ails th' victuals?' he asked, thrusting the tray under\nHeathcliff's nose.\n\n'What should ail them?' he said.\n\n'Wah!' answered Joseph, 'yon dainty chap says he cannut ate 'em.  But I\nguess it's raight!  His mother wer just soa--we wer a'most too mucky to\nsow t' corn for makking her breead.'\n\n'Don't mention his mother to me,' said the master, angrily.  'Get him\nsomething that he can eat, that's all.  What is his usual food, Nelly?'\n\nI suggested boiled milk or tea; and the housekeeper received instructions\nto prepare some.  Come, I reflected, his father's selfishness may\ncontribute to his comfort.  He perceives his delicate constitution, and\nthe necessity of treating him tolerably.  I'll console Mr. Edgar by\nacquainting him with the turn Heathcliff's humour has taken.  Having no\nexcuse for lingering longer, I slipped out, while Linton was engaged in\ntimidly rebuffing the advances of a friendly sheep-dog.  But he was too\nmuch on the alert to be cheated: as I closed the door, I heard a cry, and\na frantic repetition of the words--\n\n'Don't leave me!  I'll not stay here!  I'll not stay here!'\n\nThen the latch was raised and fell: they did not suffer him to come\nforth.  I mounted Minny, and urged her to a trot; and so my brief\nguardianship ended.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXI\n\n\nWe had sad work with little Cathy that day: she rose in high glee, eager\nto join her cousin, and such passionate tears and lamentations followed\nthe news of his departure that Edgar himself was obliged to soothe her,\nby affirming he should come back soon: he added, however, 'if I can get\nhim'; and there were no hopes of that.  This promise poorly pacified her;\nbut time was more potent; and though still at intervals she inquired of\nher father when Linton would return, before she did see him again his\nfeatures had waxed so dim in her memory that she did not recognise him.\n\nWhen I chanced to encounter the housekeeper of Wuthering Heights, in\npaying business visits to Gimmerton, I used to ask how the young master\ngot on; for he lived almost as secluded as Catherine herself, and was\nnever to be seen.  I could gather from her that he continued in weak\nhealth, and was a tiresome inmate.  She said Mr. Heathcliff seemed to\ndislike him ever longer and worse, though he took some trouble to conceal\nit: he had an antipathy to the sound of his voice, and could not do at\nall with his sitting in the same room with him many minutes together.\nThere seldom passed much talk between them: Linton learnt his lessons and\nspent his evenings in a small apartment they called the parlour: or else\nlay in bed all day: for he was constantly getting coughs, and colds, and\naches, and pains of some sort.\n\n'And I never know such a fainthearted creature,' added the woman; 'nor\none so careful of hisseln. He _will_ go on, if I leave the window open a\nbit late in the evening. Oh! it's killing, a breath of night air! And he\nmust have a fire in the middle of summer; and Joseph's bacca-pipe is\npoison; and he must always have sweets and dainties, and always milk,\nmilk for ever--heeding naught how the rest of us are pinched in winter;\nand there he'll sit, wrapped in his furred cloak in his chair by the\nfire, with some toast and water or other slop on the hob to sip at; and\nif Hareton, for pity, comes to amuse him--Hareton is not bad-natured,\nthough he's rough--they're sure to part, one swearing and the other\ncrying. I believe the master would relish Earnshaw's thrashing him to a\nmummy, if he were not his son; and I'm certain he would be fit to turn\nhim out of doors, if he knew half the nursing he gives hisseln. But then\nhe won't go into danger of temptation: he never enters the parlour, and\nshould Linton show those ways in the house where he is, he sends him\nup-stairs directly.'\n\nI divined, from this account, that utter lack of sympathy had rendered\nyoung Heathcliff selfish and disagreeable, if he were not so originally;\nand my interest in him, consequently, decayed: though still I was moved\nwith a sense of grief at his lot, and a wish that he had been left with\nus.  Mr. Edgar encouraged me to gain information: he thought a great deal\nabout him, I fancy, and would have run some risk to see him; and he told\nme once to ask the housekeeper whether he ever came into the village?  She\nsaid he had only been twice, on horseback, accompanying his father; and\nboth times he pretended to be quite knocked up for three or four days\nafterwards.  That housekeeper left, if I recollect rightly, two years\nafter he came; and another, whom I did not know, was her successor; she\nlives there still.\n\nTime wore on at the Grange in its former pleasant way till Miss Cathy\nreached sixteen.  On the anniversary of her birth we never manifested any\nsigns of rejoicing, because it was also the anniversary of my late\nmistress's death.  Her father invariably spent that day alone in the\nlibrary; and walked, at dusk, as far as Gimmerton kirkyard, where he\nwould frequently prolong his stay beyond midnight.  Therefore Catherine\nwas thrown on her own resources for amusement.  This twentieth of March\nwas a beautiful spring day, and when her father had retired, my young\nlady came down dressed for going out, and said she asked to have a ramble\non the edge of the moor with me: Mr. Linton had given her leave, if we\nwent only a short distance and were back within the hour.\n\n'So make haste, Ellen!' she cried.  'I know where I wish to go; where a\ncolony of moor-game are settled: I want to see whether they have made\ntheir nests yet.'\n\n'That must be a good distance up,' I answered; 'they don't breed on the\nedge of the moor.'\n\n'No, it's not,' she said.  'I've gone very near with papa.'\n\nI put on my bonnet and sallied out, thinking nothing more of the matter.\nShe bounded before me, and returned to my side, and was off again like a\nyoung greyhound; and, at first, I found plenty of entertainment in\nlistening to the larks singing far and near, and enjoying the sweet, warm\nsunshine; and watching her, my pet and my delight, with her golden\nringlets flying loose behind, and her bright cheek, as soft and pure in\nits bloom as a wild rose, and her eyes radiant with cloudless pleasure.\nShe was a happy creature, and an angel, in those days.  It's a pity she\ncould not be content.\n\n'Well,' said I, 'where are your moor-game, Miss Cathy?  We should be at\nthem: the Grange park-fence is a great way off now.'\n\n'Oh, a little further--only a little further, Ellen,' was her answer,\ncontinually.  'Climb to that hillock, pass that bank, and by the time you\nreach the other side I shall have raised the birds.'\n\nBut there were so many hillocks and banks to climb and pass, that, at\nlength, I began to be weary, and told her we must halt, and retrace our\nsteps.  I shouted to her, as she had outstripped me a long way; she\neither did not hear or did not regard, for she still sprang on, and I was\ncompelled to follow.  Finally, she dived into a hollow; and before I came\nin sight of her again, she was two miles nearer Wuthering Heights than\nher own home; and I beheld a couple of persons arrest her, one of whom I\nfelt convinced was Mr. Heathcliff himself.\n\nCathy had been caught in the fact of plundering, or, at least, hunting\nout the nests of the grouse.  The Heights were Heathcliff's land, and he\nwas reproving the poacher.\n\n'I've neither taken any nor found any,' she said, as I toiled to them,\nexpanding her hands in corroboration of the statement.  'I didn't mean to\ntake them; but papa told me there were quantities up here, and I wished\nto see the eggs.'\n\nHeathcliff glanced at me with an ill-meaning smile, expressing his\nacquaintance with the party, and, consequently, his malevolence towards\nit, and demanded who 'papa' was?\n\n'Mr. Linton of Thrushcross Grange,' she replied.  'I thought you did not\nknow me, or you wouldn't have spoken in that way.'\n\n'You suppose papa is highly esteemed and respected, then?' he said,\nsarcastically.\n\n'And what are you?' inquired Catherine, gazing curiously on the speaker.\n'That man I've seen before.  Is he your son?'\n\nShe pointed to Hareton, the other individual, who had gained nothing but\nincreased bulk and strength by the addition of two years to his age: he\nseemed as awkward and rough as ever.\n\n'Miss Cathy,' I interrupted, 'it will be three hours instead of one that\nwe are out, presently.  We really must go back.'\n\n'No, that man is not my son,' answered Heathcliff, pushing me aside.  'But\nI have one, and you have seen him before too; and, though your nurse is\nin a hurry, I think both you and she would be the better for a little\nrest.  Will you just turn this nab of heath, and walk into my house?\nYou'll get home earlier for the ease; and you shall receive a kind\nwelcome.'\n\nI whispered Catherine that she mustn't, on any account, accede to the\nproposal: it was entirely out of the question.\n\n'Why?' she asked, aloud.  'I'm tired of running, and the ground is dewy:\nI can't sit here.  Let us go, Ellen.  Besides, he says I have seen his\nson.  He's mistaken, I think; but I guess where he lives: at the\nfarmhouse I visited in coming from Penistone Crags.  Don't you?'\n\n'I do.  Come, Nelly, hold your tongue--it will be a treat for her to look\nin on us.  Hareton, get forwards with the lass.  You shall walk with me,\nNelly.'\n\n'No, she's not going to any such place,' I cried, struggling to release\nmy arm, which he had seized: but she was almost at the door-stones\nalready, scampering round the brow at full speed.  Her appointed\ncompanion did not pretend to escort her: he shied off by the road-side,\nand vanished.\n\n'Mr. Heathcliff, it's very wrong,' I continued: 'you know you mean no\ngood.  And there she'll see Linton, and all will be told as soon as ever\nwe return; and I shall have the blame.'\n\n'I want her to see Linton,' he answered; 'he's looking better these few\ndays; it's not often he's fit to be seen.  And we'll soon persuade her to\nkeep the visit secret: where is the harm of it?'\n\n'The harm of it is, that her father would hate me if he found I suffered\nher to enter your house; and I am convinced you have a bad design in\nencouraging her to do so,' I replied.\n\n'My design is as honest as possible.  I'll inform you of its whole\nscope,' he said.  'That the two cousins may fall in love, and get\nmarried.  I'm acting generously to your master: his young chit has no\nexpectations, and should she second my wishes she'll be provided for at\nonce as joint successor with Linton.'\n\n'If Linton died,' I answered, 'and his life is quite uncertain, Catherine\nwould be the heir.'\n\n'No, she would not,' he said.  'There is no clause in the will to secure\nit so: his property would go to me; but, to prevent disputes, I desire\ntheir union, and am resolved to bring it about.'\n\n'And I'm resolved she shall never approach your house with me again,' I\nreturned, as we reached the gate, where Miss Cathy waited our coming.\n\nHeathcliff bade me be quiet; and, preceding us up the path, hastened to\nopen the door.  My young lady gave him several looks, as if she could not\nexactly make up her mind what to think of him; but now he smiled when he\nmet her eye, and softened his voice in addressing her; and I was foolish\nenough to imagine the memory of her mother might disarm him from desiring\nher injury.  Linton stood on the hearth.  He had been out walking in the\nfields, for his cap was on, and he was calling to Joseph to bring him dry\nshoes.  He had grown tall of his age, still wanting some months of\nsixteen.  His features were pretty yet, and his eye and complexion\nbrighter than I remembered them, though with merely temporary lustre\nborrowed from the salubrious air and genial sun.\n\n'Now, who is that?' asked Mr. Heathcliff, turning to Cathy.  'Can you\ntell?'\n\n'Your son?' she said, having doubtfully surveyed, first one and then the\nother.\n\n'Yes, yes,' answered he: 'but is this the only time you have beheld him?\nThink!  Ah! you have a short memory.  Linton, don't you recall your\ncousin, that you used to tease us so with wishing to see?'\n\n'What, Linton!' cried Cathy, kindling into joyful surprise at the name.\n'Is that little Linton?  He's taller than I am!  Are you Linton?'\n\nThe youth stepped forward, and acknowledged himself: she kissed him\nfervently, and they gazed with wonder at the change time had wrought in\nthe appearance of each.  Catherine had reached her full height; her\nfigure was both plump and slender, elastic as steel, and her whole aspect\nsparkling with health and spirits.  Linton's looks and movements were\nvery languid, and his form extremely slight; but there was a grace in his\nmanner that mitigated these defects, and rendered him not unpleasing.\nAfter exchanging numerous marks of fondness with him, his cousin went to\nMr. Heathcliff, who lingered by the door, dividing his attention between\nthe objects inside and those that lay without: pretending, that is, to\nobserve the latter, and really noting the former alone.\n\n'And you are my uncle, then!' she cried, reaching up to salute him.  'I\nthought I liked you, though you were cross at first.  Why don't you visit\nat the Grange with Linton?  To live all these years such close\nneighbours, and never see us, is odd: what have you done so for?'\n\n'I visited it once or twice too often before you were born,' he answered.\n'There--damn it!  If you have any kisses to spare, give them to Linton:\nthey are thrown away on me.'\n\n'Naughty Ellen!' exclaimed Catherine, flying to attack me next with her\nlavish caresses.  'Wicked Ellen! to try to hinder me from entering.  But\nI'll take this walk every morning in future: may I, uncle? and sometimes\nbring papa.  Won't you be glad to see us?'\n\n'Of course,' replied the uncle, with a hardly suppressed grimace,\nresulting from his deep aversion to both the proposed visitors.  'But\nstay,' he continued, turning towards the young lady.  'Now I think of it,\nI'd better tell you.  Mr. Linton has a prejudice against me: we\nquarrelled at one time of our lives, with unchristian ferocity; and, if\nyou mention coming here to him, he'll put a veto on your visits\naltogether.  Therefore, you must not mention it, unless you be careless\nof seeing your cousin hereafter: you may come, if you will, but you must\nnot mention it.'\n\n'Why did you quarrel?' asked Catherine, considerably crestfallen.\n\n'He thought me too poor to wed his sister,' answered Heathcliff, 'and was\ngrieved that I got her: his pride was hurt, and he'll never forgive it.'\n\n'That's wrong!' said the young lady: 'some time I'll tell him so.  But\nLinton and I have no share in your quarrel.  I'll not come here, then; he\nshall come to the Grange.'\n\n'It will be too far for me,' murmured her cousin: 'to walk four miles\nwould kill me.  No, come here, Miss Catherine, now and then: not every\nmorning, but once or twice a week.'\n\nThe father launched towards his son a glance of bitter contempt.\n\n'I am afraid, Nelly, I shall lose my labour,' he muttered to me.  'Miss\nCatherine, as the ninny calls her, will discover his value, and send him\nto the devil.  Now, if it had been Hareton!--Do you know that, twenty\ntimes a day, I covet Hareton, with all his degradation?  I'd have loved\nthe lad had he been some one else.  But I think he's safe from _her_\nlove.  I'll pit him against that paltry creature, unless it bestir itself\nbriskly.  We calculate it will scarcely last till it is eighteen.  Oh,\nconfound the vapid thing!  He's absorbed in drying his feet, and never\nlooks at her.--Linton!'\n\n'Yes, father,' answered the boy.\n\n'Have you nothing to show your cousin anywhere about, not even a rabbit\nor a weasel's nest?  Take her into the garden, before you change your\nshoes; and into the stable to see your horse.'\n\n'Wouldn't you rather sit here?' asked Linton, addressing Cathy in a tone\nwhich expressed reluctance to move again.\n\n'I don't know,' she replied, casting a longing look to the door, and\nevidently eager to be active.\n\nHe kept his seat, and shrank closer to the fire.  Heathcliff rose, and\nwent into the kitchen, and from thence to the yard, calling out for\nHareton.  Hareton responded, and presently the two re-entered.  The young\nman had been washing himself, as was visible by the glow on his cheeks\nand his wetted hair.\n\n'Oh, I'll ask _you_, uncle,' cried Miss Cathy, recollecting the\nhousekeeper's assertion.  'That is not my cousin, is he?'\n\n'Yes,' he, replied, 'your mother's nephew.  Don't you like him!'\n\nCatherine looked queer.\n\n'Is he not a handsome lad?' he continued.\n\nThe uncivil little thing stood on tiptoe, and whispered a sentence in\nHeathcliff's ear.  He laughed; Hareton darkened: I perceived he was very\nsensitive to suspected slights, and had obviously a dim notion of his\ninferiority.  But his master or guardian chased the frown by exclaiming--\n\n'You'll be the favourite among us, Hareton!  She says you are a--What was\nit?  Well, something very flattering.  Here! you go with her round the\nfarm.  And behave like a gentleman, mind!  Don't use any bad words; and\ndon't stare when the young lady is not looking at you, and be ready to\nhide your face when she is; and, when you speak, say your words slowly,\nand keep your hands out of your pockets.  Be off, and entertain her as\nnicely as you can.'\n\nHe watched the couple walking past the window.  Earnshaw had his\ncountenance completely averted from his companion.  He seemed studying\nthe familiar landscape with a stranger's and an artist's interest.\nCatherine took a sly look at him, expressing small admiration.  She then\nturned her attention to seeking out objects of amusement for herself, and\ntripped merrily on, lilting a tune to supply the lack of conversation.\n\n'I've tied his tongue,' observed Heathcliff.  'He'll not venture a single\nsyllable all the time!  Nelly, you recollect me at his age--nay, some\nyears younger.  Did I ever look so stupid: so \"gaumless,\" as Joseph calls\nit?'\n\n'Worse,' I replied, 'because more sullen with it.'\n\n'I've a pleasure in him,' he continued, reflecting aloud. 'He has\nsatisfied my expectations. If he were a born fool I should not enjoy it\nhalf so much. But he's no fool; and I can sympathise with all his\nfeelings, having felt them myself. I know what he suffers now, for\ninstance, exactly: it is merely a beginning of what he shall suffer,\nthough. And he'll never be able to emerge from his bathos of coarseness\nand ignorance. I've got him faster than his scoundrel of a father\nsecured me, and lower; for he takes a pride in his brutishness. I've\ntaught him to scorn everything extra-animal as silly and weak. Don't you\nthink Hindley would be proud of his son, if he could see him? almost as\nproud as I am of mine. But there's this difference; one is gold put to\nthe use of paving-stones, and the other is tin polished to ape a service\nof silver. _Mine_ has nothing valuable about it; yet I shall have the\nmerit of making it go as far as such poor stuff can go. _His_ had\nfirst-rate qualities, and they are lost: rendered worse than unavailing.\nI have nothing to regret; he would have more than any but I are aware\nof. And the best of it is, Hareton is damnably fond of me! You'll own\nthat I've outmatched Hindley there. If the dead villain could rise from\nhis grave to abuse me for his offspring's wrongs, I should have the fun\nof seeing the said offspring fight him back again, indignant that he\nshould dare to rail at the one friend he has in the world!'\n\nHeathcliff chuckled a fiendish laugh at the idea.  I made no reply,\nbecause I saw that he expected none.  Meantime, our young companion, who\nsat too removed from us to hear what was said, began to evince symptoms\nof uneasiness, probably repenting that he had denied himself the treat of\nCatherine's society for fear of a little fatigue.  His father remarked\nthe restless glances wandering to the window, and the hand irresolutely\nextended towards his cap.\n\n'Get up, you idle boy!' he exclaimed, with assumed heartiness.\n\n'Away after them! they are just at the corner, by the stand of hives.'\n\nLinton gathered his energies, and left the hearth.  The lattice was open,\nand, as he stepped out, I heard Cathy inquiring of her unsociable\nattendant what was that inscription over the door? Hareton stared up, and\nscratched his head like a true clown.\n\n'It's some damnable writing,' he answered.  'I cannot read it.'\n\n'Can't read it?' cried Catherine; 'I can read it: it's English.  But I\nwant to know why it is there.'\n\nLinton giggled: the first appearance of mirth he had exhibited.\n\n'He does not know his letters,' he said to his cousin.  'Could you\nbelieve in the existence of such a colossal dunce?'\n\n'Is he all as he should be?' asked Miss Cathy, seriously; 'or is he\nsimple: not right?  I've questioned him twice now, and each time he\nlooked so stupid I think he does not understand me.  I can hardly\nunderstand him, I'm sure!'\n\nLinton repeated his laugh, and glanced at Hareton tauntingly; who\ncertainly did not seem quite clear of comprehension at that moment.\n\n'There's nothing the matter but laziness; is there, Earnshaw?' he said.\n'My cousin fancies you are an idiot.  There you experience the\nconsequence of scorning \"book-larning,\" as you would say.  Have you\nnoticed, Catherine, his frightful Yorkshire pronunciation?'\n\n'Why, where the devil is the use on't?' growled Hareton, more ready in\nanswering his daily companion.  He was about to enlarge further, but the\ntwo youngsters broke into a noisy fit of merriment: my giddy miss being\ndelighted to discover that she might turn his strange talk to matter of\namusement.\n\n'Where is the use of the devil in that sentence?' tittered Linton.  'Papa\ntold you not to say any bad words, and you can't open your mouth without\none.  Do try to behave like a gentleman, now do!'\n\n'If thou weren't more a lass than a lad, I'd fell thee this minute, I\nwould; pitiful lath of a crater!' retorted the angry boor, retreating,\nwhile his face burnt with mingled rage and mortification! for he was\nconscious of being insulted, and embarrassed how to resent it.\n\nMr. Heathcliff having overheard the conversation, as well as I, smiled\nwhen he saw him go; but immediately afterwards cast a look of singular\naversion on the flippant pair, who remained chattering in the door-way:\nthe boy finding animation enough while discussing Hareton's faults and\ndeficiencies, and relating anecdotes of his goings on; and the girl\nrelishing his pert and spiteful sayings, without considering the\nill-nature they evinced.  I began to dislike, more than to compassionate\nLinton, and to excuse his father in some measure for holding him cheap.\n\nWe stayed till afternoon: I could not tear Miss Cathy away sooner; but\nhappily my master had not quitted his apartment, and remained ignorant of\nour prolonged absence.  As we walked home, I would fain have enlightened\nmy charge on the characters of the people we had quitted: but she got it\ninto her head that I was prejudiced against them.\n\n'Aha!' she cried, 'you take papa's side, Ellen: you are partial I know;\nor else you wouldn't have cheated me so many years into the notion that\nLinton lived a long way from here.  I'm really extremely angry; only I'm\nso pleased I can't show it!  But you must hold your tongue about _my_\nuncle; he's my uncle, remember; and I'll scold papa for quarrelling with\nhim.'\n\nAnd so she ran on, till I relinquished the endeavour to convince her of\nher mistake.  She did not mention the visit that night, because she did\nnot see Mr. Linton.  Next day it all came out, sadly to my chagrin; and\nstill I was not altogether sorry: I thought the burden of directing and\nwarning would be more efficiently borne by him than me.  But he was too\ntimid in giving satisfactory reasons for his wish that she should shun\nconnection with the household of the Heights, and Catherine liked good\nreasons for every restraint that harassed her petted will.\n\n'Papa!' she exclaimed, after the morning's salutations, 'guess whom I saw\nyesterday, in my walk on the moors.  Ah, papa, you started! you've not\ndone right, have you, now?  I saw--but listen, and you shall hear how I\nfound you out; and Ellen, who is in league with you, and yet pretended to\npity me so, when I kept hoping, and was always disappointed about\nLinton's coming back!'\n\nShe gave a faithful account of her excursion and its consequences; and my\nmaster, though he cast more than one reproachful look at me, said nothing\ntill she had concluded.  Then he drew her to him, and asked if she knew\nwhy he had concealed Linton's near neighbourhood from her?  Could she\nthink it was to deny her a pleasure that she might harmlessly enjoy?\n\n'It was because you disliked Mr. Heathcliff,' she answered.\n\n'Then you believe I care more for my own feelings than yours, Cathy?' he\nsaid.  'No, it was not because I disliked Mr. Heathcliff, but because Mr.\nHeathcliff dislikes me; and is a most diabolical man, delighting to wrong\nand ruin those he hates, if they give him the slightest opportunity.  I\nknew that you could not keep up an acquaintance with your cousin without\nbeing brought into contact with him; and I knew he would detest you on my\naccount; so for your own good, and nothing else, I took precautions that\nyou should not see Linton again.  I meant to explain this some time as\nyou grew older, and I'm sorry I delayed it.'\n\n'But Mr. Heathcliff was quite cordial, papa,' observed Catherine, not at\nall convinced; 'and he didn't object to our seeing each other: he said I\nmight come to his house when I pleased; only I must not tell you, because\nyou had quarrelled with him, and would not forgive him for marrying aunt\nIsabella.  And you won't.  _You_ are the one to be blamed: he is willing\nto let us be friends, at least; Linton and I; and you are not.'\n\nMy master, perceiving that she would not take his word for her\nuncle-in-law's evil disposition, gave a hasty sketch of his conduct to\nIsabella, and the manner in which Wuthering Heights became his property.\nHe could not bear to discourse long upon the topic; for though he spoke\nlittle of it, he still felt the same horror and detestation of his\nancient enemy that had occupied his heart ever since Mrs. Linton's\ndeath. 'She might have been living yet, if it had not been for him!' was\nhis constant bitter reflection; and, in his eyes, Heathcliff seemed a\nmurderer. Miss Cathy--conversant with no bad deeds except her own slight\nacts of disobedience, injustice, and passion, arising from hot temper\nand thoughtlessness, and repented of on the day they were committed--was\namazed at the blackness of spirit that could brood on and cover revenge\nfor years, and deliberately prosecute its plans without a visitation of\nremorse. She appeared so deeply impressed and shocked at this new view\nof human nature--excluded from all her studies and all her ideas till\nnow--that Mr. Edgar deemed it unnecessary to pursue the subject. He\nmerely added: 'You will know hereafter, darling, why I wish you to avoid\nhis house and family; now return to your old employments and amusements,\nand think no more about them.'\n\nCatherine kissed her father, and sat down quietly to her lessons for a\ncouple of hours, according to custom; then she accompanied him into the\ngrounds, and the whole day passed as usual: but in the evening, when she\nhad retired to her room, and I went to help her to undress, I found her\ncrying, on her knees by the bedside.\n\n'Oh, fie, silly child!' I exclaimed.  'If you had any real griefs you'd\nbe ashamed to waste a tear on this little contrariety.  You never had one\nshadow of substantial sorrow, Miss Catherine.  Suppose, for a minute,\nthat master and I were dead, and you were by yourself in the world: how\nwould you feel, then?  Compare the present occasion with such an\naffliction as that, and be thankful for the friends you have, instead of\ncoveting more.'\n\n'I'm not crying for myself, Ellen,' she answered, 'it's for him.  He\nexpected to see me again to-morrow, and there he'll be so disappointed:\nand he'll wait for me, and I sha'n't come!'\n\n'Nonsense!' said I, 'do you imagine he has thought as much of you as you\nhave of him?  Hasn't he Hareton for a companion?  Not one in a hundred\nwould weep at losing a relation they had just seen twice, for two\nafternoons.  Linton will conjecture how it is, and trouble himself no\nfurther about you.'\n\n'But may I not write a note to tell him why I cannot come?' she asked,\nrising to her feet.  'And just send those books I promised to lend him?\nHis books are not as nice as mine, and he wanted to have them extremely,\nwhen I told him how interesting they were.  May I not, Ellen?'\n\n'No, indeed! no, indeed!' replied I with decision.  'Then he would write\nto you, and there'd never be an end of it.  No, Miss Catherine, the\nacquaintance must be dropped entirely: so papa expects, and I shall see\nthat it is done.'\n\n'But how can one little note--?' she recommenced, putting on an imploring\ncountenance.\n\n'Silence!' I interrupted.  'We'll not begin with your little notes.  Get\ninto bed.'\n\nShe threw at me a very naughty look, so naughty that I would not kiss her\ngood-night at first: I covered her up, and shut her door, in great\ndispleasure; but, repenting half-way, I returned softly, and lo! there\nwas Miss standing at the table with a bit of blank paper before her and a\npencil in her hand, which she guiltily slipped out of sight on my\nentrance.\n\n'You'll get nobody to take that, Catherine,' I said, 'if you write it;\nand at present I shall put out your candle.'\n\nI set the extinguisher on the flame, receiving as I did so a slap on my\nhand and a petulant 'cross thing!'  I then quitted her again, and she\ndrew the bolt in one of her worst, most peevish humours.  The letter was\nfinished and forwarded to its destination by a milk-fetcher who came from\nthe village; but that I didn't learn till some time afterwards.  Weeks\npassed on, and Cathy recovered her temper; though she grew wondrous fond\nof stealing off to corners by herself and often, if I came near her\nsuddenly while reading, she would start and bend over the book, evidently\ndesirous to hide it; and I detected edges of loose paper sticking out\nbeyond the leaves.  She also got a trick of coming down early in the\nmorning and lingering about the kitchen, as if she were expecting the\narrival of something; and she had a small drawer in a cabinet in the\nlibrary, which she would trifle over for hours, and whose key she took\nspecial care to remove when she left it.\n\nOne day, as she inspected this drawer, I observed that the playthings and\ntrinkets which recently formed its contents were transmuted into bits of\nfolded paper.  My curiosity and suspicions were roused; I determined to\ntake a peep at her mysterious treasures; so, at night, as soon as she and\nmy master were safe upstairs, I searched, and readily found among my\nhouse keys one that would fit the lock.  Having opened, I emptied the\nwhole contents into my apron, and took them with me to examine at leisure\nin my own chamber.  Though I could not but suspect, I was still surprised\nto discover that they were a mass of correspondence--daily almost, it\nmust have been--from Linton Heathcliff: answers to documents forwarded by\nher.  The earlier dated were embarrassed and short; gradually, however,\nthey expanded into copious love-letters, foolish, as the age of the\nwriter rendered natural, yet with touches here and there which I thought\nwere borrowed from a more experienced source.  Some of them struck me as\nsingularly odd compounds of ardour and flatness; commencing in strong\nfeeling, and concluding in the affected, wordy style that a schoolboy\nmight use to a fancied, incorporeal sweetheart.  Whether they satisfied\nCathy I don't know; but they appeared very worthless trash to me.  After\nturning over as many as I thought proper, I tied them in a handkerchief\nand set them aside, relocking the vacant drawer.\n\nFollowing her habit, my young lady descended early, and visited the\nkitchen: I watched her go to the door, on the arrival of a certain little\nboy; and, while the dairymaid filled his can, she tucked something into\nhis jacket pocket, and plucked something out.  I went round by the\ngarden, and laid wait for the messenger; who fought valorously to defend\nhis trust, and we spilt the milk between us; but I succeeded in\nabstracting the epistle; and, threatening serious consequences if he did\nnot look sharp home, I remained under the wall and perused Miss Cathy's\naffectionate composition.  It was more simple and more eloquent than her\ncousin's: very pretty and very silly.  I shook my head, and went\nmeditating into the house.  The day being wet, she could not divert\nherself with rambling about the park; so, at the conclusion of her\nmorning studies, she resorted to the solace of the drawer.  Her father\nsat reading at the table; and I, on purpose, had sought a bit of work in\nsome unripped fringes of the window-curtain, keeping my eye steadily\nfixed on her proceedings.  Never did any bird flying back to a plundered\nnest, which it had left brimful of chirping young ones, express more\ncomplete despair, in its anguished cries and flutterings, than she by her\nsingle 'Oh!' and the change that transfigured her late happy countenance.\nMr. Linton looked up.\n\n'What is the matter, love?  Have you hurt yourself?' he said.\n\nHis tone and look assured her _he_ had not been the discoverer of the\nhoard.\n\n'No, papa!' she gasped.  'Ellen! Ellen! come up-stairs--I'm sick!'\n\nI obeyed her summons, and accompanied her out.\n\n'Oh, Ellen! you have got them,' she commenced immediately, dropping on\nher knees, when we were enclosed alone.  'Oh, give them to me, and I'll\nnever, never do so again!  Don't tell papa.  You have not told papa,\nEllen? say you have not?  I've been exceedingly naughty, but I won't do\nit any more!'\n\nWith a grave severity in my manner I bade her stand up.\n\n'So,' I exclaimed, 'Miss Catherine, you are tolerably far on, it seems:\nyou may well be ashamed of them!  A fine bundle of trash you study in\nyour leisure hours, to be sure: why, it's good enough to be printed!  And\nwhat do you suppose the master will think when I display it before him?  I\nhav'n't shown it yet, but you needn't imagine I shall keep your\nridiculous secrets.  For shame! and you must have led the way in writing\nsuch absurdities: he would not have thought of beginning, I'm certain.'\n\n'I didn't!  I didn't!' sobbed Cathy, fit to break her heart.  'I didn't\nonce think of loving him till--'\n\n'_Loving_!' cried I, as scornfully as I could utter the word.  '_Loving_!\nDid anybody ever hear the like!  I might just as well talk of loving the\nmiller who comes once a year to buy our corn.  Pretty loving, indeed! and\nboth times together you have seen Linton hardly four hours in your life!\nNow here is the babyish trash.  I'm going with it to the library; and\nwe'll see what your father says to such _loving_.'\n\nShe sprang at her precious epistles, but I held them above my head; and\nthen she poured out further frantic entreaties that I would burn them--do\nanything rather than show them.  And being really fully as much inclined\nto laugh as scold--for I esteemed it all girlish vanity--I at length\nrelented in a measure, and asked,--'If I consent to burn them, will you\npromise faithfully neither to send nor receive a letter again, nor a book\n(for I perceive you have sent him books), nor locks of hair, nor rings,\nnor playthings?'\n\n'We don't send playthings,' cried Catherine, her pride overcoming her\nshame.\n\n'Nor anything at all, then, my lady?' I said.  'Unless you will, here I\ngo.'\n\n'I promise, Ellen!' she cried, catching my dress.  'Oh, put them in the\nfire, do, do!'\n\nBut when I proceeded to open a place with the poker the sacrifice was too\npainful to be borne.  She earnestly supplicated that I would spare her\none or two.\n\n'One or two, Ellen, to keep for Linton's sake!'\n\nI unknotted the handkerchief, and commenced dropping them in from an\nangle, and the flame curled up the chimney.\n\n'I will have one, you cruel wretch!' she screamed, darting her hand into\nthe fire, and drawing forth some half-consumed fragments, at the expense\nof her fingers.\n\n'Very well--and I will have some to exhibit to papa!'  I answered,\nshaking back the rest into the bundle, and turning anew to the door.\n\nShe emptied her blackened pieces into the flames, and motioned me to\nfinish the immolation.  It was done; I stirred up the ashes, and interred\nthem under a shovelful of coals; and she mutely, and with a sense of\nintense injury, retired to her private apartment.  I descended to tell my\nmaster that the young lady's qualm of sickness was almost gone, but I\njudged it best for her to lie down a while.  She wouldn't dine; but she\nreappeared at tea, pale, and red about the eyes, and marvellously subdued\nin outward aspect.  Next morning I answered the letter by a slip of\npaper, inscribed, 'Master Heathcliff is requested to send no more notes\nto Miss Linton, as she will not receive them.'  And, henceforth, the\nlittle boy came with vacant pockets.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXII\n\n\nSummer drew to an end, and early autumn: it was past Michaelmas, but the\nharvest was late that year, and a few of our fields were still uncleared.\nMr. Linton and his daughter would frequently walk out among the reapers;\nat the carrying of the last sheaves they stayed till dusk, and the\nevening happening to be chill and damp, my master caught a bad cold, that\nsettled obstinately on his lungs, and confined him indoors throughout the\nwhole of the winter, nearly without intermission.\n\nPoor Cathy, frightened from her little romance, had been considerably\nsadder and duller since its abandonment; and her father insisted on her\nreading less, and taking more exercise.  She had his companionship no\nlonger; I esteemed it a duty to supply its lack, as much as possible,\nwith mine: an inefficient substitute; for I could only spare two or three\nhours, from my numerous diurnal occupations, to follow her footsteps, and\nthen my society was obviously less desirable than his.\n\nOn an afternoon in October, or the beginning of November--a fresh watery\nafternoon, when the turf and paths were rustling with moist, withered\nleaves, and the cold blue sky was half hidden by clouds--dark grey\nstreamers, rapidly mounting from the west, and boding abundant rain--I\nrequested my young lady to forego her ramble, because I was certain of\nshowers.  She refused; and I unwillingly donned a cloak, and took my\numbrella to accompany her on a stroll to the bottom of the park: a formal\nwalk which she generally affected if low-spirited--and that she\ninvariably was when Mr. Edgar had been worse than ordinary, a thing never\nknown from his confession, but guessed both by her and me from his\nincreased silence and the melancholy of his countenance.  She went sadly\non: there was no running or bounding now, though the chill wind might\nwell have tempted her to race.  And often, from the side of my eye, I\ncould detect her raising a hand, and brushing something off her cheek.  I\ngazed round for a means of diverting her thoughts.  On one side of the\nroad rose a high, rough bank, where hazels and stunted oaks, with their\nroots half exposed, held uncertain tenure: the soil was too loose for the\nlatter; and strong winds had blown some nearly horizontal.  In summer\nMiss Catherine delighted to climb along these trunks, and sit in the\nbranches, swinging twenty feet above the ground; and I, pleased with her\nagility and her light, childish heart, still considered it proper to\nscold every time I caught her at such an elevation, but so that she knew\nthere was no necessity for descending.  From dinner to tea she would lie\nin her breeze-rocked cradle, doing nothing except singing old songs--my\nnursery lore--to herself, or watching the birds, joint tenants, feed and\nentice their young ones to fly: or nestling with closed lids, half\nthinking, half dreaming, happier than words can express.\n\n'Look, Miss!' I exclaimed, pointing to a nook under the roots of one\ntwisted tree.  'Winter is not here yet.  There's a little flower up\nyonder, the last bud from the multitude of bluebells that clouded those\nturf steps in July with a lilac mist.  Will you clamber up, and pluck it\nto show to papa?'  Cathy stared a long time at the lonely blossom\ntrembling in its earthy shelter, and replied, at length--'No, I'll not\ntouch it: but it looks melancholy, does it not, Ellen?'\n\n'Yes,' I observed, 'about as starved and suckless as you: your cheeks are\nbloodless; let us take hold of hands and run.  You're so low, I daresay I\nshall keep up with you.'\n\n'No,' she repeated, and continued sauntering on, pausing at intervals to\nmuse over a bit of moss, or a tuft of blanched grass, or a fungus\nspreading its bright orange among the heaps of brown foliage; and, ever\nand anon, her hand was lifted to her averted face.\n\n'Catherine, why are you crying, love?' I asked, approaching and putting\nmy arm over her shoulder.  'You mustn't cry because papa has a cold; be\nthankful it is nothing worse.'\n\nShe now put no further restraint on her tears; her breath was stifled by\nsobs.\n\n'Oh, it will be something worse,' she said.  'And what shall I do when\npapa and you leave me, and I am by myself?  I can't forget your words,\nEllen; they are always in my ear.  How life will be changed, how dreary\nthe world will be, when papa and you are dead.'\n\n'None can tell whether you won't die before us,' I replied.  'It's wrong\nto anticipate evil.  We'll hope there are years and years to come before\nany of us go: master is young, and I am strong, and hardly forty-five.  My\nmother lived till eighty, a canty dame to the last.  And suppose Mr.\nLinton were spared till he saw sixty, that would be more years than you\nhave counted, Miss.  And would it not be foolish to mourn a calamity\nabove twenty years beforehand?'\n\n'But Aunt Isabella was younger than papa,' she remarked, gazing up with\ntimid hope to seek further consolation.\n\n'Aunt Isabella had not you and me to nurse her,' I replied.  'She wasn't\nas happy as Master: she hadn't as much to live for.  All you need do, is\nto wait well on your father, and cheer him by letting him see you\ncheerful; and avoid giving him anxiety on any subject: mind that, Cathy!\nI'll not disguise but you might kill him if you were wild and reckless,\nand cherished a foolish, fanciful affection for the son of a person who\nwould be glad to have him in his grave; and allowed him to discover that\nyou fretted over the separation he has judged it expedient to make.'\n\n'I fret about nothing on earth except papa's illness,' answered my\ncompanion.  'I care for nothing in comparison with papa.  And I'll\nnever--never--oh, never, while I have my senses, do an act or say a word\nto vex him.  I love him better than myself, Ellen; and I know it by this:\nI pray every night that I may live after him; because I would rather be\nmiserable than that he should be: that proves I love him better than\nmyself.'\n\n'Good words,' I replied.  'But deeds must prove it also; and after he is\nwell, remember you don't forget resolutions formed in the hour of fear.'\n\nAs we talked, we neared a door that opened on the road; and my young\nlady, lightening into sunshine again, climbed up and seated herself on\nthe top of the wall, reaching over to gather some hips that bloomed\nscarlet on the summit branches of the wild-rose trees shadowing the\nhighway side: the lower fruit had disappeared, but only birds could touch\nthe upper, except from Cathy's present station.  In stretching to pull\nthem, her hat fell off; and as the door was locked, she proposed\nscrambling down to recover it.  I bid her be cautious lest she got a\nfall, and she nimbly disappeared.  But the return was no such easy\nmatter: the stones were smooth and neatly cemented, and the rose-bushes\nand black-berry stragglers could yield no assistance in re-ascending.  I,\nlike a fool, didn't recollect that, till I heard her laughing and\nexclaiming--'Ellen! you'll have to fetch the key, or else I must run\nround to the porter's lodge.  I can't scale the ramparts on this side!'\n\n'Stay where you are,' I answered; 'I have my bundle of keys in my pocket:\nperhaps I may manage to open it; if not, I'll go.'\n\nCatherine amused herself with dancing to and fro before the door, while I\ntried all the large keys in succession.  I had applied the last, and\nfound that none would do; so, repeating my desire that she would remain\nthere, I was about to hurry home as fast as I could, when an approaching\nsound arrested me.  It was the trot of a horse; Cathy's dance stopped\nalso.\n\n'Who is that?' I whispered.\n\n'Ellen, I wish you could open the door,' whispered back my companion,\nanxiously.\n\n'Ho, Miss Linton!' cried a deep voice (the rider's), 'I'm glad to meet\nyou.  Don't be in haste to enter, for I have an explanation to ask and\nobtain.'\n\n'I sha'n't speak to you, Mr. Heathcliff,' answered Catherine.  'Papa says\nyou are a wicked man, and you hate both him and me; and Ellen says the\nsame.'\n\n'That is nothing to the purpose,' said Heathcliff.  (He it was.)  'I\ndon't hate my son, I suppose; and it is concerning him that I demand your\nattention.  Yes; you have cause to blush.  Two or three months since,\nwere you not in the habit of writing to Linton? making love in play, eh?\nYou deserved, both of you, flogging for that!  You especially, the elder;\nand less sensitive, as it turns out.  I've got your letters, and if you\ngive me any pertness I'll send them to your father.  I presume you grew\nweary of the amusement and dropped it, didn't you?  Well, you dropped\nLinton with it into a Slough of Despond.  He was in earnest: in love,\nreally.  As true as I live, he's dying for you; breaking his heart at\nyour fickleness: not figuratively, but actually.  Though Hareton has made\nhim a standing jest for six weeks, and I have used more serious measures,\nand attempted to frighten him out of his idiotcy, he gets worse daily;\nand he'll be under the sod before summer, unless you restore him!'\n\n'How can you lie so glaringly to the poor child?' I called from the\ninside.  'Pray ride on!  How can you deliberately get up such paltry\nfalsehoods?  Miss Cathy, I'll knock the lock off with a stone: you won't\nbelieve that vile nonsense.  You can feel in yourself it is impossible\nthat a person should die for love of a stranger.'\n\n'I was not aware there were eavesdroppers,' muttered the detected\nvillain. 'Worthy Mrs. Dean, I like you, but I don't like your\ndouble-dealing,' he added aloud. 'How could _you_ lie so glaringly as to\naffirm I hated the \"poor child\"? and invent bugbear stories to terrify\nher from my door-stones? Catherine Linton (the very name warms me), my\nbonny lass, I shall be from home all this week; go and see if have not\nspoken truth: do, there's a darling! Just imagine your father in my\nplace, and Linton in yours; then think how you would value your careless\nlover if he refused to stir a step to comfort you, when your father\nhimself entreated him; and don't, from pure stupidity, fall into the\nsame error. I swear, on my salvation, he's going to his grave, and none\nbut you can save him!'\n\nThe lock gave way and I issued out.\n\n'I swear Linton is dying,' repeated Heathcliff, looking hard at me.  'And\ngrief and disappointment are hastening his death.  Nelly, if you won't\nlet her go, you can walk over yourself.  But I shall not return till this\ntime next week; and I think your master himself would scarcely object to\nher visiting her cousin.'\n\n'Come in,' said I, taking Cathy by the arm and half forcing her to\nre-enter; for she lingered, viewing with troubled eyes the features of\nthe speaker, too stern to express his inward deceit.\n\nHe pushed his horse close, and, bending down, observed--'Miss Catherine,\nI'll own to you that I have little patience with Linton; and Hareton and\nJoseph have less.  I'll own that he's with a harsh set.  He pines for\nkindness, as well as love; and a kind word from you would be his best\nmedicine.  Don't mind Mrs. Dean's cruel cautions; but be generous, and\ncontrive to see him.  He dreams of you day and night, and cannot be\npersuaded that you don't hate him, since you neither write nor call.'\n\nI closed the door, and rolled a stone to assist the loosened lock in\nholding it; and spreading my umbrella, I drew my charge underneath: for\nthe rain began to drive through the moaning branches of the trees, and\nwarned us to avoid delay.  Our hurry prevented any comment on the\nencounter with Heathcliff, as we stretched towards home; but I divined\ninstinctively that Catherine's heart was clouded now in double darkness.\nHer features were so sad, they did not seem hers: she evidently regarded\nwhat she had heard as every syllable true.\n\nThe master had retired to rest before we came in.  Cathy stole to his\nroom to inquire how he was; he had fallen asleep.  She returned, and\nasked me to sit with her in the library.  We took our tea together; and\nafterwards she lay down on the rug, and told me not to talk, for she was\nweary.  I got a book, and pretended to read.  As soon as she supposed me\nabsorbed in my occupation, she recommenced her silent weeping: it\nappeared, at present, her favourite diversion.  I suffered her to enjoy\nit a while; then I expostulated: deriding and ridiculing all Mr.\nHeathcliff's assertions about his son, as if I were certain she would\ncoincide.  Alas!  I hadn't skill to counteract the effect his account had\nproduced: it was just what he intended.\n\n'You may be right, Ellen,' she answered; 'but I shall never feel at ease\ntill I know.  And I must tell Linton it is not my fault that I don't\nwrite, and convince him that I shall not change.'\n\nWhat use were anger and protestations against her silly credulity?  We\nparted that night--hostile; but next day beheld me on the road to\nWuthering Heights, by the side of my wilful young mistress's pony.  I\ncouldn't bear to witness her sorrow: to see her pale, dejected\ncountenance, and heavy eyes: and I yielded, in the faint hope that Linton\nhimself might prove, by his reception of us, how little of the tale was\nfounded on fact.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIII\n\n\nThe rainy night had ushered in a misty morning--half frost, half\ndrizzle--and temporary brooks crossed our path--gurgling from the\nuplands.  My feet were thoroughly wetted; I was cross and low; exactly\nthe humour suited for making the most of these disagreeable things.  We\nentered the farm-house by the kitchen way, to ascertain whether Mr.\nHeathcliff were really absent: because I put slight faith in his own\naffirmation.\n\nJoseph seemed sitting in a sort of elysium alone, beside a roaring fire;\na quart of ale on the table near him, bristling with large pieces of\ntoasted oat-cake; and his black, short pipe in his mouth.  Catherine ran\nto the hearth to warm herself.  I asked if the master was in?  My\nquestion remained so long unanswered, that I thought the old man had\ngrown deaf, and repeated it louder.\n\n'Na--ay!' he snarled, or rather screamed through his nose.  'Na--ay! yah\nmuh goa back whear yah coom frough.'\n\n'Joseph!' cried a peevish voice, simultaneously with me, from the inner\nroom.  'How often am I to call you?  There are only a few red ashes now.\nJoseph! come this moment.'\n\nVigorous puffs, and a resolute stare into the grate, declared he had no\near for this appeal.  The housekeeper and Hareton were invisible; one\ngone on an errand, and the other at his work, probably.  We knew Linton's\ntones, and entered.\n\n'Oh, I hope you'll die in a garret, starved to death!' said the boy,\nmistaking our approach for that of his negligent attendant.\n\nHe stopped on observing his error: his cousin flew to him.\n\n'Is that you, Miss Linton?' he said, raising his head from the arm of the\ngreat chair, in which he reclined.  'No--don't kiss me: it takes my\nbreath.  Dear me!  Papa said you would call,' continued he, after\nrecovering a little from Catherine's embrace; while she stood by looking\nvery contrite.  'Will you shut the door, if you please? you left it open;\nand those--those _detestable_ creatures won't bring coals to the fire.\nIt's so cold!'\n\nI stirred up the cinders, and fetched a scuttleful myself.  The invalid\ncomplained of being covered with ashes; but he had a tiresome cough, and\nlooked feverish and ill, so I did not rebuke his temper.\n\n'Well, Linton,' murmured Catherine, when his corrugated brow relaxed,\n'are you glad to see me?  Can I do you any good?'\n\n'Why didn't you come before?' he asked.  'You should have come, instead\nof writing.  It tired me dreadfully writing those long letters.  I'd far\nrather have talked to you.  Now, I can neither bear to talk, nor anything\nelse.  I wonder where Zillah is!  Will you' (looking at me) 'step into\nthe kitchen and see?'\n\nI had received no thanks for my other service; and being unwilling to run\nto and fro at his behest, I replied--'Nobody is out there but Joseph.'\n\n'I want to drink,' he exclaimed fretfully, turning away.  'Zillah is\nconstantly gadding off to Gimmerton since papa went: it's miserable!  And\nI'm obliged to come down here--they resolved never to hear me up-stairs.'\n\n'Is your father attentive to you, Master Heathcliff?' I asked, perceiving\nCatherine to be checked in her friendly advances.\n\n'Attentive?  He makes them a little more attentive at least,' he cried.\n'The wretches!  Do you know, Miss Linton, that brute Hareton laughs at\nme!  I hate him! indeed, I hate them all: they are odious beings.'\n\nCathy began searching for some water; she lighted on a pitcher in the\ndresser, filled a tumbler, and brought it.  He bid her add a spoonful of\nwine from a bottle on the table; and having swallowed a small portion,\nappeared more tranquil, and said she was very kind.\n\n'And are you glad to see me?' asked she, reiterating her former question\nand pleased to detect the faint dawn of a smile.\n\n'Yes, I am.  It's something new to hear a voice like yours!' he replied.\n'But I have been vexed, because you wouldn't come.  And papa swore it was\nowing to me: he called me a pitiful, shuffling, worthless thing; and said\nyou despised me; and if he had been in my place, he would be more the\nmaster of the Grange than your father by this time.  But you don't\ndespise me, do you, Miss--?'\n\n'I wish you would say Catherine, or Cathy,' interrupted my young lady.\n'Despise you?  No!  Next to papa and Ellen, I love you better than\nanybody living.  I don't love Mr. Heathcliff, though; and I dare not come\nwhen he returns: will he stay away many days?'\n\n'Not many,' answered Linton; 'but he goes on to the moors frequently,\nsince the shooting season commenced; and you might spend an hour or two\nwith me in his absence.  Do say you will.  I think I should not be\npeevish with you: you'd not provoke me, and you'd always be ready to help\nme, wouldn't you?'\n\n'Yes,' said Catherine, stroking his long soft hair: 'if I could only get\npapa's consent, I'd spend half my time with you.  Pretty Linton!  I wish\nyou were my brother.'\n\n'And then you would like me as well as your father?' observed he, more\ncheerfully.  'But papa says you would love me better than him and all the\nworld, if you were my wife; so I'd rather you were that.'\n\n'No, I should never love anybody better than papa,' she returned gravely.\n'And people hate their wives, sometimes; but not their sisters and\nbrothers: and if you were the latter, you would live with us, and papa\nwould be as fond of you as he is of me.'\n\nLinton denied that people ever hated their wives; but Cathy affirmed they\ndid, and, in her wisdom, instanced his own father's aversion to her aunt.\nI endeavoured to stop her thoughtless tongue.  I couldn't succeed till\neverything she knew was out.  Master Heathcliff, much irritated, asserted\nher relation was false.\n\n'Papa told me; and papa does not tell falsehoods,' she answered pertly.\n\n'_My_ papa scorns yours!' cried Linton.  'He calls him a sneaking fool.'\n\n'Yours is a wicked man,' retorted Catherine; 'and you are very naughty to\ndare to repeat what he says.  He must be wicked to have made Aunt\nIsabella leave him as she did.'\n\n'She didn't leave him,' said the boy; 'you sha'n't contradict me.'\n\n'She did,' cried my young lady.\n\n'Well, I'll tell you something!' said Linton.  'Your mother hated your\nfather: now then.'\n\n'Oh!' exclaimed Catherine, too enraged to continue.\n\n'And she loved mine,' added he.\n\n'You little liar!  I hate you now!' she panted, and her face grew red\nwith passion.\n\n'She did! she did!' sang Linton, sinking into the recess of his chair,\nand leaning back his head to enjoy the agitation of the other disputant,\nwho stood behind.\n\n'Hush, Master Heathcliff!' I said; 'that's your father's tale, too, I\nsuppose.'\n\n'It isn't: you hold your tongue!' he answered.  'She did, she did,\nCatherine! she did, she did!'\n\nCathy, beside herself, gave the chair a violent push, and caused him to\nfall against one arm.  He was immediately seized by a suffocating cough\nthat soon ended his triumph.  It lasted so long that it frightened even\nme.  As to his cousin, she wept with all her might, aghast at the\nmischief she had done: though she said nothing.  I held him till the fit\nexhausted itself.  Then he thrust me away, and leant his head down\nsilently.  Catherine quelled her lamentations also, took a seat opposite,\nand looked solemnly into the fire.\n\n'How do you feel now, Master Heathcliff?' I inquired, after waiting ten\nminutes.\n\n'I wish _she_ felt as I do,' he replied: 'spiteful, cruel thing! Hareton\nnever touches me: he never struck me in his life. And I was better\nto-day: and there--' his voice died in a whimper.\n\n'_I_ didn't strike you!' muttered Cathy, chewing her lip to prevent\nanother burst of emotion.\n\nHe sighed and moaned like one under great suffering, and kept it up for a\nquarter of an hour; on purpose to distress his cousin apparently, for\nwhenever he caught a stifled sob from her he put renewed pain and pathos\ninto the inflexions of his voice.\n\n'I'm sorry I hurt you, Linton,' she said at length, racked beyond\nendurance.  'But I couldn't have been hurt by that little push, and I had\nno idea that you could, either: you're not much, are you, Linton?  Don't\nlet me go home thinking I've done you harm.  Answer! speak to me.'\n\n'I can't speak to you,' he murmured; 'you've hurt me so that I shall lie\nawake all night choking with this cough.  If you had it you'd know what\nit was; but _you'll_ be comfortably asleep while I'm in agony, and nobody\nnear me.  I wonder how you would like to pass those fearful nights!'  And\nhe began to wail aloud, for very pity of himself.\n\n'Since you are in the habit of passing dreadful nights,' I said, 'it\nwon't be Miss who spoils your ease: you'd be the same had she never come.\nHowever, she shall not disturb you again; and perhaps you'll get quieter\nwhen we leave you.'\n\n'Must I go?' asked Catherine dolefully, bending over him.  'Do you want\nme to go, Linton?'\n\n'You can't alter what you've done,' he replied pettishly, shrinking from\nher, 'unless you alter it for the worse by teasing me into a fever.'\n\n'Well, then, I must go?' she repeated.\n\n'Let me alone, at least,' said he; 'I can't bear your talking.'\n\nShe lingered, and resisted my persuasions to departure a tiresome while;\nbut as he neither looked up nor spoke, she finally made a movement to the\ndoor, and I followed.  We were recalled by a scream.  Linton had slid\nfrom his seat on to the hearthstone, and lay writhing in the mere\nperverseness of an indulged plague of a child, determined to be as\ngrievous and harassing as it can.  I thoroughly gauged his disposition\nfrom his behaviour, and saw at once it would be folly to attempt\nhumouring him.  Not so my companion: she ran back in terror, knelt down,\nand cried, and soothed, and entreated, till he grew quiet from lack of\nbreath: by no means from compunction at distressing her.\n\n'I shall lift him on to the settle,' I said, 'and he may roll about as he\npleases: we can't stop to watch him.  I hope you are satisfied, Miss\nCathy, that you are not the person to benefit him; and that his condition\nof health is not occasioned by attachment to you.  Now, then, there he\nis!  Come away: as soon as he knows there is nobody by to care for his\nnonsense, he'll be glad to lie still.'\n\nShe placed a cushion under his head, and offered him some water; he\nrejected the latter, and tossed uneasily on the former, as if it were a\nstone or a block of wood.  She tried to put it more comfortably.\n\n'I can't do with that,' he said; 'it's not high enough.'\n\nCatherine brought another to lay above it.\n\n'That's too high,' murmured the provoking thing.\n\n'How must I arrange it, then?' she asked despairingly.\n\nHe twined himself up to her, as she half knelt by the settle, and\nconverted her shoulder into a support.\n\n'No, that won't do,' I said.  'You'll be content with the cushion, Master\nHeathcliff.  Miss has wasted too much time on you already: we cannot\nremain five minutes longer.'\n\n'Yes, yes, we can!' replied Cathy.  'He's good and patient now.  He's\nbeginning to think I shall have far greater misery than he will to-night,\nif I believe he is the worse for my visit: and then I dare not come\nagain.  Tell the truth about it, Linton; for I musn't come, if I have\nhurt you.'\n\n'You must come, to cure me,' he answered.  'You ought to come, because\nyou have hurt me: you know you have extremely!  I was not as ill when you\nentered as I am at present--was I?'\n\n'But you've made yourself ill by crying and being in a passion.--I didn't\ndo it all,' said his cousin.  'However, we'll be friends now.  And you\nwant me: you would wish to see me sometimes, really?'\n\n'I told you I did,' he replied impatiently.  'Sit on the settle and let\nme lean on your knee.  That's as mamma used to do, whole afternoons\ntogether.  Sit quite still and don't talk: but you may sing a song, if\nyou can sing; or you may say a nice long interesting ballad--one of those\nyou promised to teach me; or a story.  I'd rather have a ballad, though:\nbegin.'\n\nCatherine repeated the longest she could remember.  The employment\npleased both mightily.  Linton would have another, and after that\nanother, notwithstanding my strenuous objections; and so they went on\nuntil the clock struck twelve, and we heard Hareton in the court,\nreturning for his dinner.\n\n'And to-morrow, Catherine, will you be here to-morrow?' asked young\nHeathcliff, holding her frock as she rose reluctantly.\n\n'No,' I answered, 'nor next day neither.'  She, however, gave a different\nresponse evidently, for his forehead cleared as she stooped and whispered\nin his ear.\n\n'You won't go to-morrow, recollect, Miss!' I commenced, when we were out\nof the house.  'You are not dreaming of it, are you?'\n\nShe smiled.\n\n'Oh, I'll take good care,' I continued: 'I'll have that lock mended, and\nyou can escape by no way else.'\n\n'I can get over the wall,' she said laughing.  'The Grange is not a\nprison, Ellen, and you are not my gaoler.  And besides, I'm almost\nseventeen: I'm a woman.  And I'm certain Linton would recover quickly if\nhe had me to look after him.  I'm older than he is, you know, and wiser:\nless childish, am I not?  And he'll soon do as I direct him, with some\nslight coaxing.  He's a pretty little darling when he's good.  I'd make\nsuch a pet of him, if he were mine.  We should never quarrel, should we\nafter we were used to each other?  Don't you like him, Ellen?'\n\n'Like him!' I exclaimed.  'The worst-tempered bit of a sickly slip that\never struggled into its teens.  Happily, as Mr. Heathcliff conjectured,\nhe'll not win twenty.  I doubt whether he'll see spring, indeed.  And\nsmall loss to his family whenever he drops off.  And lucky it is for us\nthat his father took him: the kinder he was treated, the more tedious and\nselfish he'd be.  I'm glad you have no chance of having him for a\nhusband, Miss Catherine.'\n\nMy companion waxed serious at hearing this speech.  To speak of his death\nso regardlessly wounded her feelings.\n\n'He's younger than I,' she answered, after a protracted pause of\nmeditation, 'and he ought to live the longest: he will--he must live as\nlong as I do.  He's as strong now as when he first came into the north;\nI'm positive of that.  It's only a cold that ails him, the same as papa\nhas.  You say papa will get better, and why shouldn't he?'\n\n'Well, well,' I cried, 'after all, we needn't trouble ourselves; for\nlisten, Miss,--and mind, I'll keep my word,--if you attempt going to\nWuthering Heights again, with or without me, I shall inform Mr. Linton,\nand, unless he allow it, the intimacy with your cousin must not be\nrevived.'\n\n'It has been revived,' muttered Cathy, sulkily.\n\n'Must not be continued, then,' I said.\n\n'We'll see,' was her reply, and she set off at a gallop, leaving me to\ntoil in the rear.\n\nWe both reached home before our dinner-time; my master supposed we had\nbeen wandering through the park, and therefore he demanded no explanation\nof our absence.  As soon as I entered I hastened to change my soaked\nshoes and stockings; but sitting such awhile at the Heights had done the\nmischief.  On the succeeding morning I was laid up, and during three\nweeks I remained incapacitated for attending to my duties: a calamity\nnever experienced prior to that period, and never, I am thankful to say,\nsince.\n\nMy little mistress behaved like an angel in coming to wait on me, and\ncheer my solitude; the confinement brought me exceedingly low.  It is\nwearisome, to a stirring active body: but few have slighter reasons for\ncomplaint than I had.  The moment Catherine left Mr. Linton's room she\nappeared at my bedside.  Her day was divided between us; no amusement\nusurped a minute: she neglected her meals, her studies, and her play; and\nshe was the fondest nurse that ever watched.  She must have had a warm\nheart, when she loved her father so, to give so much to me.  I said her\ndays were divided between us; but the master retired early, and I\ngenerally needed nothing after six o'clock, thus the evening was her own.\nPoor thing!  I never considered what she did with herself after tea.  And\nthough frequently, when she looked in to bid me good-night, I remarked a\nfresh colour in her cheeks and a pinkness over her slender fingers,\ninstead of fancying the line borrowed from a cold ride across the moors,\nI laid it to the charge of a hot fire in the library.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIV\n\n\nAt the close of three weeks I was able to quit my chamber and move about\nthe house.  And on the first occasion of my sitting up in the evening I\nasked Catherine to read to me, because my eyes were weak.  We were in the\nlibrary, the master having gone to bed: she consented, rather\nunwillingly, I fancied; and imagining my sort of books did not suit her,\nI bid her please herself in the choice of what she perused.  She selected\none of her own favourites, and got forward steadily about an hour; then\ncame frequent questions.\n\n'Ellen, are not you tired?  Hadn't you better lie down now?  You'll be\nsick, keeping up so long, Ellen.'\n\n'No, no, dear, I'm not tired,' I returned, continually.\n\nPerceiving me immovable, she essayed another method of showing her\ndisrelish for her occupation.  It changed to yawning, and stretching,\nand--\n\n'Ellen, I'm tired.'\n\n'Give over then and talk,' I answered.\n\nThat was worse: she fretted and sighed, and looked at her watch till\neight, and finally went to her room, completely overdone with sleep;\njudging by her peevish, heavy look, and the constant rubbing she\ninflicted on her eyes.  The following night she seemed more impatient\nstill; and on the third from recovering my company she complained of a\nheadache, and left me.  I thought her conduct odd; and having remained\nalone a long while, I resolved on going and inquiring whether she were\nbetter, and asking her to come and lie on the sofa, instead of up-stairs\nin the dark.  No Catherine could I discover up-stairs, and none below.\nThe servants affirmed they had not seen her.  I listened at Mr. Edgar's\ndoor; all was silence.  I returned to her apartment, extinguished my\ncandle, and seated myself in the window.\n\nThe moon shone bright; a sprinkling of snow covered the ground, and I\nreflected that she might, possibly, have taken it into her head to walk\nabout the garden, for refreshment.  I did detect a figure creeping along\nthe inner fence of the park; but it was not my young mistress: on its\nemerging into the light, I recognised one of the grooms.  He stood a\nconsiderable period, viewing the carriage-road through the grounds; then\nstarted off at a brisk pace, as if he had detected something, and\nreappeared presently, leading Miss's pony; and there she was, just\ndismounted, and walking by its side.  The man took his charge stealthily\nacross the grass towards the stable.  Cathy entered by the\ncasement-window of the drawing-room, and glided noiselessly up to where I\nawaited her.  She put the door gently too, slipped off her snowy shoes,\nuntied her hat, and was proceeding, unconscious of my espionage, to lay\naside her mantle, when I suddenly rose and revealed myself.  The surprise\npetrified her an instant: she uttered an inarticulate exclamation, and\nstood fixed.\n\n'My dear Miss Catherine,' I began, too vividly impressed by her recent\nkindness to break into a scold, 'where have you been riding out at this\nhour?  And why should you try to deceive me by telling a tale?  Where\nhave you been?  Speak!'\n\n'To the bottom of the park,' she stammered.  'I didn't tell a tale.'\n\n'And nowhere else?' I demanded.\n\n'No,' was the muttered reply.\n\n'Oh, Catherine!' I cried, sorrowfully.  'You know you have been doing\nwrong, or you wouldn't be driven to uttering an untruth to me.  That does\ngrieve me.  I'd rather be three months ill, than hear you frame a\ndeliberate lie.'\n\nShe sprang forward, and bursting into tears, threw her arms round my\nneck.\n\n'Well, Ellen, I'm so afraid of you being angry,' she said.  'Promise not\nto be angry, and you shall know the very truth: I hate to hide it.'\n\nWe sat down in the window-seat; I assured her I would not scold, whatever\nher secret might be, and I guessed it, of course; so she commenced--\n\n'I've been to Wuthering Heights, Ellen, and I've never missed going a day\nsince you fell ill; except thrice before, and twice after you left your\nroom.  I gave Michael books and pictures to prepare Minny every evening,\nand to put her back in the stable: you mustn't scold him either, mind.  I\nwas at the Heights by half-past six, and generally stayed till half-past\neight, and then galloped home.  It was not to amuse myself that I went: I\nwas often wretched all the time.  Now and then I was happy: once in a\nweek perhaps.  At first, I expected there would be sad work persuading\nyou to let me keep my word to Linton: for I had engaged to call again\nnext day, when we quitted him; but, as you stayed up-stairs on the\nmorrow, I escaped that trouble.  While Michael was refastening the lock\nof the park door in the afternoon, I got possession of the key, and told\nhim how my cousin wished me to visit him, because he was sick, and\ncouldn't come to the Grange; and how papa would object to my going: and\nthen I negotiated with him about the pony.  He is fond of reading, and he\nthinks of leaving soon to get married; so he offered, if I would lend him\nbooks out of the library, to do what I wished: but I preferred giving him\nmy own, and that satisfied him better.\n\n'On my second visit Linton seemed in lively spirits; and Zillah (that is\ntheir housekeeper) made us a clean room and a good fire, and told us\nthat, as Joseph was out at a prayer-meeting and Hareton Earnshaw was off\nwith his dogs--robbing our woods of pheasants, as I heard afterwards--we\nmight do what we liked.  She brought me some warm wine and gingerbread,\nand appeared exceedingly good-natured, and Linton sat in the arm-chair,\nand I in the little rocking chair on the hearth-stone, and we laughed and\ntalked so merrily, and found so much to say: we planned where we would\ngo, and what we would do in summer.  I needn't repeat that, because you\nwould call it silly.\n\n'One time, however, we were near quarrelling.  He said the pleasantest\nmanner of spending a hot July day was lying from morning till evening on\na bank of heath in the middle of the moors, with the bees humming\ndreamily about among the bloom, and the larks singing high up overhead,\nand the blue sky and bright sun shining steadily and cloudlessly.  That\nwas his most perfect idea of heaven's happiness: mine was rocking in a\nrustling green tree, with a west wind blowing, and bright white clouds\nflitting rapidly above; and not only larks, but throstles, and\nblackbirds, and linnets, and cuckoos pouring out music on every side, and\nthe moors seen at a distance, broken into cool dusky dells; but close by\ngreat swells of long grass undulating in waves to the breeze; and woods\nand sounding water, and the whole world awake and wild with joy.  He\nwanted all to lie in an ecstasy of peace; I wanted all to sparkle and\ndance in a glorious jubilee.  I said his heaven would be only half alive;\nand he said mine would be drunk: I said I should fall asleep in his; and\nhe said he could not breathe in mine, and began to grow very snappish.  At\nlast, we agreed to try both, as soon as the right weather came; and then\nwe kissed each other and were friends.\n\n'After sitting still an hour, I looked at the great room with its smooth\nuncarpeted floor, and thought how nice it would be to play in, if we\nremoved the table; and I asked Linton to call Zillah in to help us, and\nwe'd have a game at blindman's-buff; she should try to catch us: you used\nto, you know, Ellen.  He wouldn't: there was no pleasure in it, he said;\nbut he consented to play at ball with me.  We found two in a cupboard,\namong a heap of old toys, tops, and hoops, and battledores and\nshuttlecocks.  One was marked C., and the other H.; I wished to have the\nC., because that stood for Catherine, and the H. might be for Heathcliff,\nhis name; but the bran came out of H., and Linton didn't like it.  I beat\nhim constantly: and he got cross again, and coughed, and returned to his\nchair.  That night, though, he easily recovered his good humour: he was\ncharmed with two or three pretty songs--_your_ songs, Ellen; and when I\nwas obliged to go, he begged and entreated me to come the following\nevening; and I promised.  Minny and I went flying home as light as air;\nand I dreamt of Wuthering Heights and my sweet, darling cousin, till\nmorning.\n\n'On the morrow I was sad; partly because you were poorly, and partly that\nI wished my father knew, and approved of my excursions: but it was\nbeautiful moonlight after tea; and, as I rode on, the gloom cleared.  I\nshall have another happy evening, I thought to myself; and what delights\nme more, my pretty Linton will.  I trotted up their garden, and was\nturning round to the back, when that fellow Earnshaw met me, took my\nbridle, and bid me go in by the front entrance.  He patted Minny's neck,\nand said she was a bonny beast, and appeared as if he wanted me to speak\nto him.  I only told him to leave my horse alone, or else it would kick\nhim.  He answered in his vulgar accent, \"It wouldn't do mitch hurt if it\ndid;\" and surveyed its legs with a smile.  I was half inclined to make it\ntry; however, he moved off to open the door, and, as he raised the latch,\nhe looked up to the inscription above, and said, with a stupid mixture of\nawkwardness and elation: \"Miss Catherine!  I can read yon, now.\"\n\n'\"Wonderful,\" I exclaimed.  \"Pray let us hear you--you _are_ grown\nclever!\"\n\n'He spelt, and drawled over by syllables, the name--\"Hareton Earnshaw.\"\n\n'\"And the figures?\" I cried, encouragingly, perceiving that he came to a\ndead halt.\n\n'\"I cannot tell them yet,\" he answered.\n\n'\"Oh, you dunce!\" I said, laughing heartily at his failure.\n\n'The fool stared, with a grin hovering about his lips, and a scowl\ngathering over his eyes, as if uncertain whether he might not join in my\nmirth: whether it were not pleasant familiarity, or what it really was,\ncontempt.  I settled his doubts, by suddenly retrieving my gravity and\ndesiring him to walk away, for I came to see Linton, not him.  He\nreddened--I saw that by the moonlight--dropped his hand from the latch,\nand skulked off, a picture of mortified vanity.  He imagined himself to\nbe as accomplished as Linton, I suppose, because he could spell his own\nname; and was marvellously discomfited that I didn't think the same.'\n\n'Stop, Miss Catherine, dear!'--I interrupted.  'I shall not scold, but I\ndon't like your conduct there.  If you had remembered that Hareton was\nyour cousin as much as Master Heathcliff, you would have felt how\nimproper it was to behave in that way.  At least, it was praiseworthy\nambition for him to desire to be as accomplished as Linton; and probably\nhe did not learn merely to show off: you had made him ashamed of his\nignorance before, I have no doubt; and he wished to remedy it and please\nyou.  To sneer at his imperfect attempt was very bad breeding.  Had you\nbeen brought up in his circumstances, would you be less rude?  He was as\nquick and as intelligent a child as ever you were; and I'm hurt that he\nshould be despised now, because that base Heathcliff has treated him so\nunjustly.'\n\n'Well, Ellen, you won't cry about it, will you?' she exclaimed, surprised\nat my earnestness.  'But wait, and you shall hear if he conned his A B C\nto please me; and if it were worth while being civil to the brute.  I\nentered; Linton was lying on the settle, and half got up to welcome me.\n\n'\"I'm ill to-night, Catherine, love,\" he said; \"and you must have all the\ntalk, and let me listen.  Come, and sit by me.  I was sure you wouldn't\nbreak your word, and I'll make you promise again, before you go.\"\n\n'I knew now that I mustn't tease him, as he was ill; and I spoke softly\nand put no questions, and avoided irritating him in any way.  I had\nbrought some of my nicest books for him: he asked me to read a little of\none, and I was about to comply, when Earnshaw burst the door open: having\ngathered venom with reflection.  He advanced direct to us, seized Linton\nby the arm, and swung him off the seat.\n\n'\"Get to thy own room!\" he said, in a voice almost inarticulate with\npassion; and his face looked swelled and furious.  \"Take her there if she\ncomes to see thee: thou shalln't keep me out of this.  Begone wi' ye\nboth!\"\n\n'He swore at us, and left Linton no time to answer, nearly throwing him\ninto the kitchen; and he clenched his fist as I followed, seemingly\nlonging to knock me down.  I was afraid for a moment, and I let one\nvolume fall; he kicked it after me, and shut us out.  I heard a\nmalignant, crackly laugh by the fire, and turning, beheld that odious\nJoseph standing rubbing his bony hands, and quivering.\n\n'\"I wer sure he'd sarve ye out!  He's a grand lad!  He's getten t' raight\nsperrit in him!  _He_ knaws--ay, he knaws, as weel as I do, who sud be t'\nmaister yonder--Ech, ech, ech!  He made ye skift properly!  Ech, ech,\nech!\"\n\n'\"Where must we go?\" I asked of my cousin, disregarding the old wretch's\nmockery.\n\n'Linton was white and trembling.  He was not pretty then, Ellen: oh, no!\nhe looked frightful; for his thin face and large eyes were wrought into\nan expression of frantic, powerless fury.  He grasped the handle of the\ndoor, and shook it: it was fastened inside.\n\n'\"If you don't let me in, I'll kill you!--If you don't let me in, I'll\nkill you!\" he rather shrieked than said.  \"Devil! devil!--I'll kill\nyou--I'll kill you!\"\n\nJoseph uttered his croaking laugh again.\n\n'\"Thear, that's t' father!\" he cried.  \"That's father!  We've allas\nsummut o' either side in us.  Niver heed, Hareton, lad--dunnut be\n'feard--he cannot get at thee!\"\n\n'I took hold of Linton's hands, and tried to pull him away; but he\nshrieked so shockingly that I dared not proceed.  At last his cries were\nchoked by a dreadful fit of coughing; blood gushed from his mouth, and he\nfell on the ground.  I ran into the yard, sick with terror; and called\nfor Zillah, as loud as I could.  She soon heard me: she was milking the\ncows in a shed behind the barn, and hurrying from her work, she inquired\nwhat there was to do?  I hadn't breath to explain; dragging her in, I\nlooked about for Linton.  Earnshaw had come out to examine the mischief\nhe had caused, and he was then conveying the poor thing up-stairs.  Zillah\nand I ascended after him; but he stopped me at the top of the steps, and\nsaid I shouldn't go in: I must go home.  I exclaimed that he had killed\nLinton, and I _would_ enter.  Joseph locked the door, and declared I\nshould do \"no sich stuff,\" and asked me whether I were \"bahn to be as mad\nas him.\"  I stood crying till the housekeeper reappeared.  She affirmed\nhe would be better in a bit, but he couldn't do with that shrieking and\ndin; and she took me, and nearly carried me into the house.\n\n'Ellen, I was ready to tear my hair off my head!  I sobbed and wept so\nthat my eyes were almost blind; and the ruffian you have such sympathy\nwith stood opposite: presuming every now and then to bid me \"wisht,\" and\ndenying that it was his fault; and, finally, frightened by my assertions\nthat I would tell papa, and that he should be put in prison and hanged,\nhe commenced blubbering himself, and hurried out to hide his cowardly\nagitation.  Still, I was not rid of him: when at length they compelled me\nto depart, and I had got some hundred yards off the premises, he suddenly\nissued from the shadow of the road-side, and checked Minny and took hold\nof me.\n\n'\"Miss Catherine, I'm ill grieved,\" he began, \"but it's rayther too bad--\"\n\n'I gave him a cut with my whip, thinking perhaps he would murder me.  He\nlet go, thundering one of his horrid curses, and I galloped home more\nthan half out of my senses.\n\n'I didn't bid you good-night that evening, and I didn't go to Wuthering\nHeights the next: I wished to go exceedingly; but I was strangely\nexcited, and dreaded to hear that Linton was dead, sometimes; and\nsometimes shuddered at the thought of encountering Hareton.  On the third\nday I took courage: at least, I couldn't bear longer suspense, and stole\noff once more.  I went at five o'clock, and walked; fancying I might\nmanage to creep into the house, and up to Linton's room, unobserved.\nHowever, the dogs gave notice of my approach.  Zillah received me, and\nsaying \"the lad was mending nicely,\" showed me into a small, tidy,\ncarpeted apartment, where, to my inexpressible joy, I beheld Linton laid\non a little sofa, reading one of my books.  But he would neither speak to\nme nor look at me, through a whole hour, Ellen: he has such an unhappy\ntemper.  And what quite confounded me, when he did open his mouth, it was\nto utter the falsehood that I had occasioned the uproar, and Hareton was\nnot to blame!  Unable to reply, except passionately, I got up and walked\nfrom the room.  He sent after me a faint \"Catherine!\"  He did not reckon\non being answered so: but I wouldn't turn back; and the morrow was the\nsecond day on which I stayed at home, nearly determined to visit him no\nmore.  But it was so miserable going to bed and getting up, and never\nhearing anything about him, that my resolution melted into air before it\nwas properly formed.  It had appeared wrong to take the journey once; now\nit seemed wrong to refrain.  Michael came to ask if he must saddle Minny;\nI said \"Yes,\" and considered myself doing a duty as she bore me over the\nhills.  I was forced to pass the front windows to get to the court: it\nwas no use trying to conceal my presence.\n\n'\"Young master is in the house,\" said Zillah, as she saw me making for\nthe parlour.  I went in; Earnshaw was there also, but he quitted the room\ndirectly.  Linton sat in the great arm-chair half asleep; walking up to\nthe fire, I began in a serious tone, partly meaning it to be true--\n\n'\"As you don't like me, Linton, and as you think I come on purpose to\nhurt you, and pretend that I do so every time, this is our last meeting:\nlet us say good-bye; and tell Mr. Heathcliff that you have no wish to see\nme, and that he mustn't invent any more falsehoods on the subject.\"\n\n'\"Sit down and take your hat off, Catherine,\" he answered.  \"You are so\nmuch happier than I am, you ought to be better.  Papa talks enough of my\ndefects, and shows enough scorn of me, to make it natural I should doubt\nmyself.  I doubt whether I am not altogether as worthless as he calls me,\nfrequently; and then I feel so cross and bitter, I hate everybody!  I am\nworthless, and bad in temper, and bad in spirit, almost always; and, if\nyou choose, you may say good-bye: you'll get rid of an annoyance.  Only,\nCatherine, do me this justice: believe that if I might be as sweet, and\nas kind, and as good as you are, I would be; as willingly, and more so,\nthan as happy and as healthy.  And believe that your kindness has made me\nlove you deeper than if I deserved your love: and though I couldn't, and\ncannot help showing my nature to you, I regret it and repent it; and\nshall regret and repent it till I die!\"\n\n'I felt he spoke the truth; and I felt I must forgive him: and, though we\nshould quarrel the next moment, I must forgive him again.  We were\nreconciled; but we cried, both of us, the whole time I stayed: not\nentirely for sorrow; yet I _was_ sorry Linton had that distorted nature.\nHe'll never let his friends be at ease, and he'll never be at ease\nhimself!  I have always gone to his little parlour, since that night;\nbecause his father returned the day after.\n\n'About three times, I think, we have been merry and hopeful, as we were\nthe first evening; the rest of my visits were dreary and troubled: now\nwith his selfishness and spite, and now with his sufferings: but I've\nlearned to endure the former with nearly as little resentment as the\nlatter.  Mr. Heathcliff purposely avoids me: I have hardly seen him at\nall.  Last Sunday, indeed, coming earlier than usual, I heard him abusing\npoor Linton cruelly for his conduct of the night before.  I can't tell\nhow he knew of it, unless he listened.  Linton had certainly behaved\nprovokingly: however, it was the business of nobody but me, and I\ninterrupted Mr. Heathcliff's lecture by entering and telling him so.  He\nburst into a laugh, and went away, saying he was glad I took that view of\nthe matter.  Since then, I've told Linton he must whisper his bitter\nthings.  Now, Ellen, you have heard all.  I can't be prevented from going\nto Wuthering Heights, except by inflicting misery on two people; whereas,\nif you'll only not tell papa, my going need disturb the tranquillity of\nnone.  You'll not tell, will you?  It will be very heartless, if you do.'\n\n'I'll make up my mind on that point by to-morrow, Miss Catherine,' I\nreplied.  'It requires some study; and so I'll leave you to your rest,\nand go think it over.'\n\nI thought it over aloud, in my master's presence; walking straight from\nher room to his, and relating the whole story: with the exception of her\nconversations with her cousin, and any mention of Hareton.  Mr. Linton\nwas alarmed and distressed, more than he would acknowledge to me.  In the\nmorning, Catherine learnt my betrayal of her confidence, and she learnt\nalso that her secret visits were to end.  In vain she wept and writhed\nagainst the interdict, and implored her father to have pity on Linton:\nall she got to comfort her was a promise that he would write and give him\nleave to come to the Grange when he pleased; but explaining that he must\nno longer expect to see Catherine at Wuthering Heights.  Perhaps, had he\nbeen aware of his nephew's disposition and state of health, he would have\nseen fit to withhold even that slight consolation.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXV\n\n\n'These things happened last winter, sir,' said Mrs. Dean; 'hardly more\nthan a year ago.  Last winter, I did not think, at another twelve months'\nend, I should be amusing a stranger to the family with relating them!\nYet, who knows how long you'll be a stranger?  You're too young to rest\nalways contented, living by yourself; and I some way fancy no one could\nsee Catherine Linton and not love her.  You smile; but why do you look so\nlively and interested when I talk about her? and why have you asked me to\nhang her picture over your fireplace? and why--?'\n\n'Stop, my good friend!' I cried.  'It may be very possible that _I_\nshould love her; but would she love me?  I doubt it too much to venture\nmy tranquillity by running into temptation: and then my home is not here.\nI'm of the busy world, and to its arms I must return.  Go on.  Was\nCatherine obedient to her father's commands?'\n\n'She was,' continued the housekeeper.  'Her affection for him was still\nthe chief sentiment in her heart; and he spoke without anger: he spoke in\nthe deep tenderness of one about to leave his treasure amid perils and\nfoes, where his remembered words would be the only aid that he could\nbequeath to guide her.  He said to me, a few days afterwards, \"I wish my\nnephew would write, Ellen, or call.  Tell me, sincerely, what you think\nof him: is he changed for the better, or is there a prospect of\nimprovement, as he grows a man?\"\n\n'\"He's very delicate, sir,\" I replied; \"and scarcely likely to reach\nmanhood: but this I can say, he does not resemble his father; and if Miss\nCatherine had the misfortune to marry him, he would not be beyond her\ncontrol: unless she were extremely and foolishly indulgent.  However,\nmaster, you'll have plenty of time to get acquainted with him and see\nwhether he would suit her: it wants four years and more to his being of\nage.\"'\n\nEdgar sighed; and, walking to the window, looked out towards Gimmerton\nKirk. It was a misty afternoon, but the February sun shone dimly, and we\ncould just distinguish the two fir-trees in the yard, and the\nsparely-scattered gravestones.\n\n'I've prayed often,' he half soliloquised, 'for the approach of what is\ncoming; and now I begin to shrink, and fear it.  I thought the memory of\nthe hour I came down that glen a bridegroom would be less sweet than the\nanticipation that I was soon, in a few months, or, possibly, weeks, to be\ncarried up, and laid in its lonely hollow!  Ellen, I've been very happy\nwith my little Cathy: through winter nights and summer days she was a\nliving hope at my side.  But I've been as happy musing by myself among\nthose stones, under that old church: lying, through the long June\nevenings, on the green mound of her mother's grave, and wishing--yearning\nfor the time when I might lie beneath it.  What can I do for Cathy?  How\nmust I quit her?  I'd not care one moment for Linton being Heathcliff's\nson; nor for his taking her from me, if he could console her for my loss.\nI'd not care that Heathcliff gained his ends, and triumphed in robbing me\nof my last blessing!  But should Linton be unworthy--only a feeble tool\nto his father--I cannot abandon her to him!  And, hard though it be to\ncrush her buoyant spirit, I must persevere in making her sad while I\nlive, and leaving her solitary when I die.  Darling!  I'd rather resign\nher to God, and lay her in the earth before me.'\n\n'Resign her to God as it is, sir,' I answered, 'and if we should lose\nyou--which may He forbid--under His providence, I'll stand her friend and\ncounsellor to the last.  Miss Catherine is a good girl: I don't fear that\nshe will go wilfully wrong; and people who do their duty are always\nfinally rewarded.'\n\nSpring advanced; yet my master gathered no real strength, though he\nresumed his walks in the grounds with his daughter.  To her inexperienced\nnotions, this itself was a sign of convalescence; and then his cheek was\noften flushed, and his eyes were bright; she felt sure of his recovering.\nOn her seventeenth birthday, he did not visit the churchyard: it was\nraining, and I observed--'You'll surely not go out to-night, sir?'\n\nHe answered,--'No, I'll defer it this year a little longer.'  He wrote\nagain to Linton, expressing his great desire to see him; and, had the\ninvalid been presentable, I've no doubt his father would have permitted\nhim to come.  As it was, being instructed, he returned an answer,\nintimating that Mr. Heathcliff objected to his calling at the Grange; but\nhis uncle's kind remembrance delighted him, and he hoped to meet him\nsometimes in his rambles, and personally to petition that his cousin and\nhe might not remain long so utterly divided.\n\nThat part of his letter was simple, and probably his own.  Heathcliff\nknew he could plead eloquently for Catherine's company, then.\n\n'I do not ask,' he said, 'that she may visit here; but am I never to see\nher, because my father forbids me to go to her home, and you forbid her\nto come to mine?  Do, now and then, ride with her towards the Heights;\nand let us exchange a few words, in your presence!  We have done nothing\nto deserve this separation; and you are not angry with me: you have no\nreason to dislike me, you allow, yourself.  Dear uncle! send me a kind\nnote to-morrow, and leave to join you anywhere you please, except at\nThrushcross Grange.  I believe an interview would convince you that my\nfather's character is not mine: he affirms I am more your nephew than his\nson; and though I have faults which render me unworthy of Catherine, she\nhas excused them, and for her sake, you should also.  You inquire after\nmy health--it is better; but while I remain cut off from all hope, and\ndoomed to solitude, or the society of those who never did and never will\nlike me, how can I be cheerful and well?'\n\nEdgar, though he felt for the boy, could not consent to grant his\nrequest; because he could not accompany Catherine.  He said, in summer,\nperhaps, they might meet: meantime, he wished him to continue writing at\nintervals, and engaged to give him what advice and comfort he was able by\nletter; being well aware of his hard position in his family.  Linton\ncomplied; and had he been unrestrained, would probably have spoiled all\nby filling his epistles with complaints and lamentations: but his father\nkept a sharp watch over him; and, of course, insisted on every line that\nmy master sent being shown; so, instead of penning his peculiar personal\nsufferings and distresses, the themes constantly uppermost in his\nthoughts, he harped on the cruel obligation of being held asunder from\nhis friend and love; and gently intimated that Mr. Linton must allow an\ninterview soon, or he should fear he was purposely deceiving him with\nempty promises.\n\nCathy was a powerful ally at home; and between them they at length\npersuaded my master to acquiesce in their having a ride or a walk\ntogether about once a week, under my guardianship, and on the moors\nnearest the Grange: for June found him still declining.  Though he had\nset aside yearly a portion of his income for my young lady's fortune, he\nhad a natural desire that she might retain--or at least return in a short\ntime to--the house of her ancestors; and he considered her only prospect\nof doing that was by a union with his heir; he had no idea that the\nlatter was failing almost as fast as himself; nor had any one, I believe:\nno doctor visited the Heights, and no one saw Master Heathcliff to make\nreport of his condition among us.  I, for my part, began to fancy my\nforebodings were false, and that he must be actually rallying, when he\nmentioned riding and walking on the moors, and seemed so earnest in\npursuing his object.  I could not picture a father treating a dying child\nas tyrannically and wickedly as I afterwards learned Heathcliff had\ntreated him, to compel this apparent eagerness: his efforts redoubling\nthe more imminently his avaricious and unfeeling plans were threatened\nwith defeat by death.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVI\n\n\nSummer was already past its prime, when Edgar reluctantly yielded his\nassent to their entreaties, and Catherine and I set out on our first ride\nto join her cousin.  It was a close, sultry day: devoid of sunshine, but\nwith a sky too dappled and hazy to threaten rain: and our place of\nmeeting had been fixed at the guide-stone, by the cross-roads.  On\narriving there, however, a little herd-boy, despatched as a messenger,\ntold us that,--'Maister Linton wer just o' this side th' Heights: and\nhe'd be mitch obleeged to us to gang on a bit further.'\n\n'Then Master Linton has forgot the first injunction of his uncle,' I\nobserved: 'he bid us keep on the Grange land, and here we are off at\nonce.'\n\n'Well, we'll turn our horses' heads round when we reach him,' answered my\ncompanion; 'our excursion shall lie towards home.'\n\nBut when we reached him, and that was scarcely a quarter of a mile from\nhis own door, we found he had no horse; and we were forced to dismount,\nand leave ours to graze.  He lay on the heath, awaiting our approach, and\ndid not rise till we came within a few yards.  Then he walked so feebly,\nand looked so pale, that I immediately exclaimed,--'Why, Master\nHeathcliff, you are not fit for enjoying a ramble this morning.  How ill\nyou do look!'\n\nCatherine surveyed him with grief and astonishment: she changed the\nejaculation of joy on her lips to one of alarm; and the congratulation on\ntheir long-postponed meeting to an anxious inquiry, whether he were worse\nthan usual?\n\n'No--better--better!' he panted, trembling, and retaining her hand as if\nhe needed its support, while his large blue eyes wandered timidly over\nher; the hollowness round them transforming to haggard wildness the\nlanguid expression they once possessed.\n\n'But you have been worse,' persisted his cousin; 'worse than when I saw\nyou last; you are thinner, and--'\n\n'I'm tired,' he interrupted, hurriedly.  'It is too hot for walking, let\nus rest here.  And, in the morning, I often feel sick--papa says I grow\nso fast.'\n\nBadly satisfied, Cathy sat down, and he reclined beside her.\n\n'This is something like your paradise,' said she, making an effort at\ncheerfulness.  'You recollect the two days we agreed to spend in the\nplace and way each thought pleasantest?  This is nearly yours, only there\nare clouds; but then they are so soft and mellow: it is nicer than\nsunshine.  Next week, if you can, we'll ride down to the Grange Park, and\ntry mine.'\n\nLinton did not appear to remember what she talked of and he had evidently\ngreat difficulty in sustaining any kind of conversation.  His lack of\ninterest in the subjects she started, and his equal incapacity to\ncontribute to her entertainment, were so obvious that she could not\nconceal her disappointment.  An indefinite alteration had come over his\nwhole person and manner.  The pettishness that might be caressed into\nfondness, had yielded to a listless apathy; there was less of the peevish\ntemper of a child which frets and teases on purpose to be soothed, and\nmore of the self-absorbed moroseness of a confirmed invalid, repelling\nconsolation, and ready to regard the good-humoured mirth of others as an\ninsult.  Catherine perceived, as well as I did, that he held it rather a\npunishment, than a gratification, to endure our company; and she made no\nscruple of proposing, presently, to depart.  That proposal, unexpectedly,\nroused Linton from his lethargy, and threw him into a strange state of\nagitation.  He glanced fearfully towards the Heights, begging she would\nremain another half-hour, at least.\n\n'But I think,' said Cathy, 'you'd be more comfortable at home than\nsitting here; and I cannot amuse you to-day, I see, by my tales, and\nsongs, and chatter: you have grown wiser than I, in these six months; you\nhave little taste for my diversions now: or else, if I could amuse you,\nI'd willingly stay.'\n\n'Stay to rest yourself,' he replied.  'And, Catherine, don't think or say\nthat I'm _very_ unwell: it is the heavy weather and heat that make me\ndull; and I walked about, before you came, a great deal for me.  Tell\nuncle I'm in tolerable health, will you?'\n\n'I'll tell him that _you_ say so, Linton.  I couldn't affirm that you\nare,' observed my young lady, wondering at his pertinacious assertion of\nwhat was evidently an untruth.\n\n'And be here again next Thursday,' continued he, shunning her puzzled\ngaze.  'And give him my thanks for permitting you to come--my best\nthanks, Catherine.  And--and, if you _did_ meet my father, and he asked\nyou about me, don't lead him to suppose that I've been extremely silent\nand stupid: don't look sad and downcast, as you are doing--he'll be\nangry.'\n\n'I care nothing for his anger,' exclaimed Cathy, imagining she would be\nits object.\n\n'But I do,' said her cousin, shuddering.  '_Don't_ provoke him against\nme, Catherine, for he is very hard.'\n\n'Is he severe to you, Master Heathcliff?' I inquired.  'Has he grown\nweary of indulgence, and passed from passive to active hatred?'\n\nLinton looked at me, but did not answer; and, after keeping her seat by\nhis side another ten minutes, during which his head fell drowsily on his\nbreast, and he uttered nothing except suppressed moans of exhaustion or\npain, Cathy began to seek solace in looking for bilberries, and sharing\nthe produce of her researches with me: she did not offer them to him, for\nshe saw further notice would only weary and annoy.\n\n'Is it half-an-hour now, Ellen?' she whispered in my ear, at last.  'I\ncan't tell why we should stay.  He's asleep, and papa will be wanting us\nback.'\n\n'Well, we must not leave him asleep,' I answered; 'wait till he wakes,\nand be patient.  You were mighty eager to set off, but your longing to\nsee poor Linton has soon evaporated!'\n\n'Why did _he_ wish to see me?' returned Catherine.  'In his crossest\nhumours, formerly, I liked him better than I do in his present curious\nmood.  It's just as if it were a task he was compelled to perform--this\ninterview--for fear his father should scold him.  But I'm hardly going to\ncome to give Mr. Heathcliff pleasure; whatever reason he may have for\nordering Linton to undergo this penance.  And, though I'm glad he's\nbetter in health, I'm sorry he's so much less pleasant, and so much less\naffectionate to me.'\n\n'You think _he is_ better in health, then?' I said.\n\n'Yes,' she answered; 'because he always made such a great deal of his\nsufferings, you know.  He is not tolerably well, as he told me to tell\npapa; but he's better, very likely.'\n\n'There you differ with me, Miss Cathy,' I remarked; 'I should conjecture\nhim to be far worse.'\n\nLinton here started from his slumber in bewildered terror, and asked if\nany one had called his name.\n\n'No,' said Catherine; 'unless in dreams.  I cannot conceive how you\nmanage to doze out of doors, in the morning.'\n\n'I thought I heard my father,' he gasped, glancing up to the frowning nab\nabove us.  'You are sure nobody spoke?'\n\n'Quite sure,' replied his cousin.  'Only Ellen and I were disputing\nconcerning your health.  Are you truly stronger, Linton, than when we\nseparated in winter?  If you be, I'm certain one thing is not\nstronger--your regard for me: speak,--are you?'\n\nThe tears gushed from Linton's eyes as he answered, 'Yes, yes, I am!'\nAnd, still under the spell of the imaginary voice, his gaze wandered up\nand down to detect its owner.\n\nCathy rose.  'For to-day we must part,' she said.  'And I won't conceal\nthat I have been sadly disappointed with our meeting; though I'll mention\nit to nobody but you: not that I stand in awe of Mr. Heathcliff.'\n\n'Hush,' murmured Linton; 'for God's sake, hush!  He's coming.'  And he\nclung to Catherine's arm, striving to detain her; but at that\nannouncement she hastily disengaged herself, and whistled to Minny, who\nobeyed her like a dog.\n\n'I'll be here next Thursday,' she cried, springing to the saddle.\n'Good-bye. Quick, Ellen!'\n\nAnd so we left him, scarcely conscious of our departure, so absorbed was\nhe in anticipating his father's approach.\n\nBefore we reached home, Catherine's displeasure softened into a perplexed\nsensation of pity and regret, largely blended with vague, uneasy doubts\nabout Linton's actual circumstances, physical and social: in which I\npartook, though I counselled her not to say much; for a second journey\nwould make us better judges.  My master requested an account of our\nongoings.  His nephew's offering of thanks was duly delivered, Miss Cathy\ngently touching on the rest: I also threw little light on his inquiries,\nfor I hardly knew what to hide and what to reveal.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVII\n\n\nSeven days glided away, every one marking its course by the henceforth\nrapid alteration of Edgar Linton's state.  The havoc that months had\npreviously wrought was now emulated by the inroads of hours.  Catherine\nwe would fain have deluded yet; but her own quick spirit refused to\ndelude her: it divined in secret, and brooded on the dreadful\nprobability, gradually ripening into certainty.  She had not the heart to\nmention her ride, when Thursday came round; I mentioned it for her, and\nobtained permission to order her out of doors: for the library, where her\nfather stopped a short time daily--the brief period he could bear to sit\nup--and his chamber, had become her whole world.  She grudged each moment\nthat did not find her bending over his pillow, or seated by his side.  Her\ncountenance grew wan with watching and sorrow, and my master gladly\ndismissed her to what he flattered himself would be a happy change of\nscene and society; drawing comfort from the hope that she would not now\nbe left entirely alone after his death.\n\nHe had a fixed idea, I guessed by several observations he let fall, that,\nas his nephew resembled him in person, he would resemble him in mind; for\nLinton's letters bore few or no indications of his defective character.\nAnd I, through pardonable weakness, refrained from correcting the error;\nasking myself what good there would be in disturbing his last moments\nwith information that he had neither power nor opportunity to turn to\naccount.\n\nWe deferred our excursion till the afternoon; a golden afternoon of\nAugust: every breath from the hills so full of life, that it seemed\nwhoever respired it, though dying, might revive.  Catherine's face was\njust like the landscape--shadows and sunshine flitting over it in rapid\nsuccession; but the shadows rested longer, and the sunshine was more\ntransient; and her poor little heart reproached itself for even that\npassing forgetfulness of its cares.\n\nWe discerned Linton watching at the same spot he had selected before.  My\nyoung mistress alighted, and told me that, as she was resolved to stay a\nvery little while, I had better hold the pony and remain on horseback;\nbut I dissented: I wouldn't risk losing sight of the charge committed to\nme a minute; so we climbed the slope of heath together.  Master\nHeathcliff received us with greater animation on this occasion: not the\nanimation of high spirits though, nor yet of joy; it looked more like\nfear.\n\n'It is late!' he said, speaking short and with difficulty.  'Is not your\nfather very ill?  I thought you wouldn't come.'\n\n'_Why_ won't you be candid?' cried Catherine, swallowing her greeting.\n'Why cannot you say at once you don't want me?  It is strange, Linton,\nthat for the second time you have brought me here on purpose, apparently\nto distress us both, and for no reason besides!'\n\nLinton shivered, and glanced at her, half supplicating, half ashamed; but\nhis cousin's patience was not sufficient to endure this enigmatical\nbehaviour.\n\n'My father _is_ very ill,' she said; 'and why am I called from his\nbedside?  Why didn't you send to absolve me from my promise, when you\nwished I wouldn't keep it?  Come!  I desire an explanation: playing and\ntrifling are completely banished out of my mind; and I can't dance\nattendance on your affectations now!'\n\n'My affectations!' he murmured; 'what are they?  For heaven's sake,\nCatherine, don't look so angry!  Despise me as much as you please; I am a\nworthless, cowardly wretch: I can't be scorned enough; but I'm too mean\nfor your anger.  Hate my father, and spare me for contempt.'\n\n'Nonsense!' cried Catherine in a passion.  'Foolish, silly boy!  And\nthere! he trembles: as if I were really going to touch him!  You needn't\nbespeak contempt, Linton: anybody will have it spontaneously at your\nservice.  Get off!  I shall return home: it is folly dragging you from\nthe hearth-stone, and pretending--what do we pretend?  Let go my frock!\nIf I pitied you for crying and looking so very frightened, you should\nspurn such pity.  Ellen, tell him how disgraceful this conduct is.  Rise,\nand don't degrade yourself into an abject reptile--_don't_!'\n\nWith streaming face and an expression of agony, Linton had thrown his\nnerveless frame along the ground: he seemed convulsed with exquisite\nterror.\n\n'Oh!' he sobbed, 'I cannot bear it!  Catherine, Catherine, I'm a traitor,\ntoo, and I dare not tell you!  But leave me, and I shall be killed!\n_Dear_ Catherine, my life is in your hands: and you have said you loved\nme, and if you did, it wouldn't harm you.  You'll not go, then? kind,\nsweet, good Catherine!  And perhaps you _will_ consent--and he'll let me\ndie with you!'\n\nMy young lady, on witnessing his intense anguish, stooped to raise him.\nThe old feeling of indulgent tenderness overcame her vexation, and she\ngrew thoroughly moved and alarmed.\n\n'Consent to what?' she asked.  'To stay! tell me the meaning of this\nstrange talk, and I will.  You contradict your own words, and distract\nme!  Be calm and frank, and confess at once all that weighs on your\nheart.  You wouldn't injure me, Linton, would you?  You wouldn't let any\nenemy hurt me, if you could prevent it?  I'll believe you are a coward,\nfor yourself, but not a cowardly betrayer of your best friend.'\n\n'But my father threatened me,' gasped the boy, clasping his attenuated\nfingers, 'and I dread him--I dread him!  I _dare_ not tell!'\n\n'Oh, well!' said Catherine, with scornful compassion, 'keep your secret:\n_I'm_ no coward.  Save yourself: I'm not afraid!'\n\nHer magnanimity provoked his tears: he wept wildly, kissing her\nsupporting hands, and yet could not summon courage to speak out.  I was\ncogitating what the mystery might be, and determined Catherine should\nnever suffer to benefit him or any one else, by my good will; when,\nhearing a rustle among the ling, I looked up and saw Mr. Heathcliff\nalmost close upon us, descending the Heights.  He didn't cast a glance\ntowards my companions, though they were sufficiently near for Linton's\nsobs to be audible; but hailing me in the almost hearty tone he assumed\nto none besides, and the sincerity of which I couldn't avoid doubting, he\nsaid--\n\n'It is something to see you so near to my house, Nelly.  How are you at\nthe Grange?  Let us hear.  The rumour goes,' he added, in a lower tone,\n'that Edgar Linton is on his death-bed: perhaps they exaggerate his\nillness?'\n\n'No; my master is dying,' I replied: 'it is true enough.  A sad thing it\nwill be for us all, but a blessing for him!'\n\n'How long will he last, do you think?' he asked.\n\n'I don't know,' I said.\n\n'Because,' he continued, looking at the two young people, who were fixed\nunder his eye--Linton appeared as if he could not venture to stir or\nraise his head, and Catherine could not move, on his account--'because\nthat lad yonder seems determined to beat me; and I'd thank his uncle to\nbe quick, and go before him!  Hallo! has the whelp been playing that game\nlong?  I _did_ give him some lessons about snivelling.  Is he pretty\nlively with Miss Linton generally?'\n\n'Lively? no--he has shown the greatest distress,' I answered.  'To see\nhim, I should say, that instead of rambling with his sweetheart on the\nhills, he ought to be in bed, under the hands of a doctor.'\n\n'He shall be, in a day or two,' muttered Heathcliff.  'But first--get up,\nLinton!  Get up!' he shouted.  'Don't grovel on the ground there up, this\nmoment!'\n\nLinton had sunk prostrate again in another paroxysm of helpless fear,\ncaused by his father's glance towards him, I suppose: there was nothing\nelse to produce such humiliation.  He made several efforts to obey, but\nhis little strength was annihilated for the time, and he fell back again\nwith a moan.  Mr. Heathcliff advanced, and lifted him to lean against a\nridge of turf.\n\n'Now,' said he, with curbed ferocity, 'I'm getting angry and if you don't\ncommand that paltry spirit of yours--_damn_ you! get up directly!'\n\n'I will, father,' he panted.  'Only, let me alone, or I shall faint.  I've\ndone as you wished, I'm sure.  Catherine will tell you that I--that\nI--have been cheerful.  Ah! keep by me, Catherine; give me your hand.'\n\n'Take mine,' said his father; 'stand on your feet.  There now--she'll\nlend you her arm: that's right, look at her.  You would imagine I was the\ndevil himself, Miss Linton, to excite such horror.  Be so kind as to walk\nhome with him, will you?  He shudders if I touch him.'\n\n'Linton dear!' whispered Catherine, 'I can't go to Wuthering Heights:\npapa has forbidden me.  He'll not harm you: why are you so afraid?'\n\n'I can never re-enter that house,' he answered.  'I'm _not_ to re-enter\nit without you!'\n\n'Stop!' cried his father.  'We'll respect Catherine's filial scruples.\nNelly, take him in, and I'll follow your advice concerning the doctor,\nwithout delay.'\n\n'You'll do well,' replied I.  'But I must remain with my mistress: to\nmind your son is not my business.'\n\n'You are very stiff,' said Heathcliff, 'I know that: but you'll force me\nto pinch the baby and make it scream before it moves your charity.  Come,\nthen, my hero.  Are you willing to return, escorted by me?'\n\nHe approached once more, and made as if he would seize the fragile being;\nbut, shrinking back, Linton clung to his cousin, and implored her to\naccompany him, with a frantic importunity that admitted no denial.\nHowever I disapproved, I couldn't hinder her: indeed, how could she have\nrefused him herself?  What was filling him with dread we had no means of\ndiscerning; but there he was, powerless under its gripe, and any addition\nseemed capable of shocking him into idiotcy.  We reached the threshold;\nCatherine walked in, and I stood waiting till she had conducted the\ninvalid to a chair, expecting her out immediately; when Mr. Heathcliff,\npushing me forward, exclaimed--'My house is not stricken with the plague,\nNelly; and I have a mind to be hospitable to-day: sit down, and allow me\nto shut the door.'\n\nHe shut and locked it also.  I started.\n\n'You shall have tea before you go home,' he added.  'I am by myself.\nHareton is gone with some cattle to the Lees, and Zillah and Joseph are\noff on a journey of pleasure; and, though I'm used to being alone, I'd\nrather have some interesting company, if I can get it.  Miss Linton, take\nyour seat by _him_.  I give you what I have: the present is hardly worth\naccepting; but I have nothing else to offer.  It is Linton, I mean.  How\nshe does stare!  It's odd what a savage feeling I have to anything that\nseems afraid of me!  Had I been born where laws are less strict and\ntastes less dainty, I should treat myself to a slow vivisection of those\ntwo, as an evening's amusement.'\n\nHe drew in his breath, struck the table, and swore to himself, 'By hell!\nI hate them.'\n\n'I am not afraid of you!' exclaimed Catherine, who could not hear the\nlatter part of his speech.  She stepped close up; her black eyes flashing\nwith passion and resolution.  'Give me that key: I will have it!' she\nsaid.  'I wouldn't eat or drink here, if I were starving.'\n\nHeathcliff had the key in his hand that remained on the table.  He looked\nup, seized with a sort of surprise at her boldness; or, possibly,\nreminded, by her voice and glance, of the person from whom she inherited\nit.  She snatched at the instrument, and half succeeded in getting it out\nof his loosened fingers: but her action recalled him to the present; he\nrecovered it speedily.\n\n'Now, Catherine Linton,' he said, 'stand off, or I shall knock you down;\nand, that will make Mrs. Dean mad.'\n\nRegardless of this warning, she captured his closed hand and its contents\nagain.  'We _will_ go!' she repeated, exerting her utmost efforts to cause\nthe iron muscles to relax; and finding that her nails made no impression,\nshe applied her teeth pretty sharply.  Heathcliff glanced at me a glance\nthat kept me from interfering a moment.  Catherine was too intent on his\nfingers to notice his face.  He opened them suddenly, and resigned the\nobject of dispute; but, ere she had well secured it, he seized her with\nthe liberated hand, and, pulling her on his knee, administered with the\nother a shower of terrific slaps on both sides of the head, each\nsufficient to have fulfilled his threat, had she been able to fall.\n\nAt this diabolical violence I rushed on him furiously. 'You villain!' I\nbegan to cry, 'you villain!' A touch on the chest silenced me: I am\nstout, and soon put out of breath; and, what with that and the rage, I\nstaggered dizzily back and felt ready to suffocate, or to burst a\nblood-vessel. The scene was over in two minutes; Catherine, released,\nput her two hands to her temples, and looked just as if she were not\nsure whether her ears were off or on. She trembled like a reed, poor\nthing, and leant against the table perfectly bewildered.\n\n'I know how to chastise children, you see,' said the scoundrel, grimly,\nas he stooped to repossess himself of the key, which had dropped to the\nfloor.  'Go to Linton now, as I told you; and cry at your ease!  I shall\nbe your father, to-morrow--all the father you'll have in a few days--and\nyou shall have plenty of that.  You can bear plenty; you're no weakling:\nyou shall have a daily taste, if I catch such a devil of a temper in your\neyes again!'\n\nCathy ran to me instead of Linton, and knelt down and put her burning\ncheek on my lap, weeping aloud.  Her cousin had shrunk into a corner of\nthe settle, as quiet as a mouse, congratulating himself, I dare say, that\nthe correction had alighted on another than him.  Mr. Heathcliff,\nperceiving us all confounded, rose, and expeditiously made the tea\nhimself.  The cups and saucers were laid ready.  He poured it out, and\nhanded me a cup.\n\n'Wash away your spleen,' he said.  'And help your own naughty pet and\nmine.  It is not poisoned, though I prepared it.  I'm going out to seek\nyour horses.'\n\nOur first thought, on his departure, was to force an exit somewhere.  We\ntried the kitchen door, but that was fastened outside: we looked at the\nwindows--they were too narrow for even Cathy's little figure.\n\n'Master Linton,' I cried, seeing we were regularly imprisoned, 'you know\nwhat your diabolical father is after, and you shall tell us, or I'll box\nyour ears, as he has done your cousin's.'\n\n'Yes, Linton, you must tell,' said Catherine.  'It was for your sake I\ncame; and it will be wickedly ungrateful if you refuse.'\n\n'Give me some tea, I'm thirsty, and then I'll tell you,' he answered.\n'Mrs. Dean, go away.  I don't like you standing over me.  Now, Catherine,\nyou are letting your tears fall into my cup.  I won't drink that.  Give\nme another.'  Catherine pushed another to him, and wiped her face.  I\nfelt disgusted at the little wretch's composure, since he was no longer\nin terror for himself.  The anguish he had exhibited on the moor subsided\nas soon as ever he entered Wuthering Heights; so I guessed he had been\nmenaced with an awful visitation of wrath if he failed in decoying us\nthere; and, that accomplished, he had no further immediate fears.\n\n'Papa wants us to be married,' he continued, after sipping some of the\nliquid.  'And he knows your papa wouldn't let us marry now; and he's\nafraid of my dying if we wait; so we are to be married in the morning,\nand you are to stay here all night; and, if you do as he wishes, you\nshall return home next day, and take me with you.'\n\n'Take you with her, pitiful changeling!' I exclaimed.  '_You_ marry?  Why,\nthe man is mad! or he thinks us fools, every one.  And do you imagine\nthat beautiful young lady, that healthy, hearty girl, will tie herself to\na little perishing monkey like you?  Are you cherishing the notion that\nanybody, let alone Miss Catherine Linton, would have you for a husband?\nYou want whipping for bringing us in here at all, with your dastardly\npuling tricks: and--don't look so silly, now!  I've a very good mind to\nshake you severely, for your contemptible treachery, and your imbecile\nconceit.'\n\nI did give him a slight shaking; but it brought on the cough, and he took\nto his ordinary resource of moaning and weeping, and Catherine rebuked\nme.\n\n'Stay all night?  No,' she said, looking slowly round.  'Ellen, I'll burn\nthat door down but I'll get out.'\n\nAnd she would have commenced the execution of her threat directly, but\nLinton was up in alarm for his dear self again.  He clasped her in his\ntwo feeble arms sobbing:--'Won't you have me, and save me? not let me\ncome to the Grange?  Oh, darling Catherine! you mustn't go and leave,\nafter all.  You _must_ obey my father--you _must_!'\n\n'I must obey my own,' she replied, 'and relieve him from this cruel\nsuspense.  The whole night!  What would he think?  He'll be distressed\nalready.  I'll either break or burn a way out of the house.  Be quiet!\nYou're in no danger; but if you hinder me--Linton, I love papa better\nthan you!'  The mortal terror he felt of Mr. Heathcliff's anger restored\nto the boy his coward's eloquence.  Catherine was near distraught: still,\nshe persisted that she must go home, and tried entreaty in her turn,\npersuading him to subdue his selfish agony.  While they were thus\noccupied, our jailor re-entered.\n\n'Your beasts have trotted off,' he said, 'and--now Linton! snivelling\nagain?  What has she been doing to you?  Come, come--have done, and get\nto bed.  In a month or two, my lad, you'll be able to pay her back her\npresent tyrannies with a vigorous hand.  You're pining for pure love, are\nyou not? nothing else in the world: and she shall have you!  There, to\nbed!  Zillah won't be here to-night; you must undress yourself.  Hush!\nhold your noise!  Once in your own room, I'll not come near you: you\nneedn't fear.  By chance, you've managed tolerably.  I'll look to the\nrest.'\n\nHe spoke these words, holding the door open for his son to pass, and the\nlatter achieved his exit exactly as a spaniel might which suspected the\nperson who attended on it of designing a spiteful squeeze.  The lock was\nre-secured.  Heathcliff approached the fire, where my mistress and I\nstood silent.  Catherine looked up, and instinctively raised her hand to\nher cheek: his neighbourhood revived a painful sensation.  Anybody else\nwould have been incapable of regarding the childish act with sternness,\nbut he scowled on her and muttered--'Oh! you are not afraid of me?  Your\ncourage is well disguised: you seem damnably afraid!'\n\n'I _am_ afraid now,' she replied, 'because, if I stay, papa will be\nmiserable: and how can I endure making him miserable--when he--when\nhe--Mr. Heathcliff, let _me_ go home!  I promise to marry Linton: papa\nwould like me to: and I love him.  Why should you wish to force me to do\nwhat I'll willingly do of myself?'\n\n'Let him dare to force you,' I cried.  'There's law in the land, thank\nGod! there is; though we be in an out-of-the-way place.  I'd inform if he\nwere my own son: and it's felony without benefit of clergy!'\n\n'Silence!' said the ruffian.  'To the devil with your clamour!  I don't\nwant _you_ to speak.  Miss Linton, I shall enjoy myself remarkably in\nthinking your father will be miserable: I shall not sleep for\nsatisfaction.  You could have hit on no surer way of fixing your\nresidence under my roof for the next twenty-four hours than informing me\nthat such an event would follow.  As to your promise to marry Linton,\nI'll take care you shall keep it; for you shall not quit this place till\nit is fulfilled.'\n\n'Send Ellen, then, to let papa know I'm safe!' exclaimed Catherine,\nweeping bitterly.  'Or marry me now.  Poor papa!  Ellen, he'll think\nwe're lost.  What shall we do?'\n\n'Not he!  He'll think you are tired of waiting on him, and run off for a\nlittle amusement,' answered Heathcliff.  'You cannot deny that you\nentered my house of your own accord, in contempt of his injunctions to\nthe contrary.  And it is quite natural that you should desire amusement\nat your age; and that you would weary of nursing a sick man, and that man\n_only_ your father.  Catherine, his happiest days were over when your\ndays began.  He cursed you, I dare say, for coming into the world (I did,\nat least); and it would just do if he cursed you as _he_ went out of it.\nI'd join him.  I don't love you!  How should I?  Weep away.  As far as I\ncan see, it will be your chief diversion hereafter; unless Linton make\namends for other losses: and your provident parent appears to fancy he\nmay.  His letters of advice and consolation entertained me vastly.  In\nhis last he recommended my jewel to be careful of his; and kind to her\nwhen he got her.  Careful and kind--that's paternal.  But Linton requires\nhis whole stock of care and kindness for himself.  Linton can play the\nlittle tyrant well.  He'll undertake to torture any number of cats, if\ntheir teeth be drawn and their claws pared.  You'll be able to tell his\nuncle fine tales of his _kindness_, when you get home again, I assure\nyou.'\n\n'You're right there!' I said; 'explain your son's character.  Show his\nresemblance to yourself: and then, I hope, Miss Cathy will think twice\nbefore she takes the cockatrice!'\n\n'I don't much mind speaking of his amiable qualities now,' he answered;\n'because she must either accept him or remain a prisoner, and you along\nwith her, till your master dies.  I can detain you both, quite concealed,\nhere.  If you doubt, encourage her to retract her word, and you'll have\nan opportunity of judging!'\n\n'I'll not retract my word,' said Catherine.  'I'll marry him within this\nhour, if I may go to Thrushcross Grange afterwards.  Mr. Heathcliff,\nyou're a cruel man, but you're not a fiend; and you won't, from _mere_\nmalice, destroy irrevocably all my happiness.  If papa thought I had left\nhim on purpose, and if he died before I returned, could I bear to live?\nI've given over crying: but I'm going to kneel here, at your knee; and\nI'll not get up, and I'll not take my eyes from your face till you look\nback at me!  No, don't turn away! _do look_! you'll see nothing to\nprovoke you.  I don't hate you.  I'm not angry that you struck me.  Have\nyou never loved _anybody_ in all your life, uncle? _never_?  Ah! you must\nlook once.  I'm so wretched, you can't help being sorry and pitying me.'\n\n'Keep your eft's fingers off; and move, or I'll kick you!' cried\nHeathcliff, brutally repulsing her.  'I'd rather be hugged by a snake.\nHow the devil can you dream of fawning on me?  I _detest_ you!'\n\nHe shrugged his shoulders: shook himself, indeed, as if his flesh crept\nwith aversion; and thrust back his chair; while I got up, and opened my\nmouth, to commence a downright torrent of abuse.  But I was rendered dumb\nin the middle of the first sentence, by a threat that I should be shown\ninto a room by myself the very next syllable I uttered.  It was growing\ndark--we heard a sound of voices at the garden-gate.  Our host hurried\nout instantly: _he_ had his wits about him; _we_ had not.  There was a\ntalk of two or three minutes, and he returned alone.\n\n'I thought it had been your cousin Hareton,' I observed to Catherine.  'I\nwish he would arrive!  Who knows but he might take our part?'\n\n'It was three servants sent to seek you from the Grange,' said\nHeathcliff, overhearing me.  'You should have opened a lattice and called\nout: but I could swear that chit is glad you didn't.  She's glad to be\nobliged to stay, I'm certain.'\n\nAt learning the chance we had missed, we both gave vent to our grief\nwithout control; and he allowed us to wail on till nine o'clock.  Then he\nbid us go upstairs, through the kitchen, to Zillah's chamber; and I\nwhispered my companion to obey: perhaps we might contrive to get through\nthe window there, or into a garret, and out by its skylight.  The window,\nhowever, was narrow, like those below, and the garret trap was safe from\nour attempts; for we were fastened in as before.  We neither of us lay\ndown: Catherine took her station by the lattice, and watched anxiously\nfor morning; a deep sigh being the only answer I could obtain to my\nfrequent entreaties that she would try to rest.  I seated myself in a\nchair, and rocked to and fro, passing harsh judgment on my many\nderelictions of duty; from which, it struck me then, all the misfortunes\nof my employers sprang.  It was not the case, in reality, I am aware; but\nit was, in my imagination, that dismal night; and I thought Heathcliff\nhimself less guilty than I.\n\nAt seven o'clock he came, and inquired if Miss Linton had risen.  She ran\nto the door immediately, and answered, 'Yes.'  'Here, then,' he said,\nopening it, and pulling her out.  I rose to follow, but he turned the\nlock again.  I demanded my release.\n\n'Be patient,' he replied; 'I'll send up your breakfast in a while.'\n\nI thumped on the panels, and rattled the latch angrily and Catherine\nasked why I was still shut up?  He answered, I must try to endure it\nanother hour, and they went away.  I endured it two or three hours; at\nlength, I heard a footstep: not Heathcliff's.\n\n'I've brought you something to eat,' said a voice; 'oppen t' door!'\n\nComplying eagerly, I beheld Hareton, laden with food enough to last me\nall day.\n\n'Tak' it,' he added, thrusting the tray into my hand.\n\n'Stay one minute,' I began.\n\n'Nay,' cried he, and retired, regardless of any prayers I could pour\nforth to detain him.\n\nAnd there I remained enclosed the whole day, and the whole of the next\nnight; and another, and another.  Five nights and four days I remained,\naltogether, seeing nobody but Hareton once every morning; and he was a\nmodel of a jailor: surly, and dumb, and deaf to every attempt at moving\nhis sense of justice or compassion.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVIII\n\n\nOn the fifth morning, or rather afternoon, a different step\napproached--lighter and shorter; and, this time, the person entered the\nroom.  It was Zillah; donned in her scarlet shawl, with a black silk\nbonnet on her head, and a willow-basket swung to her arm.\n\n'Eh, dear!  Mrs. Dean!' she exclaimed.  'Well! there is a talk about you\nat Gimmerton.  I never thought but you were sunk in the Blackhorse marsh,\nand missy with you, till master told me you'd been found, and he'd lodged\nyou here!  What! and you must have got on an island, sure?  And how long\nwere you in the hole?  Did master save you, Mrs. Dean?  But you're not so\nthin--you've not been so poorly, have you?'\n\n'Your master is a true scoundrel!' I replied.  'But he shall answer for\nit.  He needn't have raised that tale: it shall all be laid bare!'\n\n'What do you mean?' asked Zillah.  'It's not his tale: they tell that in\nthe village--about your being lost in the marsh; and I calls to Earnshaw,\nwhen I come in--\"Eh, they's queer things, Mr. Hareton, happened since I\nwent off.  It's a sad pity of that likely young lass, and cant Nelly\nDean.\"  He stared.  I thought he had not heard aught, so I told him the\nrumour.  The master listened, and he just smiled to himself, and said,\n\"If they have been in the marsh, they are out now, Zillah.  Nelly Dean is\nlodged, at this minute, in your room.  You can tell her to flit, when you\ngo up; here is the key.  The bog-water got into her head, and she would\nhave run home quite flighty; but I fixed her till she came round to her\nsenses.  You can bid her go to the Grange at once, if she be able, and\ncarry a message from me, that her young lady will follow in time to\nattend the squire's funeral.\"'\n\n'Mr. Edgar is not dead?' I gasped.  'Oh! Zillah, Zillah!'\n\n'No, no; sit you down, my good mistress,' she replied; 'you're right\nsickly yet.  He's not dead; Doctor Kenneth thinks he may last another\nday.  I met him on the road and asked.'\n\nInstead of sitting down, I snatched my outdoor things, and hastened\nbelow, for the way was free.  On entering the house, I looked about for\nsome one to give information of Catherine.  The place was filled with\nsunshine, and the door stood wide open; but nobody seemed at hand.  As I\nhesitated whether to go off at once, or return and seek my mistress, a\nslight cough drew my attention to the hearth.  Linton lay on the settle,\nsole tenant, sucking a stick of sugar-candy, and pursuing my movements\nwith apathetic eyes.  'Where is Miss Catherine?' I demanded sternly,\nsupposing I could frighten him into giving intelligence, by catching him\nthus, alone.  He sucked on like an innocent.\n\n'Is she gone?' I said.\n\n'No,' he replied; 'she's upstairs: she's not to go; we won't let her.'\n\n'You won't let her, little idiot!' I exclaimed.  'Direct me to her room\nimmediately, or I'll make you sing out sharply.'\n\n'Papa would make you sing out, if you attempted to get there,' he\nanswered.  'He says I'm not to be soft with Catherine: she's my wife, and\nit's shameful that she should wish to leave me.  He says she hates me and\nwants me to die, that she may have my money; but she shan't have it: and\nshe shan't go home!  She never shall!--she may cry, and be sick as much\nas she pleases!'\n\nHe resumed his former occupation, closing his lids, as if he meant to\ndrop asleep.\n\n'Master Heathcliff,' I resumed, 'have you forgotten all Catherine's\nkindness to you last winter, when you affirmed you loved her, and when\nshe brought you books and sung you songs, and came many a time through\nwind and snow to see you?  She wept to miss one evening, because you\nwould be disappointed; and you felt then that she was a hundred times too\ngood to you: and now you believe the lies your father tells, though you\nknow he detests you both.  And you join him against her.  That's fine\ngratitude, is it not?'\n\nThe corner of Linton's mouth fell, and he took the sugar-candy from his\nlips.\n\n'Did she come to Wuthering Heights because she hated you?' I continued.\n'Think for yourself!  As to your money, she does not even know that you\nwill have any.  And you say she's sick; and yet you leave her alone, up\nthere in a strange house!  You who have felt what it is to be so\nneglected!  You could pity your own sufferings; and she pitied them, too;\nbut you won't pity hers!  I shed tears, Master Heathcliff, you see--an\nelderly woman, and a servant merely--and you, after pretending such\naffection, and having reason to worship her almost, store every tear you\nhave for yourself, and lie there quite at ease.  Ah! you're a heartless,\nselfish boy!'\n\n'I can't stay with her,' he answered crossly.  'I'll not stay by myself.\nShe cries so I can't bear it.  And she won't give over, though I say I'll\ncall my father.  I did call him once, and he threatened to strangle her\nif she was not quiet; but she began again the instant he left the room,\nmoaning and grieving all night long, though I screamed for vexation that\nI couldn't sleep.'\n\n'Is Mr. Heathcliff out?' I inquired, perceiving that the wretched\ncreature had no power to sympathize with his cousin's mental tortures.\n\n'He's in the court,' he replied, 'talking to Doctor Kenneth; who says\nuncle is dying, truly, at last.  I'm glad, for I shall be master of the\nGrange after him.  Catherine always spoke of it as her house.  It isn't\nhers!  It's mine: papa says everything she has is mine.  All her nice\nbooks are mine; she offered to give me them, and her pretty birds, and\nher pony Minny, if I would get the key of our room, and let her out; but\nI told her she had nothing to give, they were all, all mine.  And then\nshe cried, and took a little picture from her neck, and said I should\nhave that; two pictures in a gold case, on one side her mother, and on\nthe other uncle, when they were young.  That was yesterday--I said they\nwere mine, too; and tried to get them from her.  The spiteful thing\nwouldn't let me: she pushed me off, and hurt me.  I shrieked out--that\nfrightens her--she heard papa coming, and she broke the hinges and\ndivided the case, and gave me her mother's portrait; the other she\nattempted to hide: but papa asked what was the matter, and I explained\nit.  He took the one I had away, and ordered her to resign hers to me;\nshe refused, and he--he struck her down, and wrenched it off the chain,\nand crushed it with his foot.'\n\n'And were you pleased to see her struck?' I asked: having my designs in\nencouraging his talk.\n\n'I winked,' he answered: 'I wink to see my father strike a dog or a\nhorse, he does it so hard.  Yet I was glad at first--she deserved\npunishing for pushing me: but when papa was gone, she made me come to the\nwindow and showed me her cheek cut on the inside, against her teeth, and\nher mouth filling with blood; and then she gathered up the bits of the\npicture, and went and sat down with her face to the wall, and she has\nnever spoken to me since: and I sometimes think she can't speak for pain.\nI don't like to think so; but she's a naughty thing for crying\ncontinually; and she looks so pale and wild, I'm afraid of her.'\n\n'And you can get the key if you choose?' I said.\n\n'Yes, when I am up-stairs,' he answered; 'but I can't walk up-stairs\nnow.'\n\n'In what apartment is it?' I asked.\n\n'Oh,' he cried, 'I shan't tell _you_ where it is.  It is our secret.\nNobody, neither Hareton nor Zillah, is to know.  There! you've tired\nme--go away, go away!'  And he turned his face on to his arm, and shut\nhis eyes again.\n\nI considered it best to depart without seeing Mr. Heathcliff, and bring a\nrescue for my young lady from the Grange.  On reaching it, the\nastonishment of my fellow-servants to see me, and their joy also, was\nintense; and when they heard that their little mistress was safe, two or\nthree were about to hurry up and shout the news at Mr. Edgar's door: but\nI bespoke the announcement of it myself.  How changed I found him, even\nin those few days!  He lay an image of sadness and resignation awaiting\nhis death.  Very young he looked: though his actual age was thirty-nine,\none would have called him ten years younger, at least.  He thought of\nCatherine; for he murmured her name.  I touched his hand, and spoke.\n\n'Catherine is coming, dear master!' I whispered; 'she is alive and well;\nand will be here, I hope, to-night.'\n\nI trembled at the first effects of this intelligence: he half rose up,\nlooked eagerly round the apartment, and then sank back in a swoon.  As\nsoon as he recovered, I related our compulsory visit, and detention at\nthe Heights.  I said Heathcliff forced me to go in: which was not quite\ntrue.  I uttered as little as possible against Linton; nor did I describe\nall his father's brutal conduct--my intentions being to add no\nbitterness, if I could help it, to his already over-flowing cup.\n\nHe divined that one of his enemy's purposes was to secure the personal\nproperty, as well as the estate, to his son: or rather himself; yet why\nhe did not wait till his decease was a puzzle to my master, because\nignorant how nearly he and his nephew would quit the world together.\nHowever, he felt that his will had better be altered: instead of leaving\nCatherine's fortune at her own disposal, he determined to put it in the\nhands of trustees for her use during life, and for her children, if she\nhad any, after her.  By that means, it could not fall to Mr. Heathcliff\nshould Linton die.\n\nHaving received his orders, I despatched a man to fetch the attorney, and\nfour more, provided with serviceable weapons, to demand my young lady of\nher jailor.  Both parties were delayed very late.  The single servant\nreturned first.  He said Mr. Green, the lawyer, was out when he arrived\nat his house, and he had to wait two hours for his re-entrance; and then\nMr. Green told him he had a little business in the village that must be\ndone; but he would be at Thrushcross Grange before morning.  The four men\ncame back unaccompanied also.  They brought word that Catherine was ill:\ntoo ill to quit her room; and Heathcliff would not suffer them to see\nher.  I scolded the stupid fellows well for listening to that tale, which\nI would not carry to my master; resolving to take a whole bevy up to the\nHeights, at day-light, and storm it literally, unless the prisoner were\nquietly surrendered to us.  Her father _shall_ see her, I vowed, and\nvowed again, if that devil be killed on his own doorstones in trying to\nprevent it!\n\nHappily, I was spared the journey and the trouble.  I had gone\ndown-stairs at three o'clock to fetch a jug of water; and was passing\nthrough the hall with it in my hand, when a sharp knock at the front door\nmade me jump.  'Oh! it is Green,' I said, recollecting myself--'only\nGreen,' and I went on, intending to send somebody else to open it; but\nthe knock was repeated: not loud, and still importunately.  I put the jug\non the banister and hastened to admit him myself.  The harvest moon shone\nclear outside.  It was not the attorney.  My own sweet little mistress\nsprang on my neck sobbing, 'Ellen, Ellen!  Is papa alive?'\n\n'Yes,' I cried: 'yes, my angel, he is, God be thanked, you are safe with\nus again!'\n\nShe wanted to run, breathless as she was, up-stairs to Mr. Linton's room;\nbut I compelled her to sit down on a chair, and made her drink, and\nwashed her pale face, chafing it into a faint colour with my apron.  Then\nI said I must go first, and tell of her arrival; imploring her to say,\nshe should be happy with young Heathcliff.  She stared, but soon\ncomprehending why I counselled her to utter the falsehood, she assured me\nshe would not complain.\n\nI couldn't abide to be present at their meeting.  I stood outside the\nchamber-door a quarter of an hour, and hardly ventured near the bed,\nthen.  All was composed, however: Catherine's despair was as silent as\nher father's joy.  She supported him calmly, in appearance; and he fixed\non her features his raised eyes that seemed dilating with ecstasy.\n\nHe died blissfully, Mr. Lockwood: he died so.  Kissing her cheek, he\nmurmured,--'I am going to her; and you, darling child, shall come to us!'\nand never stirred or spoke again; but continued that rapt, radiant gaze,\ntill his pulse imperceptibly stopped and his soul departed.  None could\nhave noticed the exact minute of his death, it was so entirely without a\nstruggle.\n\nWhether Catherine had spent her tears, or whether the grief were too\nweighty to let them flow, she sat there dry-eyed till the sun rose: she\nsat till noon, and would still have remained brooding over that deathbed,\nbut I insisted on her coming away and taking some repose.  It was well I\nsucceeded in removing her, for at dinner-time appeared the lawyer, having\ncalled at Wuthering Heights to get his instructions how to behave.  He\nhad sold himself to Mr. Heathcliff: that was the cause of his delay in\nobeying my master's summons.  Fortunately, no thought of worldly affairs\ncrossed the latter's mind, to disturb him, after his daughter's arrival.\n\nMr. Green took upon himself to order everything and everybody about the\nplace.  He gave all the servants but me, notice to quit.  He would have\ncarried his delegated authority to the point of insisting that Edgar\nLinton should not be buried beside his wife, but in the chapel, with his\nfamily.  There was the will, however, to hinder that, and my loud\nprotestations against any infringement of its directions.  The funeral\nwas hurried over; Catherine, Mrs. Linton Heathcliff now, was suffered to\nstay at the Grange till her father's corpse had quitted it.\n\nShe told me that her anguish had at last spurred Linton to incur the risk\nof liberating her.  She heard the men I sent disputing at the door, and\nshe gathered the sense of Heathcliff's answer.  It drove her desperate.\nLinton who had been conveyed up to the little parlour soon after I left,\nwas terrified into fetching the key before his father re-ascended.  He\nhad the cunning to unlock and re-lock the door, without shutting it; and\nwhen he should have gone to bed, he begged to sleep with Hareton, and his\npetition was granted for once.  Catherine stole out before break of day.\nShe dared not try the doors lest the dogs should raise an alarm; she\nvisited the empty chambers and examined their windows; and, luckily,\nlighting on her mother's, she got easily out of its lattice, and on to\nthe ground, by means of the fir-tree close by.  Her accomplice suffered\nfor his share in the escape, notwithstanding his timid contrivances.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIX\n\n\nThe evening after the funeral, my young lady and I were seated in the\nlibrary; now musing mournfully--one of us despairingly--on our loss, now\nventuring conjectures as to the gloomy future.\n\nWe had just agreed the best destiny which could await Catherine would be\na permission to continue resident at the Grange; at least during Linton's\nlife: he being allowed to join her there, and I to remain as housekeeper.\nThat seemed rather too favourable an arrangement to be hoped for; and yet\nI did hope, and began to cheer up under the prospect of retaining my home\nand my employment, and, above all, my beloved young mistress; when a\nservant--one of the discarded ones, not yet departed--rushed hastily in,\nand said 'that devil Heathcliff' was coming through the court: should he\nfasten the door in his face?\n\nIf we had been mad enough to order that proceeding, we had not time.  He\nmade no ceremony of knocking or announcing his name: he was master, and\navailed himself of the master's privilege to walk straight in, without\nsaying a word.  The sound of our informant's voice directed him to the\nlibrary; he entered and motioning him out, shut the door.\n\nIt was the same room into which he had been ushered, as a guest, eighteen\nyears before: the same moon shone through the window; and the same autumn\nlandscape lay outside.  We had not yet lighted a candle, but all the\napartment was visible, even to the portraits on the wall: the splendid\nhead of Mrs. Linton, and the graceful one of her husband.  Heathcliff\nadvanced to the hearth.  Time had little altered his person either.  There\nwas the same man: his dark face rather sallower and more composed, his\nframe a stone or two heavier, perhaps, and no other difference.  Catherine\nhad risen with an impulse to dash out, when she saw him.\n\n'Stop!' he said, arresting her by the arm.  'No more runnings away!  Where\nwould you go?  I'm come to fetch you home; and I hope you'll be a dutiful\ndaughter and not encourage my son to further disobedience.  I was\nembarrassed how to punish him when I discovered his part in the business:\nhe's such a cobweb, a pinch would annihilate him; but you'll see by his\nlook that he has received his due!  I brought him down one evening, the\nday before yesterday, and just set him in a chair, and never touched him\nafterwards.  I sent Hareton out, and we had the room to ourselves.  In\ntwo hours, I called Joseph to carry him up again; and since then my\npresence is as potent on his nerves as a ghost; and I fancy he sees me\noften, though I am not near.  Hareton says he wakes and shrieks in the\nnight by the hour together, and calls you to protect him from me; and,\nwhether you like your precious mate, or not, you must come: he's your\nconcern now; I yield all my interest in him to you.'\n\n'Why not let Catherine continue here,' I pleaded, 'and send Master Linton\nto her?  As you hate them both, you'd not miss them: they can only be a\ndaily plague to your unnatural heart.'\n\n'I'm seeking a tenant for the Grange,' he answered; 'and I want my\nchildren about me, to be sure.  Besides, that lass owes me her services\nfor her bread.  I'm not going to nurture her in luxury and idleness after\nLinton is gone.  Make haste and get ready, now; and don't oblige me to\ncompel you.'\n\n'I shall,' said Catherine.  'Linton is all I have to love in the world,\nand though you have done what you could to make him hateful to me, and me\nto him, you cannot make us hate each other.  And I defy you to hurt him\nwhen I am by, and I defy you to frighten me!'\n\n'You are a boastful champion,' replied Heathcliff; 'but I don't like you\nwell enough to hurt him: you shall get the full benefit of the torment,\nas long as it lasts.  It is not I who will make him hateful to you--it is\nhis own sweet spirit.  He's as bitter as gall at your desertion and its\nconsequences: don't expect thanks for this noble devotion.  I heard him\ndraw a pleasant picture to Zillah of what he would do if he were as\nstrong as I: the inclination is there, and his very weakness will sharpen\nhis wits to find a substitute for strength.'\n\n'I know he has a bad nature,' said Catherine: 'he's your son.  But I'm\nglad I've a better, to forgive it; and I know he loves me, and for that\nreason I love him.  Mr. Heathcliff _you_ have _nobody_ to love you; and,\nhowever miserable you make us, we shall still have the revenge of\nthinking that your cruelty arises from your greater misery.  You _are_\nmiserable, are you not?  Lonely, like the devil, and envious like him?\n_Nobody_ loves you--_nobody_ will cry for you when you die!  I wouldn't\nbe you!'\n\nCatherine spoke with a kind of dreary triumph: she seemed to have made up\nher mind to enter into the spirit of her future family, and draw pleasure\nfrom the griefs of her enemies.\n\n'You shall be sorry to be yourself presently,' said her father-in-law,\n'if you stand there another minute.  Begone, witch, and get your things!'\n\nShe scornfully withdrew.  In her absence I began to beg for Zillah's\nplace at the Heights, offering to resign mine to her; but he would suffer\nit on no account.  He bid me be silent; and then, for the first time,\nallowed himself a glance round the room and a look at the pictures.\nHaving studied Mrs. Linton's, he said--'I shall have that home.  Not\nbecause I need it, but--'  He turned abruptly to the fire, and continued,\nwith what, for lack of a better word, I must call a smile--'I'll tell you\nwhat I did yesterday!  I got the sexton, who was digging Linton's grave,\nto remove the earth off her coffin lid, and I opened it.  I thought,\nonce, I would have stayed there: when I saw her face again--it is hers\nyet!--he had hard work to stir me; but he said it would change if the air\nblew on it, and so I struck one side of the coffin loose, and covered it\nup: not Linton's side, damn him!  I wish he'd been soldered in lead.  And\nI bribed the sexton to pull it away when I'm laid there, and slide mine\nout too; I'll have it made so: and then by the time Linton gets to us\nhe'll not know which is which!'\n\n'You were very wicked, Mr. Heathcliff!' I exclaimed; 'were you not\nashamed to disturb the dead?'\n\n'I disturbed nobody, Nelly,' he replied; 'and I gave some ease to myself.\nI shall be a great deal more comfortable now; and you'll have a better\nchance of keeping me underground, when I get there.  Disturbed her?  No!\nshe has disturbed me, night and day, through eighteen\nyears--incessantly--remorselessly--till yesternight; and yesternight I\nwas tranquil.  I dreamt I was sleeping the last sleep by that sleeper,\nwith my heart stopped and my cheek frozen against hers.'\n\n'And if she had been dissolved into earth, or worse, what would you have\ndreamt of then?' I said.\n\n'Of dissolving with her, and being more happy still!' he answered.  'Do\nyou suppose I dread any change of that sort?  I expected such a\ntransformation on raising the lid--but I'm better pleased that it should\nnot commence till I share it.  Besides, unless I had received a distinct\nimpression of her passionless features, that strange feeling would hardly\nhave been removed.  It began oddly.  You know I was wild after she died;\nand eternally, from dawn to dawn, praying her to return to me her spirit!\nI have a strong faith in ghosts: I have a conviction that they can, and\ndo, exist among us!  The day she was buried, there came a fall of snow.\nIn the evening I went to the churchyard.  It blew bleak as winter--all\nround was solitary.  I didn't fear that her fool of a husband would\nwander up the glen so late; and no one else had business to bring them\nthere.  Being alone, and conscious two yards of loose earth was the sole\nbarrier between us, I said to myself--\"I'll have her in my arms again!  If\nshe be cold, I'll think it is this north wind that chills _me_; and if\nshe be motionless, it is sleep.\"  I got a spade from the tool-house, and\nbegan to delve with all my might--it scraped the coffin; I fell to work\nwith my hands; the wood commenced cracking about the screws; I was on the\npoint of attaining my object, when it seemed that I heard a sigh from\nsome one above, close at the edge of the grave, and bending down.  \"If I\ncan only get this off,\" I muttered, \"I wish they may shovel in the earth\nover us both!\" and I wrenched at it more desperately still.  There was\nanother sigh, close at my ear.  I appeared to feel the warm breath of it\ndisplacing the sleet-laden wind.  I knew no living thing in flesh and\nblood was by; but, as certainly as you perceive the approach to some\nsubstantial body in the dark, though it cannot be discerned, so certainly\nI felt that Cathy was there: not under me, but on the earth.  A sudden\nsense of relief flowed from my heart through every limb.  I relinquished\nmy labour of agony, and turned consoled at once: unspeakably consoled.\nHer presence was with me: it remained while I re-filled the grave, and\nled me home.  You may laugh, if you will; but I was sure I should see her\nthere.  I was sure she was with me, and I could not help talking to her.\nHaving reached the Heights, I rushed eagerly to the door.  It was\nfastened; and, I remember, that accursed Earnshaw and my wife opposed my\nentrance.  I remember stopping to kick the breath out of him, and then\nhurrying up-stairs, to my room and hers.  I looked round impatiently--I\nfelt her by me--I could _almost_ see her, and yet I _could not_!  I ought\nto have sweat blood then, from the anguish of my yearning--from the\nfervour of my supplications to have but one glimpse!  I had not one.  She\nshowed herself, as she often was in life, a devil to me!  And, since\nthen, sometimes more and sometimes less, I've been the sport of that\nintolerable torture!  Infernal! keeping my nerves at such a stretch that,\nif they had not resembled catgut, they would long ago have relaxed to the\nfeebleness of Linton's.  When I sat in the house with Hareton, it seemed\nthat on going out I should meet her; when I walked on the moors I should\nmeet her coming in.  When I went from home I hastened to return; she\n_must_ be somewhere at the Heights, I was certain!  And when I slept in\nher chamber--I was beaten out of that.  I couldn't lie there; for the\nmoment I closed my eyes, she was either outside the window, or sliding\nback the panels, or entering the room, or even resting her darling head\non the same pillow as she did when a child; and I must open my lids to\nsee.  And so I opened and closed them a hundred times a night--to be\nalways disappointed!  It racked me!  I've often groaned aloud, till that\nold rascal Joseph no doubt believed that my conscience was playing the\nfiend inside of me.  Now, since I've seen her, I'm pacified--a little.  It\nwas a strange way of killing: not by inches, but by fractions of\nhairbreadths, to beguile me with the spectre of a hope through eighteen\nyears!'\n\nMr. Heathcliff paused and wiped his forehead; his hair clung to it, wet\nwith perspiration; his eyes were fixed on the red embers of the fire, the\nbrows not contracted, but raised next the temples; diminishing the grim\naspect of his countenance, but imparting a peculiar look of trouble, and\na painful appearance of mental tension towards one absorbing subject.  He\nonly half addressed me, and I maintained silence.  I didn't like to hear\nhim talk!  After a short period he resumed his meditation on the picture,\ntook it down and leant it against the sofa to contemplate it at better\nadvantage; and while so occupied Catherine entered, announcing that she\nwas ready, when her pony should be saddled.\n\n'Send that over to-morrow,' said Heathcliff to me; then turning to her,\nhe added: 'You may do without your pony: it is a fine evening, and you'll\nneed no ponies at Wuthering Heights; for what journeys you take, your own\nfeet will serve you.  Come along.'\n\n'Good-bye, Ellen!' whispered my dear little mistress.\n\nAs she kissed me, her lips felt like ice.  'Come and see me, Ellen; don't\nforget.'\n\n'Take care you do no such thing, Mrs. Dean!' said her new father.  'When\nI wish to speak to you I'll come here.  I want none of your prying at my\nhouse!'\n\nHe signed her to precede him; and casting back a look that cut my heart,\nshe obeyed.  I watched them, from the window, walk down the garden.\nHeathcliff fixed Catherine's arm under his: though she disputed the act\nat first evidently; and with rapid strides he hurried her into the alley,\nwhose trees concealed them.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXX\n\n\nI have paid a visit to the Heights, but I have not seen her since she\nleft: Joseph held the door in his hand when I called to ask after her,\nand wouldn't let me pass.  He said Mrs. Linton was 'thrang,' and the\nmaster was not in.  Zillah has told me something of the way they go on,\notherwise I should hardly know who was dead and who living.  She thinks\nCatherine haughty, and does not like her, I can guess by her talk.  My\nyoung lady asked some aid of her when she first came; but Mr. Heathcliff\ntold her to follow her own business, and let his daughter-in-law look\nafter herself; and Zillah willingly acquiesced, being a narrow-minded,\nselfish woman.  Catherine evinced a child's annoyance at this neglect;\nrepaid it with contempt, and thus enlisted my informant among her\nenemies, as securely as if she had done her some great wrong.  I had a\nlong talk with Zillah about six weeks ago, a little before you came, one\nday when we foregathered on the moor; and this is what she told me.\n\n'The first thing Mrs. Linton did,' she said, 'on her arrival at the\nHeights, was to run up-stairs, without even wishing good-evening to me\nand Joseph; she shut herself into Linton's room, and remained till\nmorning.  Then, while the master and Earnshaw were at breakfast, she\nentered the house, and asked all in a quiver if the doctor might be sent\nfor? her cousin was very ill.\n\n'\"We know that!\" answered Heathcliff; \"but his life is not worth a\nfarthing, and I won't spend a farthing on him.\"\n\n'\"But I cannot tell how to do,\" she said; \"and if nobody will help me,\nhe'll die!\"\n\n'\"Walk out of the room,\" cried the master, \"and let me never hear a word\nmore about him!  None here care what becomes of him; if you do, act the\nnurse; if you do not, lock him up and leave him.\"\n\n'Then she began to bother me, and I said I'd had enough plague with the\ntiresome thing; we each had our tasks, and hers was to wait on Linton:\nMr. Heathcliff bid me leave that labour to her.\n\n'How they managed together, I can't tell.  I fancy he fretted a great\ndeal, and moaned hisseln night and day; and she had precious little rest:\none could guess by her white face and heavy eyes.  She sometimes came\ninto the kitchen all wildered like, and looked as if she would fain beg\nassistance; but I was not going to disobey the master: I never dare\ndisobey him, Mrs. Dean; and, though I thought it wrong that Kenneth\nshould not be sent for, it was no concern of mine either to advise or\ncomplain, and I always refused to meddle.  Once or twice, after we had\ngone to bed, I've happened to open my door again and seen her sitting\ncrying on the stairs'-top; and then I've shut myself in quick, for fear\nof being moved to interfere.  I did pity her then, I'm sure: still I\ndidn't wish to lose my place, you know.\n\n'At last, one night she came boldly into my chamber, and frightened me\nout of my wits, by saying, \"Tell Mr. Heathcliff that his son is dying--I'm\nsure he is, this time.  Get up, instantly, and tell him.\"\n\n'Having uttered this speech, she vanished again.  I lay a quarter of an\nhour listening and trembling.  Nothing stirred--the house was quiet.\n\n'She's mistaken, I said to myself.  He's got over it.  I needn't disturb\nthem; and I began to doze.  But my sleep was marred a second time by a\nsharp ringing of the bell--the only bell we have, put up on purpose for\nLinton; and the master called to me to see what was the matter, and\ninform them that he wouldn't have that noise repeated.\n\n'I delivered Catherine's message.  He cursed to himself, and in a few\nminutes came out with a lighted candle, and proceeded to their room.  I\nfollowed.  Mrs. Heathcliff was seated by the bedside, with her hands\nfolded on her knees.  Her father-in-law went up, held the light to\nLinton's face, looked at him, and touched him; afterwards he turned to\nher.\n\n'\"Now--Catherine,\" he said, \"how do you feel?\"\n\n'She was dumb.\n\n'\"How do you feel, Catherine?\" he repeated.\n\n'\"He's safe, and I'm free,\" she answered: \"I should feel well--but,\" she\ncontinued, with a bitterness she couldn't conceal, \"you have left me so\nlong to struggle against death alone, that I feel and see only death!  I\nfeel like death!\"\n\n'And she looked like it, too!  I gave her a little wine.  Hareton and\nJoseph, who had been wakened by the ringing and the sound of feet, and\nheard our talk from outside, now entered.  Joseph was fain, I believe, of\nthe lad's removal; Hareton seemed a thought bothered: though he was more\ntaken up with staring at Catherine than thinking of Linton.  But the\nmaster bid him get off to bed again: we didn't want his help.  He\nafterwards made Joseph remove the body to his chamber, and told me to\nreturn to mine, and Mrs. Heathcliff remained by herself.\n\n'In the morning, he sent me to tell her she must come down to breakfast:\nshe had undressed, and appeared going to sleep, and said she was ill; at\nwhich I hardly wondered.  I informed Mr. Heathcliff, and he\nreplied,--\"Well, let her be till after the funeral; and go up now and\nthen to get her what is needful; and, as soon as she seems better, tell\nme.\"'\n\nCathy stayed upstairs a fortnight, according to Zillah; who visited her\ntwice a day, and would have been rather more friendly, but her attempts\nat increasing kindness were proudly and promptly repelled.\n\nHeathcliff went up once, to show her Linton's will.  He had bequeathed\nthe whole of his, and what had been her, moveable property, to his\nfather: the poor creature was threatened, or coaxed, into that act during\nher week's absence, when his uncle died.  The lands, being a minor, he\ncould not meddle with.  However, Mr. Heathcliff has claimed and kept them\nin his wife's right and his also: I suppose legally; at any rate,\nCatherine, destitute of cash and friends, cannot disturb his possession.\n\n'Nobody,' said Zillah, 'ever approached her door, except that once, but\nI; and nobody asked anything about her.  The first occasion of her coming\ndown into the house was on a Sunday afternoon.  She had cried out, when I\ncarried up her dinner, that she couldn't bear any longer being in the\ncold; and I told her the master was going to Thrushcross Grange, and\nEarnshaw and I needn't hinder her from descending; so, as soon as she\nheard Heathcliff's horse trot off, she made her appearance, donned in\nblack, and her yellow curls combed back behind her ears as plain as a\nQuaker: she couldn't comb them out.\n\n'Joseph and I generally go to chapel on Sundays:' the kirk, you know, has\nno minister now, explained Mrs. Dean; and they call the Methodists' or\nBaptists' place (I can't say which it is) at Gimmerton, a chapel.  'Joseph\nhad gone,' she continued, 'but I thought proper to bide at home.  Young\nfolks are always the better for an elder's over-looking; and Hareton,\nwith all his bashfulness, isn't a model of nice behaviour.  I let him\nknow that his cousin would very likely sit with us, and she had been\nalways used to see the Sabbath respected; so he had as good leave his\nguns and bits of indoor work alone, while she stayed.  He coloured up at\nthe news, and cast his eyes over his hands and clothes.  The train-oil\nand gunpowder were shoved out of sight in a minute.  I saw he meant to\ngive her his company; and I guessed, by his way, he wanted to be\npresentable; so, laughing, as I durst not laugh when the master is by, I\noffered to help him, if he would, and joked at his confusion.  He grew\nsullen, and began to swear.\n\n'Now, Mrs. Dean,' Zillah went on, seeing me not pleased by her manner,\n'you happen think your young lady too fine for Mr. Hareton; and happen\nyou're right: but I own I should love well to bring her pride a peg\nlower.  And what will all her learning and her daintiness do for her,\nnow?  She's as poor as you or I: poorer, I'll be bound: you're saying,\nand I'm doing my little all that road.'\n\nHareton allowed Zillah to give him her aid; and she flattered him into a\ngood humour; so, when Catherine came, half forgetting her former insults,\nhe tried to make himself agreeable, by the housekeeper's account.\n\n'Missis walked in,' she said, 'as chill as an icicle, and as high as a\nprincess.  I got up and offered her my seat in the arm-chair.  No, she\nturned up her nose at my civility.  Earnshaw rose, too, and bid her come\nto the settle, and sit close by the fire: he was sure she was starved.\n\n'\"I've been starved a month and more,\" she answered, resting on the word\nas scornful as she could.\n\n'And she got a chair for herself, and placed it at a distance from both\nof us.  Having sat till she was warm, she began to look round, and\ndiscovered a number of books on the dresser; she was instantly upon her\nfeet again, stretching to reach them: but they were too high up.  Her\ncousin, after watching her endeavours a while, at last summoned courage\nto help her; she held her frock, and he filled it with the first that\ncame to hand.\n\n'That was a great advance for the lad.  She didn't thank him; still, he\nfelt gratified that she had accepted his assistance, and ventured to\nstand behind as she examined them, and even to stoop and point out what\nstruck his fancy in certain old pictures which they contained; nor was he\ndaunted by the saucy style in which she jerked the page from his finger:\nhe contented himself with going a bit farther back and looking at her\ninstead of the book.  She continued reading, or seeking for something to\nread.  His attention became, by degrees, quite centred in the study of\nher thick silky curls: her face he couldn't see, and she couldn't see\nhim.  And, perhaps, not quite awake to what he did, but attracted like a\nchild to a candle, at last he proceeded from staring to touching; he put\nout his hand and stroked one curl, as gently as if it were a bird.  He\nmight have stuck a knife into her neck, she started round in such a\ntaking.\n\n'\"Get away this moment!  How dare you touch me?  Why are you stopping\nthere?\" she cried, in a tone of disgust.  \"I can't endure you!  I'll go\nupstairs again, if you come near me.\"\n\n'Mr. Hareton recoiled, looking as foolish as he could do: he sat down in\nthe settle very quiet, and she continued turning over her volumes another\nhalf hour; finally, Earnshaw crossed over, and whispered to me.\n\n'\"Will you ask her to read to us, Zillah?  I'm stalled of doing naught;\nand I do like--I could like to hear her!  Dunnot say I wanted it, but ask\nof yourseln.\"\n\n'\"Mr. Hareton wishes you would read to us, ma'am,\" I said, immediately.\n\"He'd take it very kind--he'd be much obliged.\"\n\n'She frowned; and looking up, answered--\n\n'\"Mr. Hareton, and the whole set of you, will be good enough to\nunderstand that I reject any pretence at kindness you have the hypocrisy\nto offer!  I despise you, and will have nothing to say to any of you!\nWhen I would have given my life for one kind word, even to see one of\nyour faces, you all kept off.  But I won't complain to you!  I'm driven\ndown here by the cold; not either to amuse you or enjoy your society.\"\n\n'\"What could I ha' done?\" began Earnshaw.  \"How was I to blame?\"\n\n'\"Oh! you are an exception,\" answered Mrs. Heathcliff.  \"I never missed\nsuch a concern as you.\"\n\n'\"But I offered more than once, and asked,\" he said, kindling up at her\npertness, \"I asked Mr. Heathcliff to let me wake for you--\"\n\n'\"Be silent!  I'll go out of doors, or anywhere, rather than have your\ndisagreeable voice in my ear!\" said my lady.\n\n'Hareton muttered she might go to hell, for him! and unslinging his gun,\nrestrained himself from his Sunday occupations no longer.  He talked now,\nfreely enough; and she presently saw fit to retreat to her solitude: but\nthe frost had set in, and, in spite of her pride, she was forced to\ncondescend to our company, more and more.  However, I took care there\nshould be no further scorning at my good nature: ever since, I've been as\nstiff as herself; and she has no lover or liker among us: and she does\nnot deserve one; for, let them say the least word to her, and she'll curl\nback without respect of any one.  She'll snap at the master himself, and\nas good as dares him to thrash her; and the more hurt she gets, the more\nvenomous she grows.'\n\nAt first, on hearing this account from Zillah, I determined to leave my\nsituation, take a cottage, and get Catherine to come and live with me:\nbut Mr. Heathcliff would as soon permit that as he would set up Hareton\nin an independent house; and I can see no remedy, at present, unless she\ncould marry again; and that scheme it does not come within my province to\narrange.\n\n* * * * *\n\nThus ended Mrs. Dean's story.  Notwithstanding the doctor's prophecy, I\nam rapidly recovering strength; and though it be only the second week in\nJanuary, I propose getting out on horseback in a day or two, and riding\nover to Wuthering Heights, to inform my landlord that I shall spend the\nnext six months in London; and, if he likes, he may look out for another\ntenant to take the place after October.  I would not pass another winter\nhere for much.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXI\n\n\nYesterday was bright, calm, and frosty.  I went to the Heights as I\nproposed: my housekeeper entreated me to bear a little note from her to\nher young lady, and I did not refuse, for the worthy woman was not\nconscious of anything odd in her request.  The front door stood open, but\nthe jealous gate was fastened, as at my last visit; I knocked and invoked\nEarnshaw from among the garden-beds; he unchained it, and I entered.  The\nfellow is as handsome a rustic as need be seen.  I took particular notice\nof him this time; but then he does his best apparently to make the least\nof his advantages.\n\nI asked if Mr. Heathcliff were at home?  He answered, No; but he would be\nin at dinner-time.  It was eleven o'clock, and I announced my intention\nof going in and waiting for him; at which he immediately flung down his\ntools and accompanied me, in the office of watchdog, not as a substitute\nfor the host.\n\nWe entered together; Catherine was there, making herself useful in\npreparing some vegetables for the approaching meal; she looked more\nsulky and less spirited than when I had seen her first. She hardly\nraised her eyes to notice me, and continued her employment with the same\ndisregard to common forms of politeness as before; never returning my\nbow and good-morning by the slightest acknowledgment.\n\n'She does not seem so amiable,' I thought, 'as Mrs. Dean would persuade\nme to believe.  She's a beauty, it is true; but not an angel.'\n\nEarnshaw surlily bid her remove her things to the kitchen.  'Remove them\nyourself,' she said, pushing them from her as soon as she had done; and\nretiring to a stool by the window, where she began to carve figures of\nbirds and beasts out of the turnip-parings in her lap.  I approached her,\npretending to desire a view of the garden; and, as I fancied, adroitly\ndropped Mrs. Dean's note on to her knee, unnoticed by Hareton--but she\nasked aloud, 'What is that?'  And chucked it off.\n\n'A letter from your old acquaintance, the housekeeper at the Grange,' I\nanswered; annoyed at her exposing my kind deed, and fearful lest it\nshould be imagined a missive of my own.  She would gladly have gathered\nit up at this information, but Hareton beat her; he seized and put it in\nhis waistcoat, saying Mr. Heathcliff should look at it first.  Thereat,\nCatherine silently turned her face from us, and, very stealthily, drew\nout her pocket-handkerchief and applied it to her eyes; and her cousin,\nafter struggling awhile to keep down his softer feelings, pulled out the\nletter and flung it on the floor beside her, as ungraciously as he could.\nCatherine caught and perused it eagerly; then she put a few questions to\nme concerning the inmates, rational and irrational, of her former home;\nand gazing towards the hills, murmured in soliloquy:\n\n'I should like to be riding Minny down there!  I should like to be\nclimbing up there!  Oh!  I'm tired--I'm _stalled_, Hareton!'  And she\nleant her pretty head back against the sill, with half a yawn and half a\nsigh, and lapsed into an aspect of abstracted sadness: neither caring nor\nknowing whether we remarked her.\n\n'Mrs. Heathcliff,' I said, after sitting some time mute, 'you are not\naware that I am an acquaintance of yours? so intimate that I think it\nstrange you won't come and speak to me.  My housekeeper never wearies of\ntalking about and praising you; and she'll be greatly disappointed if I\nreturn with no news of or from you, except that you received her letter\nand said nothing!'\n\nShe appeared to wonder at this speech, and asked,--\n\n'Does Ellen like you?'\n\n'Yes, very well,' I replied, hesitatingly.\n\n'You must tell her,' she continued, 'that I would answer her letter, but\nI have no materials for writing: not even a book from which I might tear\na leaf.'\n\n'No books!' I exclaimed.  'How do you contrive to live here without them?\nif I may take the liberty to inquire.  Though provided with a large\nlibrary, I'm frequently very dull at the Grange; take my books away, and\nI should be desperate!'\n\n'I was always reading, when I had them,' said Catherine; 'and Mr.\nHeathcliff never reads; so he took it into his head to destroy my books.\nI have not had a glimpse of one for weeks.  Only once, I searched through\nJoseph's store of theology, to his great irritation; and once, Hareton, I\ncame upon a secret stock in your room--some Latin and Greek, and some\ntales and poetry: all old friends.  I brought the last here--and you\ngathered them, as a magpie gathers silver spoons, for the mere love of\nstealing!  They are of no use to you; or else you concealed them in the\nbad spirit that, as you cannot enjoy them, nobody else shall.  Perhaps\n_your_ envy counselled Mr. Heathcliff to rob me of my treasures?  But\nI've most of them written on my brain and printed in my heart, and you\ncannot deprive me of those!'\n\nEarnshaw blushed crimson when his cousin made this revelation of his\nprivate literary accumulations, and stammered an indignant denial of her\naccusations.\n\n'Mr. Hareton is desirous of increasing his amount of knowledge,' I said,\ncoming to his rescue.  'He is not _envious_, but _emulous_ of your\nattainments.  He'll be a clever scholar in a few years.'\n\n'And he wants me to sink into a dunce, meantime,' answered Catherine.\n'Yes, I hear him trying to spell and read to himself, and pretty blunders\nhe makes!  I wish you would repeat Chevy Chase as you did yesterday: it\nwas extremely funny.  I heard you; and I heard you turning over the\ndictionary to seek out the hard words, and then cursing because you\ncouldn't read their explanations!'\n\nThe young man evidently thought it too bad that he should be laughed at\nfor his ignorance, and then laughed at for trying to remove it.  I had a\nsimilar notion; and, remembering Mrs. Dean's anecdote of his first\nattempt at enlightening the darkness in which he had been reared, I\nobserved,--'But, Mrs. Heathcliff, we have each had a commencement, and\neach stumbled and tottered on the threshold; had our teachers scorned\ninstead of aiding us, we should stumble and totter yet.'\n\n'Oh!' she replied, 'I don't wish to limit his acquirements: still, he has\nno right to appropriate what is mine, and make it ridiculous to me with\nhis vile mistakes and mispronunciations!  Those books, both prose and\nverse, are consecrated to me by other associations; and I hate to have\nthem debased and profaned in his mouth!  Besides, of all, he has selected\nmy favourite pieces that I love the most to repeat, as if out of\ndeliberate malice.'\n\nHareton's chest heaved in silence a minute: he laboured under a severe\nsense of mortification and wrath, which it was no easy task to suppress.\nI rose, and, from a gentlemanly idea of relieving his embarrassment, took\nup my station in the doorway, surveying the external prospect as I stood.\nHe followed my example, and left the room; but presently reappeared,\nbearing half a dozen volumes in his hands, which he threw into\nCatherine's lap, exclaiming,--'Take them!  I never want to hear, or read,\nor think of them again!'\n\n'I won't have them now,' she answered.  'I shall connect them with you,\nand hate them.'\n\nShe opened one that had obviously been often turned over, and read a\nportion in the drawling tone of a beginner; then laughed, and threw it\nfrom her.  'And listen,' she continued, provokingly, commencing a verse\nof an old ballad in the same fashion.\n\nBut his self-love would endure no further torment: I heard, and not\naltogether disapprovingly, a manual check given to her saucy tongue.  The\nlittle wretch had done her utmost to hurt her cousin's sensitive though\nuncultivated feelings, and a physical argument was the only mode he had\nof balancing the account, and repaying its effects on the inflictor.  He\nafterwards gathered the books and hurled them on the fire.  I read in his\ncountenance what anguish it was to offer that sacrifice to spleen.  I\nfancied that as they consumed, he recalled the pleasure they had already\nimparted, and the triumph and ever-increasing pleasure he had anticipated\nfrom them; and I fancied I guessed the incitement to his secret studies\nalso.  He had been content with daily labour and rough animal enjoyments,\ntill Catherine crossed his path.  Shame at her scorn, and hope of her\napproval, were his first prompters to higher pursuits; and instead of\nguarding him from one and winning him to the other, his endeavours to\nraise himself had produced just the contrary result.\n\n'Yes that's all the good that such a brute as you can get from them!'\ncried Catherine, sucking her damaged lip, and watching the conflagration\nwith indignant eyes.\n\n'You'd _better_ hold your tongue, now,' he answered fiercely.\n\nAnd his agitation precluded further speech; he advanced hastily to the\nentrance, where I made way for him to pass.  But ere he had crossed the\ndoor-stones, Mr. Heathcliff, coming up the causeway, encountered him, and\nlaying hold of his shoulder asked,--'What's to do now, my lad?'\n\n'Naught, naught,' he said, and broke away to enjoy his grief and anger in\nsolitude.\n\nHeathcliff gazed after him, and sighed.\n\n'It will be odd if I thwart myself,' he muttered, unconscious that I was\nbehind him.  'But when I look for his father in his face, I find _her_\nevery day more!  How the devil is he so like?  I can hardly bear to see\nhim.'\n\nHe bent his eyes to the ground, and walked moodily in.  There was a\nrestless, anxious expression in his countenance.  I had never remarked\nthere before; and he looked sparer in person.  His daughter-in-law, on\nperceiving him through the window, immediately escaped to the kitchen, so\nthat I remained alone.\n\n'I'm glad to see you out of doors again, Mr. Lockwood,' he said, in reply\nto my greeting; 'from selfish motives partly: I don't think I could\nreadily supply your loss in this desolation.  I've wondered more than\nonce what brought you here.'\n\n'An idle whim, I fear, sir,' was my answer; 'or else an idle whim is\ngoing to spirit me away.  I shall set out for London next week; and I\nmust give you warning that I feel no disposition to retain Thrushcross\nGrange beyond the twelve months I agreed to rent it.  I believe I shall\nnot live there any more.'\n\n'Oh, indeed; you're tired of being banished from the world, are you?' he\nsaid.  'But if you be coming to plead off paying for a place you won't\noccupy, your journey is useless: I never relent in exacting my due from\nany one.'\n\n'I'm coming to plead off nothing about it,' I exclaimed, considerably\nirritated.  'Should you wish it, I'll settle with you now,' and I drew my\nnote-book from my pocket.\n\n'No, no,' he replied, coolly; 'you'll leave sufficient behind to cover\nyour debts, if you fail to return: I'm not in such a hurry.  Sit down and\ntake your dinner with us; a guest that is safe from repeating his visit\ncan generally be made welcome.  Catherine! bring the things in: where are\nyou?'\n\nCatherine reappeared, bearing a tray of knives and forks.\n\n'You may get your dinner with Joseph,' muttered Heathcliff, aside, 'and\nremain in the kitchen till he is gone.'\n\nShe obeyed his directions very punctually: perhaps she had no temptation\nto transgress.  Living among clowns and misanthropists, she probably\ncannot appreciate a better class of people when she meets them.\n\nWith Mr. Heathcliff, grim and saturnine, on the one hand, and Hareton,\nabsolutely dumb, on the other, I made a somewhat cheerless meal, and bade\nadieu early.  I would have departed by the back way, to get a last\nglimpse of Catherine and annoy old Joseph; but Hareton received orders to\nlead up my horse, and my host himself escorted me to the door, so I could\nnot fulfil my wish.\n\n'How dreary life gets over in that house!' I reflected, while riding down\nthe road.  'What a realisation of something more romantic than a fairy\ntale it would have been for Mrs. Linton Heathcliff, had she and I struck\nup an attachment, as her good nurse desired, and migrated together into\nthe stirring atmosphere of the town!'\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXII\n\n\n1802.--This September I was invited to devastate the moors of a friend in\nthe north, and on my journey to his abode, I unexpectedly came within\nfifteen miles of Gimmerton.  The ostler at a roadside public-house was\nholding a pail of water to refresh my horses, when a cart of very green\noats, newly reaped, passed by, and he remarked,--'Yon's frough Gimmerton,\nnah!  They're allas three wick' after other folk wi' ther harvest.'\n\n'Gimmerton?' I repeated--my residence in that locality had already grown\ndim and dreamy.  'Ah!  I know.  How far is it from this?'\n\n'Happen fourteen mile o'er th' hills; and a rough road,' he answered.\n\nA sudden impulse seized me to visit Thrushcross Grange.  It was scarcely\nnoon, and I conceived that I might as well pass the night under my own\nroof as in an inn.  Besides, I could spare a day easily to arrange\nmatters with my landlord, and thus save myself the trouble of invading\nthe neighbourhood again.  Having rested awhile, I directed my servant to\ninquire the way to the village; and, with great fatigue to our beasts, we\nmanaged the distance in some three hours.\n\nI left him there, and proceeded down the valley alone.  The grey church\nlooked greyer, and the lonely churchyard lonelier.  I distinguished a\nmoor-sheep cropping the short turf on the graves.  It was sweet, warm\nweather--too warm for travelling; but the heat did not hinder me from\nenjoying the delightful scenery above and below: had I seen it nearer\nAugust, I'm sure it would have tempted me to waste a month among its\nsolitudes.  In winter nothing more dreary, in summer nothing more divine,\nthan those glens shut in by hills, and those bluff, bold swells of heath.\n\nI reached the Grange before sunset, and knocked for admittance; but the\nfamily had retreated into the back premises, I judged, by one thin, blue\nwreath, curling from the kitchen chimney, and they did not hear.  I rode\ninto the court.  Under the porch, a girl of nine or ten sat knitting, and\nan old woman reclined on the housesteps, smoking a meditative pipe.\n\n'Is Mrs. Dean within?' I demanded of the dame.\n\n'Mistress Dean?  Nay!' she answered, 'she doesn't bide here: shoo's up at\nth' Heights.'\n\n'Are you the housekeeper, then?' I continued.\n\n'Eea, aw keep th' hause,' she replied.\n\n'Well, I'm Mr. Lockwood, the master.  Are there any rooms to lodge me in,\nI wonder?  I wish to stay all night.'\n\n'T' maister!' she cried in astonishment.  'Whet, whoiver knew yah wur\ncoming?  Yah sud ha' send word.  They's nowt norther dry nor mensful\nabaht t' place: nowt there isn't!'\n\nShe threw down her pipe and bustled in, the girl followed, and I entered\ntoo; soon perceiving that her report was true, and, moreover, that I had\nalmost upset her wits by my unwelcome apparition, I bade her be composed.\nI would go out for a walk; and, meantime she must try to prepare a corner\nof a sitting-room for me to sup in, and a bedroom to sleep in.  No\nsweeping and dusting, only good fire and dry sheets were necessary.  She\nseemed willing to do her best; though she thrust the hearth-brush into\nthe grates in mistake for the poker, and malappropriated several other\narticles of her craft: but I retired, confiding in her energy for a\nresting-place against my return.  Wuthering Heights was the goal of my\nproposed excursion.  An afterthought brought me back, when I had quitted\nthe court.\n\n'All well at the Heights?' I inquired of the woman.\n\n'Eea, f'r owt ee knaw!' she answered, skurrying away with a pan of hot\ncinders.\n\nI would have asked why Mrs. Dean had deserted the Grange, but it was\nimpossible to delay her at such a crisis, so I turned away and made my\nexit, rambling leisurely along, with the glow of a sinking sun behind,\nand the mild glory of a rising moon in front--one fading, and the other\nbrightening--as I quitted the park, and climbed the stony by-road\nbranching off to Mr. Heathcliff's dwelling.  Before I arrived in sight of\nit, all that remained of day was a beamless amber light along the west:\nbut I could see every pebble on the path, and every blade of grass, by\nthat splendid moon.  I had neither to climb the gate nor to knock--it\nyielded to my hand.  That is an improvement, I thought.  And I noticed\nanother, by the aid of my nostrils; a fragrance of stocks and wallflowers\nwafted on the air from amongst the homely fruit-trees.\n\nBoth doors and lattices were open; and yet, as is usually the case in a\ncoal-district, a fine red fire illumined the chimney: the comfort which\nthe eye derives from it renders the extra heat endurable.  But the house\nof Wuthering Heights is so large that the inmates have plenty of space\nfor withdrawing out of its influence; and accordingly what inmates there\nwere had stationed themselves not far from one of the windows.  I could\nboth see them and hear them talk before I entered, and looked and\nlistened in consequence; being moved thereto by a mingled sense of\ncuriosity and envy, that grew as I lingered.\n\n'Con-_trary_!' said a voice as sweet as a silver bell.  'That for the\nthird time, you dunce!  I'm not going to tell you again. Recollect, or\nI'll pull your hair!'\n\n'Contrary, then,' answered another, in deep but softened tones. 'And now,\nkiss me, for minding so well.'\n\n'No, read it over first correctly, without a single mistake.'\n\nThe male speaker began to read: he was a young man, respectably dressed\nand seated at a table, having a book before him.  His handsome features\nglowed with pleasure, and his eyes kept impatiently wandering from the\npage to a small white hand over his shoulder, which recalled him by a\nsmart slap on the cheek, whenever its owner detected such signs of\ninattention.  Its owner stood behind; her light, shining ringlets\nblending, at intervals, with his brown looks, as she bent to superintend\nhis studies; and her face--it was lucky he could not see her face, or he\nwould never have been so steady.  I could; and I bit my lip in spite, at\nhaving thrown away the chance I might have had of doing something besides\nstaring at its smiting beauty.\n\nThe task was done, not free from further blunders; but the pupil claimed\na reward, and received at least five kisses; which, however, he\ngenerously returned.  Then they came to the door, and from their\nconversation I judged they were about to issue out and have a walk on the\nmoors.  I supposed I should be condemned in Hareton Earnshaw's heart, if\nnot by his mouth, to the lowest pit in the infernal regions if I showed\nmy unfortunate person in his neighbourhood then; and feeling very mean\nand malignant, I skulked round to seek refuge in the kitchen.  There was\nunobstructed admittance on that side also; and at the door sat my old\nfriend Nelly Dean, sewing and singing a song; which was often interrupted\nfrom within by harsh words of scorn and intolerance, uttered in far from\nmusical accents.\n\n'I'd rayther, by th' haulf, hev' 'em swearing i' my lugs fro'h morn to\nneeght, nor hearken ye hahsiver!' said the tenant of the kitchen, in\nanswer to an unheard speech of Nelly's.  'It's a blazing shame, that I\ncannot oppen t' blessed Book, but yah set up them glories to sattan, and\nall t' flaysome wickednesses that iver were born into th' warld!  Oh!\nye're a raight nowt; and shoo's another; and that poor lad 'll be lost\natween ye.  Poor lad!' he added, with a groan; 'he's witched: I'm sartin\non't.  Oh, Lord, judge 'em, for there's norther law nor justice among wer\nrullers!'\n\n'No! or we should be sitting in flaming fagots, I suppose,' retorted the\nsinger.  'But wisht, old man, and read your Bible like a Christian, and\nnever mind me.  This is \"Fairy Annie's Wedding\"--a bonny tune--it goes to\na dance.'\n\nMrs. Dean was about to recommence, when I advanced; and recognising me\ndirectly, she jumped to her feet, crying--'Why, bless you, Mr. Lockwood!\nHow could you think of returning in this way?  All's shut up at\nThrushcross Grange.  You should have given us notice!'\n\n'I've arranged to be accommodated there, for as long as I shall stay,' I\nanswered.  'I depart again to-morrow.  And how are you transplanted here,\nMrs. Dean? tell me that.'\n\n'Zillah left, and Mr. Heathcliff wished me to come, soon after you went\nto London, and stay till you returned.  But, step in, pray! Have you\nwalked from Gimmerton this evening?'\n\n'From the Grange,' I replied; 'and while they make me lodging room there,\nI want to finish my business with your master; because I don't think of\nhaving another opportunity in a hurry.'\n\n'What business, sir?' said Nelly, conducting me into the house. 'He's\ngone out at present, and won't return soon.'\n\n'About the rent,' I answered.\n\n'Oh! then it is with Mrs. Heathcliff you must settle,' she observed; 'or\nrather with me.  She has not learnt to manage her affairs yet, and I act\nfor her: there's nobody else.'\n\nI looked surprised.\n\n'Ah! you have not heard of Heathcliff's death, I see,' she continued.\n\n'Heathcliff dead!' I exclaimed, astonished.  'How long ago?'\n\n'Three months since: but sit down, and let me take your hat, and I'll\ntell you all about it.  Stop, you have had nothing to eat, have you?'\n\n'I want nothing: I have ordered supper at home.  You sit down too. I\nnever dreamt of his dying!  Let me hear how it came to pass.  You say you\ndon't expect them back for some time--the young people?'\n\n'No--I have to scold them every evening for their late rambles: but they\ndon't care for me.  At least, have a drink of our old ale; it will do you\ngood: you seem weary.'\n\nShe hastened to fetch it before I could refuse, and I heard Joseph asking\nwhether 'it warn't a crying scandal that she should have followers at her\ntime of life?  And then, to get them jocks out o' t' maister's cellar!  He\nfair shaamed to 'bide still and see it.'\n\nShe did not stay to retaliate, but re-entered in a minute, bearing a\nreaming silver pint, whose contents I lauded with becoming earnestness.\nAnd afterwards she furnished me with the sequel of Heathcliff's history.\nHe had a 'queer' end, as she expressed it.\n\nI was summoned to Wuthering Heights, within a fortnight of your leaving\nus, she said; and I obeyed joyfully, for Catherine's sake. My first\ninterview with her grieved and shocked me: she had altered so much since\nour separation.  Mr. Heathcliff did not explain his reasons for taking a\nnew mind about my coming here; he only told me he wanted me, and he was\ntired of seeing Catherine: I must make the little parlour my\nsitting-room, and keep her with me. It was enough if he were obliged to\nsee her once or twice a day. She seemed pleased at this arrangement; and,\nby degrees, I smuggled over a great number of books, and other articles,\nthat had formed her amusement at the Grange; and flattered myself we\nshould get on in tolerable comfort.  The delusion did not last long.\nCatherine, contented at first, in a brief space grew irritable and\nrestless. For one thing, she was forbidden to move out of the garden, and\nit fretted her sadly to be confined to its narrow bounds as spring drew\non; for another, in following the house, I was forced to quit her\nfrequently, and she complained of loneliness: she preferred quarrelling\nwith Joseph in the kitchen to sitting at peace in her solitude.  I did\nnot mind their skirmishes: but Hareton was often obliged to seek the\nkitchen also, when the master wanted to have the house to himself! and\nthough in the beginning she either left it at his approach, or quietly\njoined in my occupations, and shunned remarking or addressing him--and\nthough he was always as sullen and silent as possible--after a while, she\nchanged her behaviour, and became incapable of letting him alone: talking\nat him; commenting on his stupidity and idleness; expressing her wonder\nhow he could endure the life he lived--how he could sit a whole evening\nstaring into the fire, and dozing.\n\n'He's just like a dog, is he not, Ellen?' she once observed, 'or a\ncart-horse? He does his work, eats his food, and sleeps eternally! What\na blank, dreary mind he must have! Do you ever dream, Hareton? And, if\nyou do, what is it about? But you can't speak to me!'\n\nThen she looked at him; but he would neither open his mouth nor look\nagain.\n\n'He's, perhaps, dreaming now,' she continued.  'He twitched his shoulder\nas Juno twitches hers.  Ask him, Ellen.'\n\n'Mr. Hareton will ask the master to send you up-stairs, if you don't\nbehave!' I said.  He had not only twitched his shoulder but clenched his\nfist, as if tempted to use it.\n\n'I know why Hareton never speaks, when I am in the kitchen,' she\nexclaimed, on another occasion.  'He is afraid I shall laugh at him.\nEllen, what do you think?  He began to teach himself to read once; and,\nbecause I laughed, he burned his books, and dropped it: was he not a\nfool?'\n\n'Were not you naughty?' I said; 'answer me that.'\n\n'Perhaps I was,' she went on; 'but I did not expect him to be so silly.\nHareton, if I gave you a book, would you take it now?  I'll try!'\n\nShe placed one she had been perusing on his hand; he flung it off, and\nmuttered, if she did not give over, he would break her neck.\n\n'Well, I shall put it here,' she said, 'in the table-drawer; and I'm\ngoing to bed.'\n\nThen she whispered me to watch whether he touched it, and departed.  But\nhe would not come near it; and so I informed her in the morning, to her\ngreat disappointment.  I saw she was sorry for his persevering sulkiness\nand indolence: her conscience reproved her for frightening him off\nimproving himself: she had done it effectually.  But her ingenuity was at\nwork to remedy the injury: while I ironed, or pursued other such\nstationary employments as I could not well do in the parlour, she would\nbring some pleasant volume and read it aloud to me.  When Hareton was\nthere, she generally paused in an interesting part, and left the book\nlying about: that she did repeatedly; but he was as obstinate as a mule,\nand, instead of snatching at her bait, in wet weather he took to smoking\nwith Joseph; and they sat like automatons, one on each side of the fire,\nthe elder happily too deaf to understand her wicked nonsense, as he would\nhave called it, the younger doing his best to seem to disregard it.  On\nfine evenings the latter followed his shooting expeditions, and Catherine\nyawned and sighed, and teased me to talk to her, and ran off into the\ncourt or garden the moment I began; and, as a last resource, cried, and\nsaid she was tired of living: her life was useless.\n\nMr. Heathcliff, who grew more and more disinclined to society, had almost\nbanished Earnshaw from his apartment.  Owing to an accident at the\ncommencement of March, he became for some days a fixture in the kitchen.\nHis gun burst while out on the hills by himself; a splinter cut his arm,\nand he lost a good deal of blood before he could reach home.  The\nconsequence was that, perforce, he was condemned to the fireside and\ntranquillity, till he made it up again.  It suited Catherine to have him\nthere: at any rate, it made her hate her room up-stairs more than ever:\nand she would compel me to find out business below, that she might\naccompany me.\n\nOn Easter Monday, Joseph went to Gimmerton fair with some cattle; and, in\nthe afternoon, I was busy getting up linen in the kitchen.  Earnshaw sat,\nmorose as usual, at the chimney corner, and my little mistress was\nbeguiling an idle hour with drawing pictures on the window-panes, varying\nher amusement by smothered bursts of songs, and whispered ejaculations,\nand quick glances of annoyance and impatience in the direction of her\ncousin, who steadfastly smoked, and looked into the grate.  At a notice\nthat I could do with her no longer intercepting my light, she removed to\nthe hearthstone.  I bestowed little attention on her proceedings, but,\npresently, I heard her begin--'I've found out, Hareton, that I want--that\nI'm glad--that I should like you to be my cousin now, if you had not\ngrown so cross to me, and so rough.'\n\nHareton returned no answer.\n\n'Hareton, Hareton, Hareton! do you hear?' she continued.\n\n'Get off wi' ye!' he growled, with uncompromising gruffness.\n\n'Let me take that pipe,' she said, cautiously advancing her hand and\nabstracting it from his mouth.\n\nBefore he could attempt to recover it, it was broken, and behind the\nfire.  He swore at her and seized another.\n\n'Stop,' she cried, 'you must listen to me first; and I can't speak while\nthose clouds are floating in my face.'\n\n'Will you go to the devil!' he exclaimed, ferociously, 'and let me be!'\n\n'No,' she persisted, 'I won't: I can't tell what to do to make you talk\nto me; and you are determined not to understand.  When I call you stupid,\nI don't mean anything: I don't mean that I despise you.  Come, you shall\ntake notice of me, Hareton: you are my cousin, and you shall own me.'\n\n'I shall have naught to do wi' you and your mucky pride, and your damned\nmocking tricks!' he answered.  'I'll go to hell, body and soul, before I\nlook sideways after you again.  Side out o' t' gate, now, this minute!'\n\nCatherine frowned, and retreated to the window-seat chewing her lip, and\nendeavouring, by humming an eccentric tune, to conceal a growing tendency\nto sob.\n\n'You should be friends with your cousin, Mr. Hareton,' I interrupted,\n'since she repents of her sauciness.  It would do you a great deal of\ngood: it would make you another man to have her for a companion.'\n\n'A companion!' he cried; 'when she hates me, and does not think me fit to\nwipe her shoon!  Nay, if it made me a king, I'd not be scorned for\nseeking her good-will any more.'\n\n'It is not I who hate you, it is you who hate me!' wept Cathy, no longer\ndisguising her trouble.  'You hate me as much as Mr. Heathcliff does, and\nmore.'\n\n'You're a damned liar,' began Earnshaw: 'why have I made him angry, by\ntaking your part, then, a hundred times? and that when you sneered at and\ndespised me, and--Go on plaguing me, and I'll step in yonder, and say you\nworried me out of the kitchen!'\n\n'I didn't know you took my part,' she answered, drying her eyes; 'and I\nwas miserable and bitter at everybody; but now I thank you, and beg you\nto forgive me: what can I do besides?'\n\nShe returned to the hearth, and frankly extended her hand.  He blackened\nand scowled like a thunder-cloud, and kept his fists resolutely clenched,\nand his gaze fixed on the ground.  Catherine, by instinct, must have\ndivined it was obdurate perversity, and not dislike, that prompted this\ndogged conduct; for, after remaining an instant undecided, she stooped\nand impressed on his cheek a gentle kiss.  The little rogue thought I had\nnot seen her, and, drawing back, she took her former station by the\nwindow, quite demurely.  I shook my head reprovingly, and then she\nblushed and whispered--'Well! what should I have done, Ellen?  He\nwouldn't shake hands, and he wouldn't look: I must show him some way that\nI like him--that I want to be friends.'\n\nWhether the kiss convinced Hareton, I cannot tell: he was very careful,\nfor some minutes, that his face should not be seen, and when he did raise\nit, he was sadly puzzled where to turn his eyes.\n\nCatherine employed herself in wrapping a handsome book neatly in white\npaper, and having tied it with a bit of ribbon, and addressed it to 'Mr.\nHareton Earnshaw,' she desired me to be her ambassadress, and convey the\npresent to its destined recipient.\n\n'And tell him, if he'll take it, I'll come and teach him to read it\nright,' she said; 'and, if he refuse it, I'll go upstairs, and never\ntease him again.'\n\nI carried it, and repeated the message; anxiously watched by my employer.\nHareton would not open his fingers, so I laid it on his knee.  He did not\nstrike it off, either.  I returned to my work.  Catherine leaned her head\nand arms on the table, till she heard the slight rustle of the covering\nbeing removed; then she stole away, and quietly seated herself beside her\ncousin.  He trembled, and his face glowed: all his rudeness and all his\nsurly harshness had deserted him: he could not summon courage, at first,\nto utter a syllable in reply to her questioning look, and her murmured\npetition.\n\n'Say you forgive me, Hareton, do.  You can make me so happy by speaking\nthat little word.'\n\nHe muttered something inaudible.\n\n'And you'll be my friend?' added Catherine, interrogatively.\n\n'Nay, you'll be ashamed of me every day of your life,' he answered; 'and\nthe more ashamed, the more you know me; and I cannot bide it.'\n\n'So you won't be my friend?' she said, smiling as sweet as honey, and\ncreeping close up.\n\nI overheard no further distinguishable talk, but, on looking round again,\nI perceived two such radiant countenances bent over the page of the\naccepted book, that I did not doubt the treaty had been ratified on both\nsides; and the enemies were, thenceforth, sworn allies.\n\nThe work they studied was full of costly pictures; and those and their\nposition had charm enough to keep them unmoved till Joseph came home.  He,\npoor man, was perfectly aghast at the spectacle of Catherine seated on\nthe same bench with Hareton Earnshaw, leaning her hand on his shoulder;\nand confounded at his favourite's endurance of her proximity: it affected\nhim too deeply to allow an observation on the subject that night.  His\nemotion was only revealed by the immense sighs he drew, as he solemnly\nspread his large Bible on the table, and overlaid it with dirty\nbank-notes from his pocket-book, the produce of the day's transactions.\nAt length he summoned Hareton from his seat.\n\n'Tak' these in to t' maister, lad,' he said, 'and bide there.  I's gang\nup to my own rahm.  This hoile's neither mensful nor seemly for us: we\nmun side out and seearch another.'\n\n'Come, Catherine,' I said, 'we must \"side out\" too: I've done my ironing.\nAre you ready to go?'\n\n'It is not eight o'clock!' she answered, rising unwillingly.\n\n'Hareton, I'll leave this book upon the chimney-piece, and I'll bring\nsome more to-morrow.'\n\n'Ony books that yah leave, I shall tak' into th' hahse,' said Joseph,\n'and it'll be mitch if yah find 'em agean; soa, yah may plase yerseln!'\n\nCathy threatened that his library should pay for hers; and, smiling as\nshe passed Hareton, went singing up-stairs: lighter of heart, I venture\nto say, than ever she had been under that roof before; except, perhaps,\nduring her earliest visits to Linton.\n\nThe intimacy thus commenced grew rapidly; though it encountered temporary\ninterruptions.  Earnshaw was not to be civilized with a wish, and my\nyoung lady was no philosopher, and no paragon of patience; but both their\nminds tending to the same point--one loving and desiring to esteem, and\nthe other loving and desiring to be esteemed--they contrived in the end\nto reach it.\n\nYou see, Mr. Lockwood, it was easy enough to win Mrs. Heathcliff's heart.\nBut now, I'm glad you did not try.  The crown of all my wishes will be\nthe union of those two.  I shall envy no one on their wedding day: there\nwon't be a happier woman than myself in England!\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXIII\n\n\nOn the morrow of that Monday, Earnshaw being still unable to follow his\nordinary employments, and therefore remaining about the house, I speedily\nfound it would be impracticable to retain my charge beside me, as\nheretofore.  She got downstairs before me, and out into the garden, where\nshe had seen her cousin performing some easy work; and when I went to bid\nthem come to breakfast, I saw she had persuaded him to clear a large\nspace of ground from currant and gooseberry bushes, and they were busy\nplanning together an importation of plants from the Grange.\n\nI was terrified at the devastation which had been accomplished in a brief\nhalf-hour; the black-currant trees were the apple of Joseph's eye, and\nshe had just fixed her choice of a flower-bed in the midst of them.\n\n'There!  That will be all shown to the master,' I exclaimed, 'the minute\nit is discovered.  And what excuse have you to offer for taking such\nliberties with the garden?  We shall have a fine explosion on the head of\nit: see if we don't!  Mr. Hareton, I wonder you should have no more wit\nthan to go and make that mess at her bidding!'\n\n'I'd forgotten they were Joseph's,' answered Earnshaw, rather puzzled;\n'but I'll tell him I did it.'\n\nWe always ate our meals with Mr. Heathcliff.  I held the mistress's post\nin making tea and carving; so I was indispensable at table.  Catherine\nusually sat by me, but to-day she stole nearer to Hareton; and I\npresently saw she would have no more discretion in her friendship than\nshe had in her hostility.\n\n'Now, mind you don't talk with and notice your cousin too much,' were my\nwhispered instructions as we entered the room.  'It will certainly annoy\nMr. Heathcliff, and he'll be mad at you both.'\n\n'I'm not going to,' she answered.\n\nThe minute after, she had sidled to him, and was sticking primroses in\nhis plate of porridge.\n\nHe dared not speak to her there: he dared hardly look; and yet she went\non teasing, till he was twice on the point of being provoked to laugh.  I\nfrowned, and then she glanced towards the master: whose mind was occupied\non other subjects than his company, as his countenance evinced; and she\ngrew serious for an instant, scrutinizing him with deep gravity.\nAfterwards she turned, and recommenced her nonsense; at last, Hareton\nuttered a smothered laugh.  Mr. Heathcliff started; his eye rapidly\nsurveyed our faces, Catherine met it with her accustomed look of\nnervousness and yet defiance, which he abhorred.\n\n'It is well you are out of my reach,' he exclaimed.  'What fiend\npossesses you to stare back at me, continually, with those infernal eyes?\nDown with them! and don't remind me of your existence again.  I thought I\nhad cured you of laughing.'\n\n'It was me,' muttered Hareton.\n\n'What do you say?' demanded the master.\n\nHareton looked at his plate, and did not repeat the confession.  Mr.\nHeathcliff looked at him a bit, and then silently resumed his breakfast\nand his interrupted musing.  We had nearly finished, and the two young\npeople prudently shifted wider asunder, so I anticipated no further\ndisturbance during that sitting: when Joseph appeared at the door,\nrevealing by his quivering lip and furious eyes that the outrage\ncommitted on his precious shrubs was detected.  He must have seen Cathy\nand her cousin about the spot before he examined it, for while his jaws\nworked like those of a cow chewing its cud, and rendered his speech\ndifficult to understand, he began:--\n\n'I mun hev' my wage, and I mun goa!  I _hed_ aimed to dee wheare I'd\nsarved fur sixty year; and I thowt I'd lug my books up into t' garret,\nand all my bits o' stuff, and they sud hev' t' kitchen to theirseln; for\nt' sake o' quietness.  It wur hard to gie up my awn hearthstun, but I\nthowt I _could_ do that!  But nah, shoo's taan my garden fro' me, and by\nth' heart, maister, I cannot stand it!  Yah may bend to th' yoak an ye\nwill--I noan used to 't, and an old man doesn't sooin get used to new\nbarthens.  I'd rayther arn my bite an' my sup wi' a hammer in th' road!'\n\n'Now, now, idiot!' interrupted Heathcliff, 'cut it short!  What's your\ngrievance?  I'll interfere in no quarrels between you and Nelly.  She may\nthrust you into the coal-hole for anything I care.'\n\n'It's noan Nelly!' answered Joseph.  'I sudn't shift for Nelly--nasty ill\nnowt as shoo is.  Thank God! _shoo_ cannot stale t' sowl o' nob'dy!  Shoo\nwer niver soa handsome, but what a body mud look at her 'bout winking.\nIt's yon flaysome, graceless quean, that's witched our lad, wi' her bold\neen and her forrard ways--till--Nay! it fair brusts my heart!  He's\nforgotten all I've done for him, and made on him, and goan and riven up a\nwhole row o' t' grandest currant-trees i' t' garden!' and here he\nlamented outright; unmanned by a sense of his bitter injuries, and\nEarnshaw's ingratitude and dangerous condition.\n\n'Is the fool drunk?' asked Mr. Heathcliff.  'Hareton, is it you he's\nfinding fault with?'\n\n'I've pulled up two or three bushes,' replied the young man; 'but I'm\ngoing to set 'em again.'\n\n'And why have you pulled them up?' said the master.\n\nCatherine wisely put in her tongue.\n\n'We wanted to plant some flowers there,' she cried.  'I'm the only person\nto blame, for I wished him to do it.'\n\n'And who the devil gave _you_ leave to touch a stick about the place?'\ndemanded her father-in-law, much surprised.  'And who ordered _you_ to\nobey her?' he added, turning to Hareton.\n\nThe latter was speechless; his cousin replied--'You shouldn't grudge a\nfew yards of earth for me to ornament, when you have taken all my land!'\n\n'Your land, insolent slut!  You never had any,' said Heathcliff.\n\n'And my money,' she continued; returning his angry glare, and meantime\nbiting a piece of crust, the remnant of her breakfast.\n\n'Silence!' he exclaimed.  'Get done, and begone!'\n\n'And Hareton's land, and his money,' pursued the reckless thing.  'Hareton\nand I are friends now; and I shall tell him all about you!'\n\nThe master seemed confounded a moment: he grew pale, and rose up, eyeing\nher all the while, with an expression of mortal hate.\n\n'If you strike me, Hareton will strike you,' she said; 'so you may as\nwell sit down.'\n\n'If Hareton does not turn you out of the room, I'll strike him to hell,'\nthundered Heathcliff.  'Damnable witch! dare you pretend to rouse him\nagainst me?  Off with her!  Do you hear?  Fling her into the kitchen!\nI'll kill her, Ellen Dean, if you let her come into my sight again!'\n\nHareton tried, under his breath, to persuade her to go.\n\n'Drag her away!' he cried, savagely.  'Are you staying to talk?'  And he\napproached to execute his own command.\n\n'He'll not obey you, wicked man, any more,' said Catherine; 'and he'll\nsoon detest you as much as I do.'\n\n'Wisht! wisht!' muttered the young man, reproachfully; 'I will not hear\nyou speak so to him.  Have done.'\n\n'But you won't let him strike me?' she cried.\n\n'Come, then,' he whispered earnestly.\n\nIt was too late: Heathcliff had caught hold of her.\n\n'Now, _you_ go!' he said to Earnshaw.  'Accursed witch! this time she has\nprovoked me when I could not bear it; and I'll make her repent it for\never!'\n\nHe had his hand in her hair; Hareton attempted to release her locks,\nentreating him not to hurt her that once.  Heathcliff's black eyes\nflashed; he seemed ready to tear Catherine in pieces, and I was just\nworked up to risk coming to the rescue, when of a sudden his fingers\nrelaxed; he shifted his grasp from her head to her arm, and gazed\nintently in her face.  Then he drew his hand over his eyes, stood a\nmoment to collect himself apparently, and turning anew to Catherine,\nsaid, with assumed calmness--'You must learn to avoid putting me in a\npassion, or I shall really murder you some time!  Go with Mrs. Dean, and\nkeep with her; and confine your insolence to her ears.  As to Hareton\nEarnshaw, if I see him listen to you, I'll send him seeking his bread\nwhere he can get it!  Your love will make him an outcast and a beggar.\nNelly, take her; and leave me, all of you!  Leave me!'\n\nI led my young lady out: she was too glad of her escape to resist; the\nother followed, and Mr. Heathcliff had the room to himself till dinner.  I\nhad counselled Catherine to dine up-stairs; but, as soon as he perceived\nher vacant seat, he sent me to call her.  He spoke to none of us, ate\nvery little, and went out directly afterwards, intimating that he should\nnot return before evening.\n\nThe two new friends established themselves in the house during his\nabsence; where I heard Hareton sternly check his cousin, on her offering\na revelation of her father-in-law's conduct to his father.  He said he\nwouldn't suffer a word to be uttered in his disparagement: if he were the\ndevil, it didn't signify; he would stand by him; and he'd rather she\nwould abuse himself, as she used to, than begin on Mr. Heathcliff.\nCatherine was waxing cross at this; but he found means to make her hold\nher tongue, by asking how she would like _him_ to speak ill of her\nfather?  Then she comprehended that Earnshaw took the master's reputation\nhome to himself; and was attached by ties stronger than reason could\nbreak--chains, forged by habit, which it would be cruel to attempt to\nloosen.  She showed a good heart, thenceforth, in avoiding both\ncomplaints and expressions of antipathy concerning Heathcliff; and\nconfessed to me her sorrow that she had endeavoured to raise a bad spirit\nbetween him and Hareton: indeed, I don't believe she has ever breathed a\nsyllable, in the latter's hearing, against her oppressor since.\n\nWhen this slight disagreement was over, they were friends again, and as\nbusy as possible in their several occupations of pupil and teacher.  I\ncame in to sit with them, after I had done my work; and I felt so soothed\nand comforted to watch them, that I did not notice how time got on.  You\nknow, they both appeared in a measure my children: I had long been proud\nof one; and now, I was sure, the other would be a source of equal\nsatisfaction.  His honest, warm, and intelligent nature shook off rapidly\nthe clouds of ignorance and degradation in which it had been bred; and\nCatherine's sincere commendations acted as a spur to his industry.  His\nbrightening mind brightened his features, and added spirit and nobility\nto their aspect: I could hardly fancy it the same individual I had beheld\non the day I discovered my little lady at Wuthering Heights, after her\nexpedition to the Crags.  While I admired and they laboured, dusk drew\non, and with it returned the master.  He came upon us quite unexpectedly,\nentering by the front way, and had a full view of the whole three, ere we\ncould raise our heads to glance at him.  Well, I reflected, there was\nnever a pleasanter, or more harmless sight; and it will be a burning\nshame to scold them.  The red fire-light glowed on their two bonny heads,\nand revealed their faces animated with the eager interest of children;\nfor, though he was twenty-three and she eighteen, each had so much of\nnovelty to feel and learn, that neither experienced nor evinced the\nsentiments of sober disenchanted maturity.\n\nThey lifted their eyes together, to encounter Mr. Heathcliff: perhaps you\nhave never remarked that their eyes are precisely similar, and they are\nthose of Catherine Earnshaw.  The present Catherine has no other likeness\nto her, except a breadth of forehead, and a certain arch of the nostril\nthat makes her appear rather haughty, whether she will or not.  With\nHareton the resemblance is carried farther: it is singular at all times,\n_then_ it was particularly striking; because his senses were alert, and\nhis mental faculties wakened to unwonted activity.  I suppose this\nresemblance disarmed Mr. Heathcliff: he walked to the hearth in evident\nagitation; but it quickly subsided as he looked at the young man: or, I\nshould say, altered its character; for it was there yet.  He took the\nbook from his hand, and glanced at the open page, then returned it\nwithout any observation; merely signing Catherine away: her companion\nlingered very little behind her, and I was about to depart also, but he\nbid me sit still.\n\n'It is a poor conclusion, is it not?' he observed, having brooded awhile\non the scene he had just witnessed: 'an absurd termination to my violent\nexertions?  I get levers and mattocks to demolish the two houses, and\ntrain myself to be capable of working like Hercules, and when everything\nis ready and in my power, I find the will to lift a slate off either roof\nhas vanished!  My old enemies have not beaten me; now would be the\nprecise time to revenge myself on their representatives: I could do it;\nand none could hinder me.  But where is the use?  I don't care for\nstriking: I can't take the trouble to raise my hand!  That sounds as if I\nhad been labouring the whole time only to exhibit a fine trait of\nmagnanimity.  It is far from being the case: I have lost the faculty of\nenjoying their destruction, and I am too idle to destroy for nothing.\n\n'Nelly, there is a strange change approaching; I'm in its shadow at\npresent.  I take so little interest in my daily life that I hardly\nremember to eat and drink.  Those two who have left the room are the only\nobjects which retain a distinct material appearance to me; and that\nappearance causes me pain, amounting to agony.  About _her_ I won't\nspeak; and I don't desire to think; but I earnestly wish she were\ninvisible: her presence invokes only maddening sensations.  _He_ moves me\ndifferently: and yet if I could do it without seeming insane, I'd never\nsee him again!  You'll perhaps think me rather inclined to become so,' he\nadded, making an effort to smile, 'if I try to describe the thousand\nforms of past associations and ideas he awakens or embodies.  But you'll\nnot talk of what I tell you; and my mind is so eternally secluded in\nitself, it is tempting at last to turn it out to another.\n\n'Five minutes ago Hareton seemed a personification of my youth, not a\nhuman being; I felt to him in such a variety of ways, that it would have\nbeen impossible to have accosted him rationally.  In the first place, his\nstartling likeness to Catherine connected him fearfully with her.  That,\nhowever, which you may suppose the most potent to arrest my imagination,\nis actually the least: for what is not connected with her to me? and what\ndoes not recall her?  I cannot look down to this floor, but her features\nare shaped in the flags!  In every cloud, in every tree--filling the air\nat night, and caught by glimpses in every object by day--I am surrounded\nwith her image!  The most ordinary faces of men and women--my own\nfeatures--mock me with a resemblance.  The entire world is a dreadful\ncollection of memoranda that she did exist, and that I have lost her!\nWell, Hareton's aspect was the ghost of my immortal love; of my wild\nendeavours to hold my right; my degradation, my pride, my happiness, and\nmy anguish--\n\n'But it is frenzy to repeat these thoughts to you: only it will let you\nknow why, with a reluctance to be always alone, his society is no\nbenefit; rather an aggravation of the constant torment I suffer: and it\npartly contributes to render me regardless how he and his cousin go on\ntogether.  I can give them no attention any more.'\n\n'But what do you mean by a _change_, Mr. Heathcliff?' I said, alarmed at\nhis manner: though he was neither in danger of losing his senses, nor\ndying, according to my judgment: he was quite strong and healthy; and, as\nto his reason, from childhood he had a delight in dwelling on dark\nthings, and entertaining odd fancies.  He might have had a monomania on\nthe subject of his departed idol; but on every other point his wits were\nas sound as mine.\n\n'I shall not know that till it comes,' he said; 'I'm only half conscious\nof it now.'\n\n'You have no feeling of illness, have you?' I asked.\n\n'No, Nelly, I have not,' he answered.\n\n'Then you are not afraid of death?' I pursued.\n\n'Afraid?  No!' he replied.  'I have neither a fear, nor a presentiment,\nnor a hope of death.  Why should I?  With my hard constitution and\ntemperate mode of living, and unperilous occupations, I ought to, and\nprobably _shall_, remain above ground till there is scarcely a black hair\non my head.  And yet I cannot continue in this condition!  I have to\nremind myself to breathe--almost to remind my heart to beat!  And it is\nlike bending back a stiff spring: it is by compulsion that I do the\nslightest act not prompted by one thought; and by compulsion that I\nnotice anything alive or dead, which is not associated with one universal\nidea.  I have a single wish, and my whole being and faculties are\nyearning to attain it.  They have yearned towards it so long, and so\nunwaveringly, that I'm convinced it will be reached--and soon--because it\nhas devoured my existence: I am swallowed up in the anticipation of its\nfulfilment.  My confessions have not relieved me; but they may account\nfor some otherwise unaccountable phases of humour which I show.  O God!\nIt is a long fight; I wish it were over!'\n\nHe began to pace the room, muttering terrible things to himself, till I\nwas inclined to believe, as he said Joseph did, that conscience had\nturned his heart to an earthly hell.  I wondered greatly how it would\nend.  Though he seldom before had revealed this state of mind, even by\nlooks, it was his habitual mood, I had no doubt: he asserted it himself;\nbut not a soul, from his general bearing, would have conjectured the\nfact.  You did not when you saw him, Mr. Lockwood: and at the period of\nwhich I speak, he was just the same as then; only fonder of continued\nsolitude, and perhaps still more laconic in company.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXIV\n\n\nFor some days after that evening Mr. Heathcliff shunned meeting us at\nmeals; yet he would not consent formally to exclude Hareton and Cathy.  He\nhad an aversion to yielding so completely to his feelings, choosing\nrather to absent himself; and eating once in twenty-four hours seemed\nsufficient sustenance for him.\n\nOne night, after the family were in bed, I heard him go downstairs, and\nout at the front door.  I did not hear him re-enter, and in the morning I\nfound he was still away.  We were in April then: the weather was sweet\nand warm, the grass as green as showers and sun could make it, and the\ntwo dwarf apple-trees near the southern wall in full bloom.  After\nbreakfast, Catherine insisted on my bringing a chair and sitting with my\nwork under the fir-trees at the end of the house; and she beguiled\nHareton, who had perfectly recovered from his accident, to dig and\narrange her little garden, which was shifted to that corner by the\ninfluence of Joseph's complaints.  I was comfortably revelling in the\nspring fragrance around, and the beautiful soft blue overhead, when my\nyoung lady, who had run down near the gate to procure some primrose roots\nfor a border, returned only half laden, and informed us that Mr.\nHeathcliff was coming in.  'And he spoke to me,' she added, with a\nperplexed countenance.\n\n'What did he say?' asked Hareton.\n\n'He told me to begone as fast as I could,' she answered.  'But he looked\nso different from his usual look that I stopped a moment to stare at\nhim.'\n\n'How?' he inquired.\n\n'Why, almost bright and cheerful.  No, _almost_ nothing--_very much_\nexcited, and wild, and glad!' she replied.\n\n'Night-walking amuses him, then,' I remarked, affecting a careless\nmanner: in reality as surprised as she was, and anxious to ascertain the\ntruth of her statement; for to see the master looking glad would not be\nan every-day spectacle.  I framed an excuse to go in.  Heathcliff stood\nat the open door; he was pale, and he trembled: yet, certainly, he had a\nstrange joyful glitter in his eyes, that altered the aspect of his whole\nface.\n\n'Will you have some breakfast?' I said.  'You must be hungry, rambling\nabout all night!'  I wanted to discover where he had been, but I did not\nlike to ask directly.\n\n'No, I'm not hungry,' he answered, averting his head, and speaking rather\ncontemptuously, as if he guessed I was trying to divine the occasion of\nhis good humour.\n\nI felt perplexed: I didn't know whether it were not a proper opportunity\nto offer a bit of admonition.\n\n'I don't think it right to wander out of doors,' I observed, 'instead of\nbeing in bed: it is not wise, at any rate this moist season.  I daresay\nyou'll catch a bad cold or a fever: you have something the matter with\nyou now!'\n\n'Nothing but what I can bear,' he replied; 'and with the greatest\npleasure, provided you'll leave me alone: get in, and don't annoy me.'\n\nI obeyed: and, in passing, I noticed he breathed as fast as a cat.\n\n'Yes!' I reflected to myself, 'we shall have a fit of illness.  I cannot\nconceive what he has been doing.'\n\nThat noon he sat down to dinner with us, and received a heaped-up plate\nfrom my hands, as if he intended to make amends for previous fasting.\n\n'I've neither cold nor fever, Nelly,' he remarked, in allusion to my\nmorning's speech; 'and I'm ready to do justice to the food you give me.'\n\nHe took his knife and fork, and was going to commence eating, when the\ninclination appeared to become suddenly extinct.  He laid them on the\ntable, looked eagerly towards the window, then rose and went out.  We saw\nhim walking to and fro in the garden while we concluded our meal, and\nEarnshaw said he'd go and ask why he would not dine: he thought we had\ngrieved him some way.\n\n'Well, is he coming?' cried Catherine, when her cousin returned.\n\n'Nay,' he answered; 'but he's not angry: he seemed rarely pleased indeed;\nonly I made him impatient by speaking to him twice; and then he bid me be\noff to you: he wondered how I could want the company of anybody else.'\n\nI set his plate to keep warm on the fender; and after an hour or two he\nre-entered, when the room was clear, in no degree calmer: the same\nunnatural--it was unnatural--appearance of joy under his black brows; the\nsame bloodless hue, and his teeth visible, now and then, in a kind of\nsmile; his frame shivering, not as one shivers with chill or weakness,\nbut as a tight-stretched cord vibrates--a strong thrilling, rather than\ntrembling.\n\nI will ask what is the matter, I thought; or who should?  And I\nexclaimed--'Have you heard any good news, Mr. Heathcliff?  You look\nuncommonly animated.'\n\n'Where should good news come from to me?' he said.  'I'm animated with\nhunger; and, seemingly, I must not eat.'\n\n'Your dinner is here,' I returned; 'why won't you get it?'\n\n'I don't want it now,' he muttered, hastily: 'I'll wait till supper.  And,\nNelly, once for all, let me beg you to warn Hareton and the other away\nfrom me.  I wish to be troubled by nobody: I wish to have this place to\nmyself.'\n\n'Is there some new reason for this banishment?' I inquired.  'Tell me why\nyou are so queer, Mr. Heathcliff?  Where were you last night?  I'm not\nputting the question through idle curiosity, but--'\n\n'You are putting the question through very idle curiosity,' he\ninterrupted, with a laugh.  'Yet I'll answer it.  Last night I was on the\nthreshold of hell.  To-day, I am within sight of my heaven.  I have my\neyes on it: hardly three feet to sever me!  And now you'd better go!\nYou'll neither see nor hear anything to frighten you, if you refrain from\nprying.'\n\nHaving swept the hearth and wiped the table, I departed; more perplexed\nthan ever.\n\nHe did not quit the house again that afternoon, and no one intruded on\nhis solitude; till, at eight o'clock, I deemed it proper, though\nunsummoned, to carry a candle and his supper to him.  He was leaning\nagainst the ledge of an open lattice, but not looking out: his face was\nturned to the interior gloom.  The fire had smouldered to ashes; the room\nwas filled with the damp, mild air of the cloudy evening; and so still,\nthat not only the murmur of the beck down Gimmerton was distinguishable,\nbut its ripples and its gurgling over the pebbles, or through the large\nstones which it could not cover.  I uttered an ejaculation of discontent\nat seeing the dismal grate, and commenced shutting the casements, one\nafter another, till I came to his.\n\n'Must I close this?' I asked, in order to rouse him; for he would not\nstir.\n\nThe light flashed on his features as I spoke.  Oh, Mr. Lockwood, I cannot\nexpress what a terrible start I got by the momentary view!  Those deep\nblack eyes!  That smile, and ghastly paleness!  It appeared to me, not\nMr. Heathcliff, but a goblin; and, in my terror, I let the candle bend\ntowards the wall, and it left me in darkness.\n\n'Yes, close it,' he replied, in his familiar voice.  'There, that is pure\nawkwardness!  Why did you hold the candle horizontally?  Be quick, and\nbring another.'\n\nI hurried out in a foolish state of dread, and said to Joseph--'The\nmaster wishes you to take him a light and rekindle the fire.'  For I\ndared not go in myself again just then.\n\nJoseph rattled some fire into the shovel, and went: but he brought it\nback immediately, with the supper-tray in his other hand, explaining that\nMr. Heathcliff was going to bed, and he wanted nothing to eat till\nmorning.  We heard him mount the stairs directly; he did not proceed to\nhis ordinary chamber, but turned into that with the panelled bed: its\nwindow, as I mentioned before, is wide enough for anybody to get through;\nand it struck me that he plotted another midnight excursion, of which he\nhad rather we had no suspicion.\n\n'Is he a ghoul or a vampire?' I mused.  I had read of such hideous\nincarnate demons.  And then I set myself to reflect how I had tended him\nin infancy, and watched him grow to youth, and followed him almost\nthrough his whole course; and what absurd nonsense it was to yield to\nthat sense of horror.  'But where did he come from, the little dark\nthing, harboured by a good man to his bane?' muttered Superstition, as I\ndozed into unconsciousness.  And I began, half dreaming, to weary myself\nwith imagining some fit parentage for him; and, repeating my waking\nmeditations, I tracked his existence over again, with grim variations; at\nlast, picturing his death and funeral: of which, all I can remember is,\nbeing exceedingly vexed at having the task of dictating an inscription\nfor his monument, and consulting the sexton about it; and, as he had no\nsurname, and we could not tell his age, we were obliged to content\nourselves with the single word, 'Heathcliff.'  That came true: we were.\nIf you enter the kirkyard, you'll read, on his headstone, only that, and\nthe date of his death.\n\nDawn restored me to common sense.  I rose, and went into the garden, as\nsoon as I could see, to ascertain if there were any footmarks under his\nwindow.  There were none.  'He has stayed at home,' I thought, 'and he'll\nbe all right to-day.'  I prepared breakfast for the household, as was my\nusual custom, but told Hareton and Catherine to get theirs ere the master\ncame down, for he lay late.  They preferred taking it out of doors, under\nthe trees, and I set a little table to accommodate them.\n\nOn my re-entrance, I found Mr. Heathcliff below.  He and Joseph were\nconversing about some farming business; he gave clear, minute directions\nconcerning the matter discussed, but he spoke rapidly, and turned his\nhead continually aside, and had the same excited expression, even more\nexaggerated.  When Joseph quitted the room he took his seat in the place\nhe generally chose, and I put a basin of coffee before him.  He drew it\nnearer, and then rested his arms on the table, and looked at the opposite\nwall, as I supposed, surveying one particular portion, up and down, with\nglittering, restless eyes, and with such eager interest that he stopped\nbreathing during half a minute together.\n\n'Come now,' I exclaimed, pushing some bread against his hand, 'eat and\ndrink that, while it is hot: it has been waiting near an hour.'\n\nHe didn't notice me, and yet he smiled.  I'd rather have seen him gnash\nhis teeth than smile so.\n\n'Mr. Heathcliff! master!' I cried, 'don't, for God's sake, stare as if\nyou saw an unearthly vision.'\n\n'Don't, for God's sake, shout so loud,' he replied.  'Turn round, and\ntell me, are we by ourselves?'\n\n'Of course,' was my answer; 'of course we are.'\n\nStill, I involuntarily obeyed him, as if I was not quite sure.  With a\nsweep of his hand he cleared a vacant space in front among the breakfast\nthings, and leant forward to gaze more at his ease.\n\nNow, I perceived he was not looking at the wall; for when I regarded him\nalone, it seemed exactly that he gazed at something within two yards'\ndistance.  And whatever it was, it communicated, apparently, both\npleasure and pain in exquisite extremes: at least the anguished, yet\nraptured, expression of his countenance suggested that idea.  The fancied\nobject was not fixed, either: his eyes pursued it with unwearied\ndiligence, and, even in speaking to me, were never weaned away.  I vainly\nreminded him of his protracted abstinence from food: if he stirred to\ntouch anything in compliance with my entreaties, if he stretched his hand\nout to get a piece of bread, his fingers clenched before they reached it,\nand remained on the table, forgetful of their aim.\n\nI sat, a model of patience, trying to attract his absorbed attention from\nits engrossing speculation; till he grew irritable, and got up, asking\nwhy I would not allow him to have his own time in taking his meals? and\nsaying that on the next occasion I needn't wait: I might set the things\ndown and go.  Having uttered these words he left the house, slowly\nsauntered down the garden path, and disappeared through the gate.\n\nThe hours crept anxiously by: another evening came.  I did not retire to\nrest till late, and when I did, I could not sleep.  He returned after\nmidnight, and, instead of going to bed, shut himself into the room\nbeneath.  I listened, and tossed about, and, finally, dressed and\ndescended.  It was too irksome to lie there, harassing my brain with a\nhundred idle misgivings.\n\nI distinguished Mr. Heathcliff's step, restlessly measuring the floor,\nand he frequently broke the silence by a deep inspiration, resembling a\ngroan.  He muttered detached words also; the only one I could catch was\nthe name of Catherine, coupled with some wild term of endearment or\nsuffering; and spoken as one would speak to a person present; low and\nearnest, and wrung from the depth of his soul.  I had not courage to walk\nstraight into the apartment; but I desired to divert him from his\nreverie, and therefore fell foul of the kitchen fire, stirred it, and\nbegan to scrape the cinders.  It drew him forth sooner than I expected.\nHe opened the door immediately, and said--'Nelly, come here--is it\nmorning?  Come in with your light.'\n\n'It is striking four,' I answered.  'You want a candle to take up-stairs:\nyou might have lit one at this fire.'\n\n'No, I don't wish to go up-stairs,' he said.  'Come in, and kindle _me_ a\nfire, and do anything there is to do about the room.'\n\n'I must blow the coals red first, before I can carry any,' I replied,\ngetting a chair and the bellows.\n\nHe roamed to and fro, meantime, in a state approaching distraction; his\nheavy sighs succeeding each other so thick as to leave no space for\ncommon breathing between.\n\n'When day breaks I'll send for Green,' he said; 'I wish to make some\nlegal inquiries of him while I can bestow a thought on those matters, and\nwhile I can act calmly.  I have not written my will yet; and how to leave\nmy property I cannot determine.  I wish I could annihilate it from the\nface of the earth.'\n\n'I would not talk so, Mr. Heathcliff,' I interposed. 'Let your will be a\nwhile: you'll be spared to repent of your many injustices yet! I never\nexpected that your nerves would be disordered: they are, at present,\nmarvellously so, however; and almost entirely through your own fault.\nThe way you've passed these three last days might knock up a Titan. Do\ntake some food, and some repose. You need only look at yourself in a\nglass to see how you require both. Your cheeks are hollow, and your eyes\nblood-shot, like a person starving with hunger and going blind with loss\nof sleep.'\n\n'It is not my fault that I cannot eat or rest,' he replied.  'I assure\nyou it is through no settled designs.  I'll do both, as soon as I\npossibly can.  But you might as well bid a man struggling in the water\nrest within arms' length of the shore!  I must reach it first, and then\nI'll rest.  Well, never mind Mr. Green: as to repenting of my injustices,\nI've done no injustice, and I repent of nothing.  I'm too happy; and yet\nI'm not happy enough.  My soul's bliss kills my body, but does not\nsatisfy itself.'\n\n'Happy, master?' I cried.  'Strange happiness!  If you would hear me\nwithout being angry, I might offer some advice that would make you\nhappier.'\n\n'What is that?' he asked.  'Give it.'\n\n'You are aware, Mr. Heathcliff,' I said, 'that from the time you were\nthirteen years old you have lived a selfish, unchristian life; and\nprobably hardly had a Bible in your hands during all that period.  You\nmust have forgotten the contents of the book, and you may not have space\nto search it now.  Could it be hurtful to send for some one--some\nminister of any denomination, it does not matter which--to explain it,\nand show you how very far you have erred from its precepts; and how unfit\nyou will be for its heaven, unless a change takes place before you die?'\n\n'I'm rather obliged than angry, Nelly,' he said, 'for you remind me of\nthe manner in which I desire to be buried.  It is to be carried to the\nchurchyard in the evening.  You and Hareton may, if you please, accompany\nme: and mind, particularly, to notice that the sexton obeys my directions\nconcerning the two coffins!  No minister need come; nor need anything be\nsaid over me.--I tell you I have nearly attained _my_ heaven; and that of\nothers is altogether unvalued and uncoveted by me.'\n\n'And supposing you persevered in your obstinate fast, and died by that\nmeans, and they refused to bury you in the precincts of the kirk?' I\nsaid, shocked at his godless indifference.  'How would you like it?'\n\n'They won't do that,' he replied: 'if they did, you must have me removed\nsecretly; and if you neglect it you shall prove, practically, that the\ndead are not annihilated!'\n\nAs soon as he heard the other members of the family stirring he retired\nto his den, and I breathed freer.  But in the afternoon, while Joseph and\nHareton were at their work, he came into the kitchen again, and, with a\nwild look, bid me come and sit in the house: he wanted somebody with him.\nI declined; telling him plainly that his strange talk and manner\nfrightened me, and I had neither the nerve nor the will to be his\ncompanion alone.\n\n'I believe you think me a fiend,' he said, with his dismal laugh:\n'something too horrible to live under a decent roof.'  Then turning to\nCatherine, who was there, and who drew behind me at his approach, he\nadded, half sneeringly,--'Will _you_ come, chuck?  I'll not hurt you.  No!\nto you I've made myself worse than the devil.  Well, there is _one_ who\nwon't shrink from my company!  By God! she's relentless.  Oh, damn it!\nIt's unutterably too much for flesh and blood to bear--even mine.'\n\nHe solicited the society of no one more.  At dusk he went into his\nchamber.  Through the whole night, and far into the morning, we heard him\ngroaning and murmuring to himself.  Hareton was anxious to enter; but I\nbid him fetch Mr. Kenneth, and he should go in and see him.  When he\ncame, and I requested admittance and tried to open the door, I found it\nlocked; and Heathcliff bid us be damned.  He was better, and would be\nleft alone; so the doctor went away.\n\nThe following evening was very wet: indeed, it poured down till day-dawn;\nand, as I took my morning walk round the house, I observed the master's\nwindow swinging open, and the rain driving straight in.  He cannot be in\nbed, I thought: those showers would drench him through.  He must either\nbe up or out.  But I'll make no more ado, I'll go boldly and look.'\n\nHaving succeeded in obtaining entrance with another key, I ran to unclose\nthe panels, for the chamber was vacant; quickly pushing them aside, I\npeeped in.  Mr. Heathcliff was there--laid on his back.  His eyes met\nmine so keen and fierce, I started; and then he seemed to smile.  I could\nnot think him dead: but his face and throat were washed with rain; the\nbed-clothes dripped, and he was perfectly still.  The lattice, flapping\nto and fro, had grazed one hand that rested on the sill; no blood\ntrickled from the broken skin, and when I put my fingers to it, I could\ndoubt no more: he was dead and stark!\n\nI hasped the window; I combed his black long hair from his forehead; I\ntried to close his eyes: to extinguish, if possible, that frightful,\nlife-like gaze of exultation before any one else beheld it. They would\nnot shut: they seemed to sneer at my attempts; and his parted lips and\nsharp white teeth sneered too! Taken with another fit of cowardice, I\ncried out for Joseph. Joseph shuffled up and made a noise, but\nresolutely refused to meddle with him.\n\n'Th' divil's harried off his soul,' he cried, 'and he may hev' his\ncarcass into t' bargin, for aught I care!  Ech! what a wicked 'un he\nlooks, girning at death!' and the old sinner grinned in mockery.  I\nthought he intended to cut a caper round the bed; but suddenly composing\nhimself, he fell on his knees, and raised his hands, and returned thanks\nthat the lawful master and the ancient stock were restored to their\nrights.\n\nI felt stunned by the awful event; and my memory unavoidably recurred to\nformer times with a sort of oppressive sadness.  But poor Hareton, the\nmost wronged, was the only one who really suffered much.  He sat by the\ncorpse all night, weeping in bitter earnest.  He pressed its hand, and\nkissed the sarcastic, savage face that every one else shrank from\ncontemplating; and bemoaned him with that strong grief which springs\nnaturally from a generous heart, though it be tough as tempered steel.\n\nMr. Kenneth was perplexed to pronounce of what disorder the master died.\nI concealed the fact of his having swallowed nothing for four days,\nfearing it might lead to trouble, and then, I am persuaded, he did not\nabstain on purpose: it was the consequence of his strange illness, not\nthe cause.\n\nWe buried him, to the scandal of the whole neighbourhood, as he wished.\nEarnshaw and I, the sexton, and six men to carry the coffin, comprehended\nthe whole attendance.  The six men departed when they had let it down\ninto the grave: we stayed to see it covered.  Hareton, with a streaming\nface, dug green sods, and laid them over the brown mould himself: at\npresent it is as smooth and verdant as its companion mounds--and I hope\nits tenant sleeps as soundly.  But the country folks, if you ask them,\nwould swear on the Bible that he _walks_: there are those who speak to\nhaving met him near the church, and on the moor, and even within this\nhouse.  Idle tales, you'll say, and so say I.  Yet that old man by the\nkitchen fire affirms he has seen two on 'em looking out of his chamber\nwindow on every rainy night since his death:--and an odd thing happened\nto me about a month ago.  I was going to the Grange one evening--a dark\nevening, threatening thunder--and, just at the turn of the Heights, I\nencountered a little boy with a sheep and two lambs before him; he was\ncrying terribly; and I supposed the lambs were skittish, and would not be\nguided.\n\n'What is the matter, my little man?' I asked.\n\n'There's Heathcliff and a woman yonder, under t' nab,' he blubbered, 'un'\nI darnut pass 'em.'\n\nI saw nothing; but neither the sheep nor he would go on so I bid him take\nthe road lower down.  He probably raised the phantoms from thinking, as\nhe traversed the moors alone, on the nonsense he had heard his parents\nand companions repeat.  Yet, still, I don't like being out in the dark\nnow; and I don't like being left by myself in this grim house: I cannot\nhelp it; I shall be glad when they leave it, and shift to the Grange.\n\n'They are going to the Grange, then?' I said.\n\n'Yes,' answered Mrs. Dean, 'as soon as they are married, and that will be\non New Year's Day.'\n\n'And who will live here then?'\n\n'Why, Joseph will take care of the house, and, perhaps, a lad to keep him\ncompany.  They will live in the kitchen, and the rest will be shut up.'\n\n'For the use of such ghosts as choose to inhabit it?' I observed.\n\n'No, Mr. Lockwood,' said Nelly, shaking her head.  'I believe the dead\nare at peace: but it is not right to speak of them with levity.'\n\nAt that moment the garden gate swung to; the ramblers were returning.\n\n'_They_ are afraid of nothing,' I grumbled, watching their approach\nthrough the window.  'Together, they would brave Satan and all his\nlegions.'\n\nAs they stepped on to the door-stones, and halted to take a last look at\nthe moon--or, more correctly, at each other by her light--I felt\nirresistibly impelled to escape them again; and, pressing a remembrance\ninto the hand of Mrs. Dean, and disregarding her expostulations at my\nrudeness, I vanished through the kitchen as they opened the house-door;\nand so should have confirmed Joseph in his opinion of his\nfellow-servant's gay indiscretions, had he not fortunately recognised me\nfor a respectable character by the sweet ring of a sovereign at his feet.\n\nMy walk home was lengthened by a diversion in the direction of the kirk.\nWhen beneath its walls, I perceived decay had made progress, even in\nseven months: many a window showed black gaps deprived of glass; and\nslates jutted off here and there, beyond the right line of the roof, to\nbe gradually worked off in coming autumn storms.\n\nI sought, and soon discovered, the three headstones on the slope next the\nmoor: the middle one grey, and half buried in the heath; Edgar Linton's\nonly harmonized by the turf and moss creeping up its foot; Heathcliff's\nstill bare.\n\nI lingered round them, under that benign sky: watched the moths\nfluttering among the heath and harebells, listened to the soft wind\nbreathing through the grass, and wondered how any one could ever imagine\nunquiet slumbers for the sleepers in that quiet earth.", "title": "Wuthering Heights"}
