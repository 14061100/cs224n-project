Helptext is available for running our code by doing:
python ass_train.py -h
python ass_test.py -h

The embedding can be swapped to SkipThoughts() to implement the SkipThoughts implementation. Default is
our standard GloVe word embeddings.

To download our dataset, feel free to use our utility code available in download_data/

glove data needs to be downloaded to access the glove embedding (default)
skipthoughts data needs to be downloaded to access the ST embeddings

We reccommend training on a system with GPU support (theano supports this, you just need the GPUs)
